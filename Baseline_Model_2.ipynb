              " 'Paisean Faisean (\"Fashion Passion\") is an Irish language television dating show broadcast on TG4. It was presented in the first three series by Aoife Ní Thuairisg, and in the fourth series by Bláthnaid Nic Dhonnchadha and Mairéad Ní Chuaig. The fifth series saw Nic Dhonnchadha present alongside Síle Seoige. == Format == Magma films bought the format from Digital Rights Group with the line \"Boys buy clothes for girls\" from that Clodagh Freeman created the series. Magma films get a percentage of international rights as they bought the format from paper and brought it to the screen first. The format of the show traditionally involves three men choosing outfits for one woman – although the episode aired on 19 November 2007 featured four gay men. The suitors are shown a short pre-recorded clip of the girl, wearing jeans and a white T-shirt, in which she introduces herself and gives clues as to which clothes she likes. Each man shops in a different shop, and has €400 spending money (raised to €500 in the fourth season). The person for whom the outfits are purchased must then base her choice of \"date\" on which outfit she likes the best. The winning man and the woman then share dinner in a restaurant. Magma Films, producers of Paisean Faisean, have since sold the rights to Zoo Productions who will produce the series for MTV under the title Style Date. The show has also been produced in Turkey, while a Polish version is expected later on this year. == Controversies == === Advertising === In the show\\'s second season it raised some controversy, when complaints were upheld against two of its advertisements by the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland; a billboard advertisement depicting a woman in slightly revealing clothing led to complaints of \\'reducing women to mere sexual objects\\'; and a radio advertisement in which a woman complains about people being able to see her underwear, with the response \\'Not if you\\'re not wearing any, they won\\'t\\', led to complaints about sexual equality. Angela Kerins, Chair of the Equality Authority Board in Ireland came out strongly to confirm their condemnation of the advertisements. === Gay contestants === Series four included an episode with gay couples. Ní Thuairisg refused to film episodes featuring gay couples, claiming \"incompatibility with her religious beliefs\" (she is a Jehovah\\'s Witness); this may have contributed to her departure. == References == == External links == Official site on TG4.ie in Irish Official site on TG4.ie in English',\n",
              " 'The 1913 College Football All-America team is composed of college football players who were selected as All-Americans for the 1913 college football season. The only two selectors who have been recognized as \"official\" selectors by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) for the 1913 season are Walter Camp and the International News Service (INS). Camp\\'s All-America Team was published in Collier\\'s Weekly. The INS was founded in 1909 by William Randolph Hearst, and its sports editor Frank G. Menke selected the INS All-America team. Other sports writers, newspapers, coaches selecting All-America teams in 1913 included Harper\\'s Weekly, Fielding H. Yost, and Parke H. Davis. == Consensus All-Americans == In its official record book, the NCAA designates players who were selected by either Camp or INS as \"consensus\" All-Americans. Using this criteria, the NCAA recognizes 15 as \"consensus\" All-Americans for the 1913 season. The consensus players are identified in bold on the main list below (\"All-Americans of 1913\"). Camp and INS unanimously selected the following seven players as All-Americans: Charles Brickley, fullback for Harvard. Brickley later became a player and coach in the early years of professional football. He was the coach of the New York Brickley Giants in the first year of play in the National Football League. In 1928, he was convicted on four counts of larceny and bucketing orders from customers of his stock brokerage firm. John \"Babe\" Brown, guard for Navy. Brown was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1951 as part of the first group of inductees. During World War II, Admiral John Brown oversaw submarine operations in the South Pacific. He later served as athletics director at the United States Naval Academy. James Craig, halfback for Michigan. Craig was also one of the best hurdlers in the country, breaking the world indoor record in the high hurdles in 1911 and winning the intercollegiate championship in the low hurdles in 1912. His older brother, Ralph Craig, won gold medals in the 100 and 200-meter events at the 1912 Olympics. Paul Des Jardien, center for Chicago. At six feet, five inches in height, but weighing only 190 pounds, Des Jardien was nicknamed \"Shorty.\" He led the 1913 Chicago Maroons football team to an undefeated 7–0 record and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1955. Des Jardien was a multi-sport star who also briefly played professional baseball as a pitcher for the Cleveland Indians in 1916. Robert Hogsett, end for Dartmouth. Hogsett was the captain of the 1913 Dartmouth Big Green football team that compiled a 7–1–0 record and outscored opponents 218 to 79, including victories over Princeton and Penn. Eddie Mahan, halfback for Harvard. Mahan was selected as a first-team All-American three consecutive years from 1913 to 1915. He was widely regarded as one of the greatest players in the first 50 years of the sport and was named by Jim Thorpe as the greatest football player of all time. In 1951, Mahan was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame as part of the first group of inductees. Louis A. Merrilat, end for Army. Merrilat was a first-team All-American in both 1913 and 1914. He was severely wounded by airplane machine gun fire during World War I, but went on to play in the NFL as a 33-year-old rookie in 1925. He later became a soldier of fortune, training Iran\\'s Persian Guard, working with the Chinese Army in the 1930s, and serving in the French Foreign Legion. == All-Americans of 1913 == === Ends === Robert Hogsett, Dartmouth (WC–1; INS-1; MFP-2; SBH-1; TET-1) Louis A.

              " 'Miss (pronounced ) is an English language honorific typically used for a girl, for an unmarried woman (when not using another title such as \"Doctor\" or \"Dame\"), or for a married woman retaining her maiden name. Originating in the 17th century, it is a contraction of mistress. Its counterparts are Mrs., used for a married women who has taken her husband\\'s name, and Ms., which can be used for married or unmarried women. The plural Misses may be used, such as in The Misses Doe. The traditional French \"Mademoiselle\" (abbreviation \"Mlle\") may also be used as the plural in English language conversation or correspondence. In Australian, British, and Irish schools the term \\'miss\\' is often used by pupils in addressing any female teacher. == Use alone as a form of address == Miss is an honorific for addressing a woman who is not married, and is known by her maiden name. It is a shortened form of mistress, and departed from misses/missus which became used to signify marital attachment in the 18th and 19th centuries. It does not imply age, though youth corresponds (as marriage implies adulthood). == Racial discrimination and the term Miss == Being addressed with \"Miss\" or \"Mrs.\" was frequently denied to black women in the Southern United States in the past. Mary Hamilton, a civil rights protester arrested in 1963 in Gadsden, Alabama, refused to answer the prosecutor in a subsequent hearing unless he stopped addressing her as \"Mary\", demanding that instead she be called \"Miss Hamilton\". She was subsequently jailed for contempt of court after refusing to pay a fine. This led to Hamilton v. Alabama, 376 U.S. 650 (1964), a United States Supreme Court case in which the court held that Mary Hamilton was entitled to the same courteous forms of address customarily reserved solely for whites in the Southern United States and that calling a black person by their first name in a formal context was \"a form of racial discrimination\". == See also == Fräulein (German-language term for Miss, gained popularity due to the Fräuleinwunder, lit.

              " 'Kira is a mostly feminine name of multiple origins and meanings. The feminine form is pronounced KEER-ə or KEE-rə. It might be a feminine form of the name Kiran, pronounced KEER-ən. Kiran is of Hindi and Sanskrit origin, meaning \"beam of light\". In Ancient Hebrew \"Keren\" means both \"a horn\" and \"a beam of light\". Besides Sanskrit and Hebrew there might be other etymologies from Egyptian, where the word Ki-Ra means \"like Ra\", or Persian. Due to the Greek interpretation of the Persian king\\'s name Kourosh (کوروش, Kūrosh) as Κύρος (Kýros) – which was obviously modeled after the Greek word κύριος (kýrios \"lord\"), the feminine form being κυρία (kyría) – Kyra (or Kira) can also be understood as a variant. Therefore, it is also in use as a feminine form of the Greek diminutive form Cyril. In Russian Kira (Ки́ра) is the feminine form of the masculine name Kir, meaning \"mistress, ruler\", but can translate to \"leader of the people\", \"one the people look to\" or \"beloved\". Kira could also have arrived into Russian from the Persian-Greek name Kyra.

              " 'Marianne Christine Stang Ihlen (Norwegian: [mɑrɪˈɑ̂nːə ˈîːln̩]; 18 May 1935 – 28 July 2016) was a Norwegian woman who was the first wife of author Axel Jensen and later the muse and girlfriend of Leonard Cohen for several years in the 1960s. She was the subject of Cohen\\'s 1967 song \"So Long, Marianne\". == Early life == Ihlen was born on 18 May 1935 in Larkollen, Norway, the elder of the two children of Ingeborg Louise (née Kloed, 29 April 1909 – 5 September 2003) and Nils Ihlen (27 October 1906 – 16 November 1959). Known as “Mosse”, her mother was the daughter of opera singer Wilhelm Cappelle Kloed and had had a privileged childhood, including having been sent to Paris to learn French. Ihlen was raised in Oslo where her father was a lawyer. During the Second World War Ihlen\\'s father contracted tuberculosis which required a long period of treatment at the Mesnali sanatorium near Lillehammer. Her younger brother, Nils, when he was two suffered from tuberculosis for more than a year during which while her mother nursed her son and husband Ihlen spent time with her maternal grandmother in Larkollen.As the 1950s progressed the family’s financial situation became strained as Ihlen’s father lacked the lung capacity as a result of his tuberculosis treatment to work for an entire day in court. This put pressure on the couple’s relationship and forced her mother to take a job in the licence office of the national broadcasting company. Ihlen attended Berle Girls’ School. == Meets Axel Jensen == While her father had hoped that she would become a doctor or lawyer, Ihlen did not know what she wanted to do, so opted to take business studies at the Oslo Municipal Trade School. Graduating at the age of 19 Ihlen took a number of jobs, including as secretary at an attorney’s office in Oslo, Kristiania Shoe Store, the Norsk Bygdekino cinema, and in 1956 at the Save the Children charitable organization. She also briefly worked as an au pair in Newcastle, in England.In 1954, while travelling in a car with one of her girlfriends along Majorstua Street, they were approached by budding 22 year old Norwegian avant-garde writer Axel Jensen, who invited her to a party. Once at the party Ihlen thought he was fascinating and was spellbound by everything he said. Jensen subsequently telephoned her and they met up in Dovrehallen, a student pub at which they committed to a relationship. Jensen took whatever work he could find to support himself as he wrote short stories for newspapers and magazines. He introduced Ihlen to works by Nietzsche, Carl Jung and Ouspensky in an effort to expand her horizons. In 1955, Jensen self-published his first book Dyretemmerens kors. Ihlen clashed with her father over Jensen, curfews, and housework, and when she was twenty he refused her permission to spend Easter with Jensen and their friends in a mountain cabin. Her father thought that Jensen, who came from a broken home, lacked a good education, a job and a place of his own to live, unlike the children of his middle class friends and acquaintances. When she was 22, Ihlen was inspired while reading Henrik Ibsen’s The Wild Duck with her mother’s cousin who was an actress, to also become an actress. She then studied to take the entrance examination to the National Academy of Theatre in Oslo, but lost her nerve partly due to her parents\\' objections and did not take the examination.In 1957, Jensen’s novel Ikaros – ung mann i Sahara (Icarus – A Young Man in Sahara) was published by Henrik Groth of Cappelen, and was highly praised. Ihlen thought they had a committed relationship with long held plans to travel to Greece, but later that same year, one evening, Jensen out of the blue introduced her to another young woman at the Theatre Café, and informed Ihlen that there would be no trip to Greece as he was leaving tomorrow with the other woman for Egypt. Ihlen stormed out and made her way in a state of shock back to where she was staying, only to be awakened at 4 o’clock by Jensen at the doorstep saying, “We’re going to Greece! It’s you I want to travel with!” == Hydra == In mid-November, over her parents’ objections, the reunited couple departed by train for Greece, with plans to be away for a year, with Jensen intending to spend the time writing. Disembarking from the train in Hamburg, they purchased a second-hand Volkswagen Beetle. Driving south they visited Venice and Rome before passing through Yugoslavia into Greece. On the way south from Thessaloniki, Ihlen was forced to have an emergency operation for appendicitis in the village of Lamia. Ihlen remained in hospital for a week recovering, and it was not until December that they reached Athens, where they stayed with their friends Per and Else Berit who had moved there the year before. Jensen had originally intended that they rent an apartment in Athens, but their friends suggested they could live more cheaply on the island of Hydra, which was three hours away by ferry. After visiting Delphi the couple drove down to Erminoni in the Peloponnese, where their landlady at the place they stayed allowed them to park their car in her garden. It was from there that they took a ferry to Hydra.After initially renting, Jensen used part of an advance of 40,000 kroner that he had received from Groth for his next book to purchase a house on Kala Pigadia Street on Hydra for approximately US$2,500. After making repairs to the house, the couple were left with just over US$2,000 on which to live on until Jensen’s next book was published, with the house offered as security for one year’s line of credit at a local grocery store.The house was simple with an outside toilet and electricity for only one hour in the evening and one hour in the morning. Otherwise, they used paraffin lamps. The couple soon became a component part of the foreign community on the island, and friends with Charmian Clift and her husband, novelist George Johnston. Some months later the Swedish writer Göran Tunström arrived on the island and rented a house close by, becoming a friend. Ihlen remained on Hydra when it was necessary for Jensen to travel back several times to Norway to capitalise on the success of his novel, Ikaros – ung mann i Sahara.On one of these trips Jensen met a woman called Sonja, who he became besotted with after five days of acquaintance. Upon his return to Hydra in late 1958, he informed Ihlen that the woman was coming to the island and that his relationship with her was over. In response Ihlen packed a bag and left to stay in Athens for a few days, with the idea of getting a job there.She was approached by Eileen Barclay who was married to Sam Barclay, an heir to Barclays Bank. They had a schooner, the Stromie Seas, which they chartered out to wealthy individuals over the summer. Eileen was eager to have a break from her position as cook and hostess on the yacht and spend time with her new lover. She suggested that Ihlen replace her on the schooner where she could also be a nanny for the couple’s seven-year-old son. The next day she reported to Barclay at Piraeus, and spent the next six weeks working on the schooner as it sailed among various Greek islands, including Santorini. Thrown together, Barclay and Ihlen had a romantic relationship during this period.At the end of the charter Ihlen returned to stay with Per and Else Berit in Athens, who observed that the experience had transformed her into a serene and more-confident person, who, while she still loved Jensen, was prepared to live without him.Meanwhile Jensen had been on a six week long drinking binge as he had purchased a ticket for Sonja to travel to join him in Greece, only to find that she had sold the ticket and had kept the money. == Marriage == By chance, while Jensen was in Athens he met the \"new\" Marianne, falling in love with her again. He immediately asked her to marry him and she accepted. They married on 22 October 1958 in the Anglican Church in Athens, against her parents\\' wishes. They then returned to their house on Hydra. While Jensen had by now delivered the first draft of his novel to Cappelen, to bring in extra money both Ihlen and Jensen worked over the spring of 1959 on Sam Barclay’s schooner as it carried a group of English students around the Greek islands. With his new novel Line, printed and approaching its publishing date, both Ihlen (who was by now pregnant) and Jensen travelled to Oslo, where both were able to catch up with family and friends. Once the novel was published to great acclaim, Jensen used the incoming money to travel in October with Ihlen, Per and Else Brent to Stockholm, where via friends they purchased a Karmann Ghia. Due to Jensen being unable to drive due to a drunk driving conviction, Ihlen drove the car back to Oslo. It was while they were back in Oslo that Ihlen’s father died of kidney failure in November 1959. Ihlen’s son Axel Joachim was born on 21 January 1960 in Oslo. Ihlen temporarily moved in with her mother, as a week after his son’s birth Jensen travelled back to Hydra in order to avoid paying Norwegian taxes. Four months later Ihlen and Axel Joachim followed. == Leonard Cohen == While Ihlen had been in Norway, Leonard Cohen had moved to Hydra, renting a house for US$14 a month. While he had noticed her following her return, they had never been introduced. Ihlen described their meeting in Katsikas’ store in early 1960: I was standing in a shop with my basket waiting to pick up bottled water and milk. And I was crying in front of a Greek lady. Then, there he was (Cohen) standing in the door way with the sun behind him, and you don’t see the face, just the contours, and so I hear his voice saying ‘would you like to join us? Come into the sun. We’re sitting outside’. He was wearing a beautiful little sixpence (sikspens) cap. When my eyes met his, I felt it throughout my body. After finishing her shopping Ihlen joined Cohen and three or four other foreigners at a table outside for a period before returning home. By now Ihlen was aware that her husband had a new lover, the American painter Patricia Amlin, who he was openly carrying on with.With their relationship deteriorating, Jensen decided to leave on his sailboat, a BBII that he had had transported by ship to Piraeus. A friend, while visiting Athens, reported back to Ihlen that he had seen Jensen and Amlin together, which finally convinced her that her marriage was finished. Jensen later confirmed in a May 1960 letter to her that he had left Hydra by himself rather than openly with Amlin, in order to spare Ihlen the public humiliation. Rather than return to Norway, Ihlen decided to stay on Hydra with her baby son, partly due to her deepening friendship with Cohen.Soon after Ihlen’s and Jensen’s separation, Amlin was badly injured when she crashed Jensen’s Karmann Ghia near Athens and was flung out of the car, breaking many bones and developing gangrene, which required amputation of a thumb. Jensen struggled with the situation and three days later telegrammed Ihlen asking for her help. At Cohen’s urging, Ihlen left her son with him and travelled to Athens, where she maintained a vigil by Amlin’s bed allowing Jensen to rest. After three days she returned to Hydra. After Jensen left her, Ihlen received small financial payments from Jensen’s publisher, Cappelen. Jensen allowed her to live in the house and following their formal divorce a year later transferred ownership to her and their son. After taking Amlin back to America and travelling around Mexico with John Starr Cooke, Jensen returned to Hydra in the summer of 1960 and rented a house in which to write. Jensen remained friendly with both Ihlen and Cohen. Eventually Jensen was expelled from Hydra in 1962 following a drunken altercation with a policeman, after which Ihlen never saw him again, though they continued to correspond.The Karmann Ghia had survived Amlin’s crash practically undamaged. It had been registered in Ihlen’s name, but there was a need for it to be returned to Norway in order to avoid having to pay import duties, which Ihlen would struggle to pay. She was reluctant to make the long journey with her son. As Cohen’s money was running out and he needed to return to Canada to make some more, he offered to accompany her, before continuing across the Atlantic. Plans changed when by chance Ihlen came across some SAS Norwegian aircrew while they were relaxing in Hydra. Believing them to be trustworthy, she impulsively asked if they would take her six month son back to his grandmother in Oslo, rather than him having to endure a long drive across Europe. They agreed and in August a few days later Ihlen and Cohen delivered the baby to the aircrew at Athens airport. After receiving a telegram from her mother that her son had arrived safely, Ihlen and Cohen returned to Hydra where in September of that year, having received an inheritance from his grandmother, Cohen purchased a whitewashed L-shaped house for US$1,500. Ihlen divided her time between her house and Cohen’s, though they took small breaks to explore the mainland together. In November 1960 Ihlen and Cohen drove to Norway, exploring Europe as they went. Cohen then travelled on from Oslo to Canada. Ihlen signed her legal separation papers in February 1961, though her divorce would not be finalised for another year. To support herself she took a job as production assistant and substitute script girl on the film Tonny released in 1962. Cohen eventually scraped together sufficient funds and sent Ihlen a telegram in the autumn of 1961: “Have house. All I need is my woman and her son. Love Leonard.”She and her by now 18-month-old son joined him in Montreal, where Cohen increasingly became a surrogate father to Axel Joachim. The three lived in Montreal for one year before returning to Hydra in 1963. While she had been away Ihlen had rented out the house on Kala Pigadia Street, which she returned to live in before soon moving in with Cohen. They engaged an elderly neighbour Kyria Sophia to help around the house while Cohen wrote, and Ihlen looked after her son and Cohen. Ihlen and Cohen grew their own marijuana with Ihlen occasionally mixing it into meatballs.After two years of work, Cohen completed his novel The Favourite Game, which was published in October 1963. Leaving her son with his grandmother before he joined her, Ihlen spent a couple of months in Paris where she tried to obtain work before travelling on to Oslo to attend the funeral of her paternal grandmother. Meanwhile Cohen had been in London and Canada, returning to Hydra where once again he created a family unit with Ihlen and her son. Cohen attempted to gain a living through his writing while his muse was a housewife and lover. Ihlen occasionally modelled for Hydra based artists, among them Anthony Kingsmill and Marcelle Maltais, whose painting of her resides in the Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec.Cohen returned to Montreal for a short period before he obtained passage on a cargo ship and re-joined Ihlen, who was then visiting Oslo. Cohen wrote to his friend Irving Layton that Ihlen: ... seems to have endured and ruined the women I ‘ve known after her and I’ve got to confront her mystery in the snow. She is so blonde in my heart! Once the couple were back on Hydra Cohen commenced work in 1964 on his second novel Beautiful Losers. During this writing period he would often leave Ihlen on Hydra while he returned to Canada for short periods to work and replenish his funds, as well as provide readings of his poetry. The only time they travelled as a family was a short trip to London in the spring of 1965. By the time Beautiful Losers was published in 1966 to disappointing sales and initially unsympathetic reviews, Cohen had come to the realisation that he would not be able to make a living as a writer. At the same time his relationship with Ihlen had become strained, due to the time he had spent away from her in Hydra. To improve their relationship, the couple moved to Montreal together with Ihlen’s son where they took up residence in an apartment at 3657 Aylmer Street. Ihlen was able to obtain a job in a woman’s clothing boutique on Sainte Catherine Street. By this time folk music was becoming popular, especially in New York. On visits to the city, Cohen had heard both Bob Dylan and Joan Baez perform. After some time back in Montreal, Cohen decided to head south in search of work as a studio musician in Nashville. While passing through New York he was introduced to singer Judy Collins, who after hearing some of his songs encouraged him to continue. By now having run out of money, he returned to Ihlen in Montreal, instead of continuing on to Nashville. It was back in Montreal that Cohen wrote Suzanne, which was taken up by Collins and became his first successful song. Deciding in the winter of 1966 that she needed a break from Cohen, Ihlen took Axel Joachim along on a visit to her friend John Starr Cooke near Oaxaca in Mexico. It was here that for the only time in her life Ihlen tried a few LSD trips, in an attempt to provide some insight into her dilemmas.Believed that its unstructured regime would be beneficial, Ihlen sent seven year old Axel Joachim to board at experimental Summerhill School in England. There were children of a number of other Hydra expats there. However Axel Joachim was unmoored by the experience, and became desperate for his mother. He spent a year or two there. He then had no further real schooling until at the age of 12 he was sent to a strict Swiss boarding school.In 1968, while living alone on Hydra, Ihlen met 20-year-old Nick Broomfield, with whom she had a nearly year-long relationship, during which she was instrumental in encouraging him to become a documentary maker and to make his first film, Who Cares? in 1971.Axel Joachim returned to his mother and was nine years old when the pair moved to New York where Cohen was then based, with Ihlen hoping to re-establish their relationship. Cohen would not allow her to stay. He claimed that he considered her too pure, and wished to shield her and her son from his current debauched, bohemian lifestyle. Consequently, Ihlen established a separate residence with her friend Carol Zemel who had recently moved to the city on Clinton Street on the Lower East Side. Ihlen and her old friend Jean Marc Appert earned money as street vendors of toy cats, made on the spot out of steel wire and wool yarn. Cohen and Ihlen remained close, with him paying her rent and her son\\'s boarding schools in England and Switzerland as well as his airfare. He took her for visits to the Chelsea Hotel, and to concerts, and introduced her to Andy Warhol, Joni Mitchell and Buffy Sainte-Marie. As Cohen’s fame increased, other women would ring Ihlen’s apartment in an attempt to get to him. While they drifted apart as lovers, Cohen would continue to support Ihlen and provide whatever help he could. Their relationship finally ended in 1972 after the birth of Cohen\\'s son Adam, who was born from his relationship with Suzanne Elrod. While in the city Ihlen undertook a body-oriented psychotherapy with psychotherapist Alexander Lowen. After a year in New York, Ihlen and her son left to divide their time between her family’s home in Larkollen and Hydra. While living in Cohen’s house in Hydra in 1972 with her by now 12-year-old Axel Joachim, she was confronted by Suzanne Elrod with her son Adam Cohen. Elrod wanted the house for herself, so Ihlen was forced to move out. == Return to Norway == In 1973 Ihlen returned with her son to live a permanent, more structured life in Oslo, though she and Cohen stayed in touch periodically for the rest of her life. Whenever he performed in Scandinavia, she visited him backstage. When either of them spoke of their love affair, it was always in the fondest terms.Ihlen took a position with Norwegian Contractors, who specialized in the construction of offshore oil platforms, where she worked in the personnel and foreign departments. She remained employed in the oil industry for the rest of her working life. Axel Joachim was taken on a trip to India at the age of 15 by his father, Jensen, and given LSD. As he grew older, he developed psychiatric problems and after 1979 spent a large part of his life institutionalized in Norway. The 2020 documentary Little Axel explored his life. While employed at Norwegian Contractors Ihlen met engineer Jan Kielland Stang, who had three daughters from a previous marriage and whom she knew from her youth. They married in 1979. Following their marriage they continued to live in Oslo.Ihlen continued to regularly visit Hydra for holidays. Late in her working life, Ihlen assisted actress Juni Dahr by making travel arrangements for her when she toured her solo shows Joan of Arc - Vision through Fire and then Ibsen Women - Put an Eagle in a Cage in Europe, Japan and the United States in the late 1980s and early 1990s. She developed an interest in Tibetan Buddhism via the Centre for Growth in Denmark and spent time painting. == Illness and death == She was diagnosed with leukemia in late July 2016. Her close friend Jan Christian Mollestad contacted Cohen to tell him Ihlen was dying. Leonard Cohen penned a poignant final letter to her, which is often misquoted by the media and others. However, the widely circulated version of the letter was based on an inaccurate verbal recollection by Mollestad which was then transcribed in a radio interview. The actual letter (actually an email) obtained through the Leonard Cohen estate reads: Dearest Marianne, I’m just a little behind you, close enough to take your hand. This old body has given up, just as yours has too. I’ve never forgotten your love and your beauty. But you know that. I don’t have to say any more. Safe travels old friend. See you down the road. Endless love and gratitude. your Leonard She died aged 81 on 28 July 2016, in Oslo. Cohen died later that year on 7 November 2016. == Legacy == Cohen dedicated his third volume of poetry, Flowers for Hitler, to Ihlen with the poems For Marianne and Waiting for Marianne, deal specifically with her. Cohen’s 1972 volume of poetry The Energy of Slaves also refers to Ihlen in Welcome Home. She also directly inspired many of his songs, in particular Bird on the Wire, Hey, That\\'s No Way to Say Goodbye and So Long, Marianne on his first two albums, Songs of Leonard Cohen (1967) and Songs from a Room (1969). The back sleeve of Songs from a Room features a famous photograph of her at Cohen\\'s typewriter, draped in a white towel in their house on Hydra.From a window in that home, Ihlen once saw a bird perched on a newly installed telephone wire and remarked to Cohen that they looked like musical notes; she suggested he write a song about it. Bird on the Wire was the result, one of his most successful songs, with the opening lines: Like a bird on the wire, Like a drunk in a midnight choir, I have tried, in my way, to be free. About his song So Long, Marianne Cohen commented on the back cover of Greatest Hits, 1976: I began this on Aylmer Street in Montreal and finished it a year or so later at the Chelsea Hotel in New York. I didn’t think I was saying goodbye but I guess I was. She gave me many songs, and she has given songs to others too. She is a Muse. A lot of people I know think that there is nothing more important than making a song. Fortunately, this belief arises infrequently in their conversation. Initially, the title line read “Come on, Marianne” and was meant as an invitation to allow changes in their lives. Even before the separation from Ihlen, Cohen replaced the encouraging “come on” with the farewell greeting “so long”. The song \"Moving On\" from Cohen\\'s posthumous 2019 album Thanks for the Dance is also a tribute to Ihlen.Norwegian journalist Kari Hesthamar won the 2006 Prix Europa for her 2005 radio documentary about Ihlen. In 2008, Hesthamar published her biography of Ihlen, So Long, Marianne. Ei Kjærleikshistorie; ECW Press published the English translation So Long, Marianne: A Love Story in 2014.In 2014, in a review of Lana Del Rey\\'s third album, Ultraviolence, Alexandra Molotkow compared Del Rey\\'s persona of surrender to Ihlen\\'s account of her search for independence. Molotkow described Del Rey as an artist, fully in control of her career, who, paradoxically, had chosen a performing persona as a weak and helpless female, who sought to surrender to powerful men. According to Molotkow, who had just read Hesthamar\\'s recently translated biography of Ihlen, even though Ihlen had the reality of the fantasy Del Rey shows in her videos, of the woman socially and economically reliant on a man, Ihlen has described how she became fully independent. According to Molotkow, Hesthamar\\'s book is \"the story of a remarkable woman who was a muse – who has, until now, appeared in history as a man’s idea – and how she found herself. Often, the book reads as a caution against giving up your power.\" Her life and relationship with Cohen was depicted in Nick Broomfield’s 2019 documentary film Marianne & Leonard: Words of Love. In June 2019 a collection of more than 50 love letters written by Leonard Cohen to Ihlen were sold at auction by Christie’s for $876,000 with many selling for more than five times their pre-sale estimates. One letter sold for $56,250.Ihlen was a character in Polly Samson’s 2020 novel A Theatre for Dreamers about the bohemian circle on Hydra in the 1960s. == Notes == == References == == Further reading == Genoni, Paul; Dalziell, Tanya (2018).

              " 'Libya–Spain relations are the bilateral and diplomatic relations between these two countries. Libya has an embassy in Madrid, and Spain has one in Tripoli. == Diplomatic relations == First contacts between the Kingdom of Libya and Francoist Spain after the 1951 Libyan independence began to develop after King Idris paid a visit to Spain in 1953.By means of the exchange of ambassadors, Spain and Libya established full diplomatic relations on 14 January 1961. Cooperation in the energy sector ensued.Following the 1969 coup d\\'etat in Libya and the ascension of Muammar Gaddafi to power, a pragmatic Spain had no problem to continue with the ongoing relations, in the overarching frame of Spanish neutrality towards the struggle between Conservative Arab monarchies and Pan-Arabist rulers taking place within the Arab League, although it did not take long for disagreements to emerge between the two countries over the timetable for the Spanish decolonisation of Western Sahara, and Libya eventually came to provide financial funding to the Polisario Front after 1973.Nonetheless, a 1972 visit to Libya by Spanish Foreign Minister Gregorio López Bravo consolidated existing relations, confirming Libya as a leading energy provider, a circumstance that eventually proved to be a major coup for the Spanish diplomacy in the context of the oil embargo by Arab countries (and ensuing energy crisis) on many Western countries on the wake of Israeli victory in the Yom Kippur War in 1973.Relations were strained in the 1980s, and there were various Libyan interference attempts in Spanish domestic politics, by providing logistic support to a number of political groups. Gadaffi had expected the new PSOE government to remove Spain from NATO membership after it came to power in 1982 and, shortly afterwards the 1986 referendum on the matter, he threatened Spain and Italy with military retaliation in case Libya was attacked.In 2004 a timid normalization of Libya\\'s relations with the international community began. In 2011 Spain was one of the first countries to position itself in favor of the 17 February revolution, actively supporting it in the political and humanitarian assistance fields. In the political arena, Spain recognized in March 2011 the Transitional National Council, provisional government, and a month later moved a special envoy to Benghazi; he was a member of the \"Group of friends of Libya\" and participated in the operation of NATO in defense of the Libyan people. The Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation, Trinidad Jiménez, traveled to Benghazi in June 2011, when military conflict had not yet come to an end. After the beginning of the political transition in Libya, Spain has sought to relaunch bilateral relations by showing its willingness to accompany Libya in the democratization process. With this objective, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation José Manuel García-Margallo, accompanied by the Minister of Development Ana Pastor, visited Tripoli on 16 and 17 December 2012 to convey a message of support from the Spanish government to the new Libyan authorities, and to boost economic and business relations between the countries.After 2014, the Spanish diplomatic mission to Libya operated from Tunisia. On 3 June 2021, on the wake of his official visit to Libya to endorse the process for political transition and reconstruction in the country, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez met with provisional Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh (GNU) and presided over the re-opening of the embassy in Tripoli (which would facilitate the issuance of Schengen visas to Libyan citizens). == Cooperation == Spain was the fifth European donor in humanitarian aid during the Libyan revolution of 2011, contributing more than 7 million euros. The process of political and social changes in Libya and other countries in the wake of the Arab Spring in January–February 2011 has led to a reformulation of the development cooperation policy in the region focusing on the accompaniment of the processes of democratic change. The Masar Program is a Spanish Cooperation program initiated in June 2012, whose purpose is to accompany democratic governance processes in the Arab World, contributing to the modernization and strengthening of institutions and of the key actors in the development of the rule of law, so that public authorities can respond to the needs of their societies, and civil society can be one of the engines of change.The strategic objective of Spanish cooperation in Libya is to contribute to strengthening the country\\'s capacities in its process of reconstruction and political transition. In 2012, Spain financed a demining program of the MAG NGO and the electoral assistance program of the United Nations Mission in Libya. Within the framework of the Masar program, Libya\\'s Deputy Minister of Justice of Libya, Sahar Banoon, traveled to Spain on 17 June 2013 together with a delegation from his ministry to learn about the Spanish prison system with a view to starting collaboration on prison reform in Libya.The promotion of exchanges at the institutional, business and civil society level between Spain and Libya is one of the main aspects of Spanish cooperation through study visits to Spanish institutions and participation in conferences and seminars organized by institutions such as Casa Árabe, Casa Mediterráneo, and Club de Madrid.In the cultural field, the promotion of Spanish culture and language stands out, with the creation of a Spanish reading place at the University of Tripoli in the 2013–2014 academic year. == See also == Foreign relations of Libya Foreign relations of Spain == References == Citations BibliographyJurado Anaya, Jesús (2012). \"Estudios de caso de la política exterior española hacia el Mundo Árabe y Musulmán: Libia\".

              " 'Christopher William Darwin (born 16 March 1961 in London) is an environmentalist and nature conservationist who lives in Australia and works on his goal of halting the global mass extinction of species. He is the ambassador of the charity Bush Heritage Australia. He is the great-great-grandson of Charles Darwin. == Biography == Darwin was born in 1961 in London. He is the son of George Erasmus Darwin, a metallurgist, known as \"Erasmus\", and his wife Shuna (née Service). He has an older brother Robert George Darwin and a younger sister, Sarah Darwin Vogel, a evolutionary biologist. He is descended from Charles Darwin via Charles\\'s son George Howard Darwin (1845-1912) a astronomer, his son William Robert Darwin (1894-1970), a stockbroker and brother of the physicist Charles Galton Darwin, and his wife Sarah Monica (née Slingsby) were the parents of George Erasmus Darwin (1927-).Ironically, given his famous ancestor, Darwin struggled with biology in his school years, failing the biology A-level. He later graduated from Oxford Polytechnic (latterly Oxford Brookes University) with a Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology and Geography. In 1983 he started London’s first bicycle rickshaw taxi service, and in 1984 was official photographer and assistant organiser for the first Round Britain Windsurf Expedition. The book Round Britain Windsurf by Tim Batstone, features Darwin\\'s photographs. He worked in advertising and television commercial production in the United Kingdom before emigrating to Australia in 1986.In 1991, he co-authored (with John Amy) the book The Social Climbers. In 1995, he co-edited (also with John Amy), The Ultimate Australian Adventure Guide. Darwin is married to Jacqui and has three children, Ali, Erasmus (Ras), and Monty. They live in the Blue Mountains west of Sydney, New South Wales, where Chris works in nature conservation. == Charitable work == Darwin co-authored (with John Amy) the book The Social Climbers. Written about a 1989 event in which Darwin and a group of seven other friends held a dinner party on top of Mount Huascaran in Peru, the book raised money for the National Heart Foundation. The dinner party itself set a world record for the \"highest formal dinner party on Earth.\"In 2003, Darwin made a donation to the Bush Heritage Australia charity to help purchase the Charles Darwin Reserve in Western Australia. The 65,000 hectare reserve is intended to preserve plant species. In 2009 he became an ambassador for Bush Heritage Australia. == Public appearances and opinions == In 2005 Chris, along with other descendants of Charles Darwin, including his father, sister, and various cousins, were involved in counting the flowers at Down House. He was also the guest of honour at a dinner celebrating the Darwin bicentenary at Melbourne Museum.Darwin believes that teaching children creationism is acceptable, despite his own lack of religious faith. He believes that it is \"important that children think through what is told to them and come to their own conclusions.\" == See also == Darwin–Wedgwood family == References ==',\n",
              " 'Dawn is a science fiction novel by American writer Dean McLaughlin. A re-imagining of Isaac Asimov\\'s 1941 short story \"Nightfall\", it was serialized in Analog magazine (April – July 1981), with two cover illustrations, for both its first and last segments. The story was republished in hardcover in 2006. == Plot == Dawn takes place on a nameless planet in a multiple-star system with six or seven stars, which are regarded as gods by the planet\\'s inhabitants. The planet orbits around Alpher, a yellow star similar to Earth\\'s sun, which forms a binary system with the smaller, cooler Bethe. The other four stars, Gamow, Dalton, Ephron, and Zwicky, are much farther away from Alpher and positioned in such a way that there is always at least one sun visible in the sky. The seventh \"god\" is the Pale One, which is either a large moon or a double planet. The orbits of the moon and stars are inclined enough that eclipses and occultations are rare events on the planet. Since there is always at least one sun in the sky, the planet never experiences darkness, except in enclosed spaces such as caves or windowless rooms. The movements of Alpher from east to west across the sky serve as the primary units of time, while longer periods are marked by seasonal shifts of Alpher\\'s position and the overtaking of one star by another. Hourglasses are used to measure shorter time intervals. Isak, the protagonist of the story, is a young scribe living in the city of Center, a feudal society that resembles the culture of medieval Europe. Despite his limited education as a scholar, he discovers that a pendulum can be used to accurately measure long periods of time, such as the time between sunrises. Through his travels and knowledge of this discovery, Isak develops the skills to measure the cycles of the suns and formulates a theory to explain them. Isak applies his theory to make accurate, long-term predictions of the movements of the \"gods.\" He discovers a remarkable event: Gamow will soon overtake the Pale One and pass directly behind it, blocking its light. The overtaking will last for more than half a cycle, resulting in a prolonged period of darkness for the entire world. Isak attempts to inform the priests of the Temple of Center of his prediction so that the people can prepare and avoid panic. However, both the people and the priests doubt Isak\\'s claims about the gods. The high priests fear that if the people were to believe Isak\\'s prediction, it would signal that the gods are angry with the priesthood and lead to societal unrest. As a result, they want to kill Isak before he can spread this foretelling. Isak seeks refuge in a merchant\\'s home and grows close to the merchant\\'s pregnant daughter who was attacked by the priests who disguised their actions as a religious rite. Isak learns about the corruption of the ruling theocracy and sees an opportunity to overthrow them when his foretelling comes to fruition. Members of a secret rebellion adopt Isak as their spokesperson, and as time passes, he gains more supporters. When the priests\\' guards come to take him captive, Isak\\'s followers abandon him. He is then subjected to torture and ordered to renounce his beliefs, but he refuses and is taken to the top of a tower to be further tortured in front of the people, serving as a warning to those who dare to oppose the temple priests. == Development history == McLaughlin pays homage to Asimov by naming the protagonist \"Isak\" and naming a historical figure Duke \"Lagash\", the name of the planet in \"Nightfall\". While Asimov simply used the Greek letters Alpha, Beta, Gamma, etc. to name the stars in his story, McLaughlin named his stars Alpher, Bethe, Gamow, Dalton, Ephron, and Zwicky. The first three are an allusion to the famous Alpha-Beta-Gamma paper written in 1948 by Ralph Alpher and George Gamow with Hans Bethe. Dalton and Zwicky are also famous scientists. == See also == Solar eclipses in fiction == References == Dawn title listing at the Internet Speculative Fiction Database',\n",

              " 'Charles Mallory Hatfield (July 15, 1875 – January 12, 1958) was an American \"rainmaker\". == Early life == Hatfield was born in Fort Scott, Kansas on July 15, 1875. His family moved to Southern California in the 1880s. As an adult, he became a salesman for the New Home Sewing Machine Company. In 1904, he moved to Glendale, California. == Career == In his free time Hatfield studied pluviculture and began to develop his own methods for producing rain. By 1902 he had created a secret mixture of 23 chemicals in large galvanized evaporating tanks that, he claimed, attracted rain. Hatfield called himself a \"moisture accelerator\".In 1904, promoter Fred Binney began a public relations campaign for Hatfield. A number of Los Angeles ranchers saw his ads in newspapers and promised Hatfield $50 to produce rain. In February, Hatfield and his brother Paul built an evaporating tower at La Crescenta where Hatfield released his mixture into the air. Hatfield\\'s attempt was apparently successful, so the ranchers paid him $100. Contemporary weather bureau reports described the rain as a small part of a storm that was already coming but Hatfield\\'s supporters disregarded this.: 81 Hatfield began to receive more job offers. He promised Los Angeles 18 inches (46 cm) of rain, apparently succeeded, and collected a fee of $1000.: 82–84 For this effort, Hatfield had built his tower on the grounds of the Esperanza Sanitarium in Altadena, near Rubio Canyon. In 1906 Hatfield was invited to the Yukon Territory, where he agreed to create rain for the water-dependent mines of the Klondike goldfields. The Klondike contract was for $10,000, but after unsuccessful efforts, Hatfield slipped away, collecting only $1,100 for expenses. This failure did not deter his supporters. In 1915 the San Diego city council, pressured by the San Diego Wide Awake Improvement Club, approached Hatfield to produce rain to fill the Morena Dam reservoir. Hatfield offered to produce rain for free, then charge $1,000 per inch ($393.7 per centimetre) for between forty and fifty inches (1.02 to 1.27 m) and free again over fifty inches (1.27 m). The council voted four to one for a $10,000 fee, payable when the reservoir was filled. A formal agreement was never drawn up, though Hatfield continued based on verbal understanding. Hatfield, with his brother, built a tower beside Lake Morena and was ready early in the New Year.: 91 On January 5, 1916 heavy rain began—and grew gradually heavier day by day. Dry riverbeds filled to the point of flooding. Worsening floods destroyed bridges, marooned trains and cut phone cables - not to mention flooding homes and farms. Two dams, Sweetwater Dam and one at Lower Otay Lake, overflowed. Rain stopped on 20 January but resumed two days later. On January 27 Lower Otay Dam broke, increasing the devastation and reportedly causing about 20 deaths (accounts vary on the exact number).Hatfield talked to the press on February 4 and said that the damage was not his fault and that the city should have taken adequate precautions. Hatfield had fulfilled the requirements of his contract—filling the reservoir—but the city council refused to pay the money unless Hatfield would accept liability for damages; there were already claims worth $3.5 million. Besides, there was no written contract. Hatfield tried to settle for $4000 and then sued the council. The suit continued until 1938 when two courts decided that the rain was an act of God, which absolved him of any wrongdoing, but also meant Hatfield did not get his fee.Hatfield\\'s fame only grew and he received more contracts for rainmaking. Among other things, in 1929 he tried to stop a forest fire in Honduras. Later the Bear Valley Mutual Water Company wanted to fill Big Bear Lake. However, during the Great Depression he had to return to his work as a sewing machine salesman. His wife divorced him. Charles Hatfield died January 12, 1958 and took his chemical formula with him to his grave in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. Hatfield claimed at least 500 successes. According to later commentators, Hatfield\\'s successes were mainly due to his meteorological skill and sense of timing, selecting periods where there was a high probability of rain anyway. == References in popular culture == Charles Hatfield and the 1916 flooding at Lake Morena is the subject of the song \"Hatfield\" by the band Widespread Panic. Singer/guitarist John Bell wrote the song after reading the story of the rainmaker in a Farmers\\' Almanac. The song was released on the album Everyday in 1993. Hatfield\\'s story inspired the 1956 Burt Lancaster film The Rainmaker, based on the play of the same name. Hollywood invited Hatfield to the premiere. The play also became the basis of a Broadway Musical, 110 in the Shade. Charles Hatfield\\'s fictional great-great-granddaughter has taken up his research in T.

              " 'Princess Harbour is a community in the Canadian province of Manitoba. The village is on a small peninsula on the east shore of Lake Winnipeg. The community was originally named Rabbit Point and is still referred to as such by locals. Recognized as a community by the Province of Manitoba in 1972 under the Northern Affairs Act, the settlement does not have a political leader but rather it is represented by someone who is called a \"contact person\".The Hudson Bay Company had a house at Rabbit Point through the mid to late 1800s. It was used as a place to stay while traveling through, but there are no records it was used for trading. The first mention of settler presence in the area began in 1890, and funeral and baptism records note the names of local families from then until present day. A store was built in the small settlement in 1934 and as the little community grew a school followed in 1939. The school changed its name from Princess Harbour School to the Dolly Magnusson School in 1982, the small school would eventually close in 1982. A coal oil fueled harbour light was maintained by the community as regulated by the government at the time. == Etymology == Though it is not known why the community was named Princess Harbour, local history books believe that the name is attributed to the SS Princess that sailed Lake Winnipeg at the turn of the 20th century. The name was not officially changed to Princess Harbour until 1952, when the community got its own post office. It\\'s noted the change of name came as a result of confusion with another location named Rabbit Point or Rabbit Lake somewhere in Manitoba. == Demographics == In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Princess Harbour had a population of 0 living in 0 of its 0 total private dwellings, a change of -100% from its 2016 population of 5.

              " 'Maddalena Cerasuolo, also known as Lenuccia (Naples, 2 February 1920 – Naples, 23 October 1999), was an Italian patriot and antifascist partisan.She is remembered especially for having actively participated with a significant role in the revolt against the Nazi army that occurred in Naples from 27 to 30 September 1943, which is remembered as the Four days of Naples. == Biography == The life of Maddalena, as well as that of many of her peers, was split in two parts by World War II. Nevertheless, the war allowed her to stand out in the ranks of the Resistenza and as a secret agent, working with the United Kingdom. After the war, she continued to live in Naples, until her death in 1999, after having married with surname Morgese and having two children, Gaetana and Gennaro. === Early years === Maddalena\\'s parents belonged to the working class; she was the daughter of Annunziata Capuozzo and Carlo Cerasuolo, who lived in the Stella neighborhood in Naples together with her other five sisters Titina, Maria, Anna, Dora, Rosaria and two brothers Giovanni and Vincenzo.The father, Carlo, who was working as cook, in the 1910s participated in the Italo-Turkish War and also later in the Resistenza when he was registered and imprisoned several times for acts of resistance against Fascism. During World War II, he was initially employed by the company Ansaldo to manage the canteen. Later he was unemployed, thereby he put up an itinerant stall where he prepared and sold fried pizzas.The mother, Annunziata, was employed as help-cook at Ansaldo too, following her husband. Later she helped him in his new activity.When the war was breaking out, Maddalena was about 20 years old, working as craftswoman at a small shoe factory. === Entering the Resistenza === During the war, Maddalena stood out when she participated in the gunfights that happened in the Materdei neighborhood, to avoid the German troops plundering the shoe factory near to vico delle Trone, in exchange for the weapons delivery. She volunteered to go alone on the prowl to calculate the size of the German troops and later to speak with Nazi officials, with the risk of not having enshrined Geneva Convention rights as ambassador. Maddalena Cerasuolo participated in the battle against the German troops by defending the Ponte della Sanità with the partisans of the neighborhoods Materdei and Stella, led by her father Carlo Cerasuolo, lieutenant Dino Del Prete and firefighter officer Vinicio Giacomelli. They contributed to keeping open an important entranceway to the city, and also an important branch of the aqueduct that supplied the center of Naples.For this episode she received a Medal of Military Valor and she was invited to the Royal Palace by General Montgomery, who hugged and kissed her. === Collaboration with UK secret services === Maddalena Cerasuolo, with her alias \"Maria Esposito\", agent number \"C22\", from 23 October 1943 to 8 February 1944, operated with the Special Operations Executive (SOE), which is the British secret service. After a short training at Castello Mezzatorre in Forio di Ischia, she participated in the missions named \"Hillside II\" and \"Kelvin\". The Hillside II mission consisted of passing beyond enemy lines, but it ended with three failed attempts.Kelvin was a maritime mission. Cerasuolo used a motor torpedo boat directed to Corsica, to get to the coast of Liguria from Bastia, to sabotage military sites by using weapons and explosives, as planned by the British strategy. Also this mission ended with a failure, five attempts without any landing. Moreover, Maddalena lost all her clothes that she had with herself, and was later reimbursed by the SOE.Still working with the SOE, Maddalena parachuted beyond the enemy lines when in Italy they were marked from Rome to Montecassino, to collect information by pretending to be the maid of the artist Anna d\\'Andria, who was collaborating by giving high society parties to understand the strategy of the German army.In the personal file of the SOE Maddalena is recorded as housewife, not married, living in vico della Neve, 23, Materdei, Naples at Carlo Cerasuolo\\'s house, active as special agent from 21 October 1943 to 8 February 1944 – even though she was still available to continue – with the following service notes: Subject took a conspicuous part in Naples insurrection. She help[ed] build barricades and took part in the fighting with rifle and hand grenades. She was discharged on 8 Feb. 1944 and paid up to date 7,500 lire for clothing lost. She received no bonus or certificate of service. == Recognition == Cerasuolo received several recognitions, both during her life, such as the Medal of Military Valor and other prestigious acknowledgements, and after her death, among those a toponymical dedication in the city of Naples. === Military recognitions === On 24 May 1946 she was honored with the Bronze Medal of Military Valor with the following citation: After speaking as speaker with the Germans in Vico delle Trone, she stood out in the following battle. In the same day, she participated [in] the fight in defense of the bridge Ponte della Sanità, next to her father and the partisans of Materdei e Stella neighborhoods.The collaboration with the SOE was recognized, besides with economic reimbursement, also with the following acknowledgement:For her proud behavior and for the contribution to the cause of liberty, in the name of this Command, I tribute her a praise and I thank her. === Civilian recognitions === Once the war ended, she received a certificate of merit signed by officer H.S. Carruthers, by the British kingdom.The year after her death, on 3 March 2000, the mayor Rosa Russo Iervolino inaugurated a commemorative plaque for Maddalena Cerasuolo, placed by Comune di Napoli and Istituto Campano per la Storia della Resistenza. === Popular culture === Maddalena Cerasuolo\\'s memory is held in the culture of the city of Naples, since she is quoted in several texts about the Resistenza and the Four days of Naples. Sometimes her story is brought up also in support of the thesis that Neapolitan resistance was not led by spontaneous riots, as is largely believed, but as the result of activity organized locally, within an internationally agreed strategy. ==== Books ==== In 2014, her daughter Gaetana Morgese published a book dedicated to her biography.She is quoted in several Italian books, such as the romance Il paradiso dei diavoli by Franco di Mare, 2013, in Le donne erediteranno la terra and in Possa il mio sangue servire by Aldo Cazzullo, 2016 and finally in Il treno dei bambini by Viola Ardone. ==== Music ==== In 1995, Carlo Faiello wrote lyrics and music of a song dedicated to Maddalena Cerasuolo, entitled \"Maddalena\", which was interpreted by several artists such as: Nuova Compagnia di Canto Popolare (1995) Lina Sastri (2000) Anna Maria Castelli (2010) Neapolis in fabula (2011) Paola Subrizi Quartet (2018) == See also == Four days of Naples Italian resistance movement Special Operations Executive (SOE) History of women in the Italian Resistance == References == == Bibliography == Gaetana Morgese (2010).

Smirnov was born in a family of clerical employees. His mother was imprisoned in 1937 for anti-Soviet activity and, as later revealed, was executed by gun shot. While studying at school, Yuri M. Smirnov was interested in mathematics and astronomy and after completing undergraduate study in 1939 entered the astronomy department of the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics of Moscow State University. However, soon under the influence of A. N. Kolmogorov, he transferred to the mathematical department of the same Faculty.After his second year of undergraduate study, Smirnov went in autumn 1941 to the front and served as a radio operator in the Northern Fleet until the end of WW II. After demobilization in 1945, he continued his studies at the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics of Moscow State University and began to participate in the seminars of the famous topologist P. S. Alexandrov. In 1948 Smirnov graduated from the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics and entered the graduate school of the same faculty, at the same time starting to work as a junior researcher at the Steklov Institute of Mathematics. In 1951 he defended his Ph.D. (Russian Candidate of Sciences) thesis О топологических пространствах, компактных в данном отрезке мощностей (On topological spaces, compact in a given interval of cardinalities), which was supervised by P. S. Alexandrov. In 1957 Smirnov received his Russian Doctor of Sciences degree with thesis Исследование по общей и равномерной топологии методом покрытий (Investigation of general and uniform topology by the covering method).From 1945 until the end of his life he worked at the Department of Higher Geometry and Topology of the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics of Moscow State University, from 1953 as an associate professor, and from 1958 as a full professor. He taught courses on analytical geometry, linear algebra and topology, linear algebra and geometry, differential geometry and topology, and the theories of retracts, shapes, and equivariant compactifications.Smirnov published over a hundred scientific papers, most of which are related to general topology. He is the author of fundamental results on the problem of metrization of topological spaces and in equivariant topology, as well as in dimension theory and in the theories of shapes, retracts, and proximity spaces. His name is associated with the famous Nagata-Smirnov metrization theorem (proved independently by the Japanese mathematician Jun-iti Nagata). The theorem gives necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a metric generating the original topology. Smirnov gave lectures not only in Russia, but also in Germany, Poland, Bulgaria, Georgia, Armenia, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan. He supervised 12 Russian Doctor of Sciences (habilitation) degrees and more than 35 Candidate of Sciences degrees (PhDs). He was awarded the Order of the Patriotic War for his WW II service. In 1962 he was an Invited Speaker with talk Некоторые вопросы равномерной топологии (Some questions of uniform topology) at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Stockholm. He was awarded honorary titles: Honored Professor of Moscow State University (1996), Honored Scientist of the USSR (1981), and Honored Scientist of the Russian Federation (2002). In 1995 he received the Wacław Sierpiński Medal jointly from the Polish Academy of Sciences and the University of Warsaw. == References == == External links == Летопись Московского университета (Annals of Moscow University) Страница Ю.

              " 'In usage in the Southern United States, a bayou () is a body of water typically found in a flat, low-lying area. It may refer to an extremely slow-moving stream, river (often with a poorly defined shoreline), marshy lake, wetland, or creek. They typically contain brackish water highly conducive to fish life and plankton. Bayous are commonly found in the Gulf Coast region of the southern United States, especially in the Mississippi River Delta, though they also exist elsewhere. A bayou is often an anabranch or minor braid of a braided channel that is slower than the mainstem, often becoming boggy and stagnant. Though fauna varies by region, many bayous are home to crawfish, certain species of shrimp, other shellfish, catfish, frogs, toads, salamanders, newts, American alligators, American crocodiles, herons, lizards, turtles, tortoises, spoonbills, snakes, and leeches, as well as many other species. == Etymology == The word entered American English via Louisiana French in Louisiana and is thought to originate from the Choctaw word bayuk, which means \"small stream\". After first appearing in the 17th century, the term is found in 18th century accounts and maps, often as bayouc or bayouque, where it was eventually shortened to its current form. The first settlements of the Bayou Têche and other bayous were founded by the Louisiana Creoles, and the bayous are commonly associated with Creole and Cajun culture. An alternative spelling, \"buyou\", is also known to have been in use, as in \"Pine Buyou\", used in a description by Congress in 1833 of Arkansas Territory. == Geography == The term Bayou Country is most closely associated with Cajun and Creole cultural groups derived from French settlers and stretching along the Gulf Coast from Houston, Texas, to Mobile, Alabama, and picking back up in South Florida around the Everglades, with its center in New Orleans, Louisiana. The term may also be associated with the homelands of certain Choctaw tribal groups.Houston has the nickname \"Bayou City\". As of 2016 \"bye-you\" US: is the most common pronunciation, while a few use \"bye-oh\" US: , although that pronunciation is declining. == Environmental Risks == Bayous are susceptible to pollution such as runoff from nearby urban communities (which can result in eutrophication) and oil spills. Many bayous have been cleared away by human activity as well (with those in Louisiana having shrunk by 4,900 square kilometers since the 1930s). == Notable examples == Bayou Bartholomew Bayou Corne Bayou La Batre Bayou Lafourche Bayou St. John Bayou Teche Big Bayou Canot Buffalo Bayou Cypress Bayou == See also == Backswamp – Environment on a floodplain where deposits settle after a flood Billabong – Australian term for a seasonal oxbow lake Hurricane on the Bayou – 2006 documentary film by Greg MacGillivray Oxbow lake – U-shaped lake or pool Yazoo stream – Hydrologic term Bayeux – Subprefecture and commune in Normandy, France == References == == External links ==',\n",

Sculpted by the Royal Sculptor Philip Jackson, it is Jackson\\'s second piece featuring Moore, after the World Cup Sculpture unveiled in 2003. == Statue == The work, titled The Bobby Moore Sculpture by Jackson, is a twice life size, tall bronze piece and stands at 20 feet (6.1 m) including the plinth. It is located at the end of Wembley Way and weighs around two tons. It was placed in a highly prominent position, on a plinth on the north side of the stadium, with Moore looking north along Wembley Way, which forms the main pedestrian approach to the stadium, where it can look over arriving fans.In addition to the statue, the work features on the front of its stone plinth a plaque which depicts the rest of the 1966 England team, while similarly on the side is mounted a sculpture of an England cap, with \"World Championship, Jules Rimet Cup, 1970\" written on the peak. The work also features an inscription composed by Jeff Powell, a football journalist and one of Moore\\'s closest friends. It reads: Immaculate footballer. Imperial defender. Immortal hero of 1966. First Englishman to raise the World Cup aloft. Favourite son of London\\'s East End. Finest legend of West Ham United. National Treasure. Master of Wembley. Lord of the game. Captain extraordinary. Gentleman of all time. == Inspiration == The subject of the statue is the English footballer Bobby Moore OBE (1941–1993). Moore, who died of cancer aged 51, was the captain of West Ham United and England team, and had led England to victory at the 1966 World Cup at old Wembley. The statue is a tribute to Moore\\'s unique achievement of being a World Cup winning England captain, and was commissioned in response to a Football Association fan poll to find the greatest England player of the last 50 years, won \"hands down\" by Moore.Jackson sought to create a sculpture that \"captures the qualities associated with Bobby Moore, namely integrity, loyalty, leadership, popularity and humility but above all as the greatest-ever English footballer.\" Jackson consulted with a specially formed panel to agree the design, formed from Moore\\'s widow Stephanie, Moore\\'s fellow footballers and friends Sir Bobby Charlton, Sir Geoff Hurst and Sir Trevor Brooking, the FA and WNSL chiefs Brian Barwick and Michael Cunnah, the Royal British Society of Sculptors President Brian Falconbridge, and architect Lord Foster, as well as fan representative Gavin Morton-Holmes. On unveiling, Jackson said \"What emerged [from the design consultation] was he was this extraordinary presence in the team, which gave this enormous confidence and allowed the team to sort of win through in \\'66 and so I created the sculpture in this sort of old fashioned heroic style.\" == History == === Commissioning === Wembley National Stadium Ltd (WNSL) announced it was commissioning the statue in September 2005, while the new Wembley was being built, replacing the Old Wembley. According to Paul Kelso of The Guardian, the statue was the Football Association\\'s first official tribute to Moore.Jackson was selected from a short-list to produce the statue. It was the second time Jackson had produced a sculpture of Moore, having completed The Champions sculpture situated near West Ham\\'s stadium, the Boleyn Ground, unveiled in 2003 by Prince Andrew, Duke of York, and features Moore held aloft on the shoulders of other players, himself holding the World Cup trophy aloft. === Production === Preview images of the clay mould for the sculpture were released in January 2006, while Stephanie Moore visited the studio to see the work in progress. Modelled in clay, the sculpture was then moulded in hard plaster and then sand, to facilitate casting in bronze, with the cast statue finished by patination for the final colour.Jackson created eight casts of Moore\\'s right foot for the sculpture, one of which was auctioned on 31 May 2006 at Christie\\'s in aid of Moore\\'s cancer charity. === Unveiling === The statue was unveiled on 11 May 2007 by Sir Bobby Charlton, with guests including Moore\\'s widow Stephanie, Prime Minister Tony Blair and Sir Geoff Hurst. The statue was the \"finishing touch\" to the completion of the new Wembley, which officially opened after several delays, on 19 May, with the staging of the 2007 FA Cup Final. WNSL originally intended to unveil it in 2006, on the 40th anniversary of the World Cup win, with the new stadium having originally been due to open in time for the May 2006 FA Cup Final. == Reception == The statue, along with the signature steel arch, are described by Paul Hayward of The Guardian as the \"inspiring architectural flourishes\" of the stadium. Henry Winter of The Daily Telegraph, writing in 2009, described how the statue \"captures Moore\\'s dignity\", and is the place where everyone on their way into Wembley pauses for a moment to admire \"this magnificent likeness of the most important figure in the history of English sport and [give] thanks for 1966\".Moore\\'s widow said of the completed statue, \"Philip has done an incredible job of capturing Bobby – both in terms of his qualities as a player and his physical appearance.\" == Gallery == == See also == List of public art in Brent == References ==',\n",
              " '\"Night Time Is the Right Time\" or \"The Right Time\" is a rhythm and blues song recorded by American musician Nappy Brown in 1957. It draws on earlier blues songs and has inspired popular versions, including those by Ray Charles, Rufus and Carla, and James Brown, which reached the record charts. == Earlier songs == Blues pianist Roosevelt Sykes (listed as \"the Honey Dripper\") recorded \"Night Time Is the Right Time\" in 1937. Called \"one of his \\'hits\\' of the day\", it is a moderate-tempo twelve-bar blues that features Sykes on vocal and piano. It has been suggested that it was \"drawn from the old vaudeville tradition\": In 1938, Big Bill Broonzy recorded the song, as \"Night Time Is the Right Time No. 2,\" with slightly different (and more suggestive) lyrics. The same year, Roosevelt Sykes recorded a new version, similarly entitled \"Night Time Is the Right Time #2,\" also with slightly different lyrics. These earliest recordings of \"Night Time Is the Right Time\" are credited to Roosevelt Sykes and Leroy Carr. Carr died in 1935 without any known recordings of the song; \"Night Time Is The Right Time\" bears similarity to Carr\\'s \"When The Sun Goes Down\". == Nappy Brown song == In 1957, Nappy Brown recorded the song as \"The Right Time\". Called \"a highlight of Brown\\'s early career\", his version features additional lyrics with background singers answering his vocal lines. The instrumental accompaniment is provided by Buster Cooper on trombone, Hilton Jefferson on alto sax, Budd Johnson on tenor sax, Kelly Owens on piano, Skeeter Best on guitar, Leonard Gaskin on bass, and Bobby Donaldson on drums. Brown\\'s song opens with Brown\\'s version did not reach the national record charts, but was \"borrowed by Ray Charles in short order\". During his career, Brown recorded several versions of the song (sometimes varying the title). His original single lists the songwriter as \"N. Brown\". == Ray Charles version == Ray Charles recorded his version, titled \"(Night Time Is) The Right Time\", on October 28, 1958, at the Atlantic Records studio in New York City. According to Brown, \"The difference between me and Ray Charles\\'s ‘Night Time Is the Right Time\\' ... is he had it up-tempo with Mary Ann and them behind him—the ladies. I had mine in a slow tempo with a gospel group behind me. That was my gospel group. But he got everything just like mine, note for note\". Margie Hendrix with Charles\\' backup singers the Raelettes provided the accompaniment to Charles\\' vocals. Released as a single, it reached number five on the Billboard R&B chart and number 95 on its Hot 100 chart in 1959. The songwriters were listed as \"Brown-Cadena-Herman\" on the single and the albums Ray Charles in Person (1960) and The Genius Sings the Blues (1961); however, some later anthologies only list Lew Herman, also known as Herman Lubinsky, who was the owner of Nappy Brown\\'s record label. The song is also included on Ray Charles at Newport (1958) and the film soundtrack of Ray (2004). In the second season episode of The Cosby Show \"Happy Anniversary\", the Huxtable family lip-syncs to Ray Charles\\' version. CNN\\'s Lisa Respers France stated \"No \\'Cosby Show\\' list is complete without this family performance... Keshia Knight Pulliam stole our hearts as little Rudy Huxtable in this scene.\" while Vulture called it The Cosby Show\\'s best musical moment. In 1997, TV Guide ranked this episode number 54 on its \\'100 Greatest Episodes of All Time\\' list. == James Brown version == James Brown recorded the song for the small Churchill/Augusta record label. It was released in 1983 as the B-side of his single \"Bring It On...Bring It On\". Brown\\'s version (subtitled \"To be With the One That You Love\") went on to reach number 73 in the Billboard R&B chart. Robert Christgau reviewed Brown\\'s version favorably, singling out for praise the contribution of its unidentified female guest vocalist, \"a Brownette who approaches any kind of note as if she owns it.\" == References ==',\n",
              " 'Aalaap Raju (born 6 June 1979) is a playback singer and a bass guitar player from Chennai, India. His rendition of Enamo Aedho from the movie Ko composed by Harris Jayaraj topped the music charts for several months in 2011 and won him the Filmfare Award for Best Male Playback Singer – 2011. He has sung for music directors like Harris Jayaraj, Thaman, G.V Prakash, Deepak Dev, D.Imman, Sreekanth Deva and many more. His other noticeable songs include Vaaya moodi summa iru da from Mugamoodi, Engeyum Kadhal from Engeyum Kadhal, Endhan Kann Munnae from Nanban, Kadhal Oru Butterfly and Akila Akila from Oru Kal Oru Kannadi, Anjana Anjana from Vandhan Vendran, Kuthu Kuthu from Ayyanar, Nenjodu Cherthu from Yuvvh, Theeyae Theeyae from Maattrraan, Jal Jal Osai from Manam Kothi Paravai, and Maya Bazaar from Ennai Arindhaal. He is also a well-known bass guitar player, have collaborated for all top composers in Kollywood, Mollywood and all the way to Bollywood. His noticeable Bollywood collaboration was with Shankar–Ehsaan–Loy for the movie Raazi He had played bass guitar for the only track in the album called ‘Dilbaro’ . He has played more than 500 Live gigs including commercial film, fusion and TV shows. == Early life == Music was something that was natural to him since he hails from a musical family. His parents, J. M. Raju and Latha Raju, are playback singers in Malayalam while his grandmother, late Smt. Santha P. Nair and grandfather, late K. Padmanabhan Nair were well known names in the Malayalam music industry in 60s and 70s. Though in his school days he wanted to become a professional cricketer and represent India in the International level, his under graduation days at SVCE (Chennai) had other plans for him. His college mates inspired him to take up singing and bass guitar in parallel in his last year. Months of practice made Aalaap a self-taught musician in playing bass guitar and singing, Aalaap\\'s name spread through the most prestigious cultural events in India especially \\'Saarang\\' (hosted by Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Chennai) where he was awarded \\'Best Instrumentalist\\' for his bass guitar playing. And that was the starting point of numerous recording sessions and live performances in India and abroad. His singing took more prominence once Ennamo Yedho and Engeyum Kadhal released in 2011, composed by Harris Jayaraj. Aalaap now concentrates on singing and bass guitar playing equally in studios and live. == Career == As a singer and bass guitar player, Aalaap has performed with several prominent artists such as Dr. T.V. Gopalakrishnan, Dr. L. Subramaniam, Frank Dubier, etc., and has recorded with noticeable composers such as Ilayaraja, Harris Jayaraj, Shankar Ehsaan Loy, Mani Sarma, G.V Prakash, Thaman, Deepak Dev etc. He has been part of the prestigious Europalia Festival \\'13 (hosted by ICCR India: Indian Council for Cultural Relations), as a bass guitar player for Dr. L. Subramaniam covering countries like Italy, Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Russia, Sweden, Latvia and Iceland. Aalaap was part of a Neo-Carnatic-Funk band called Project YUJ, a four piece line up composed of electric mandolin, electric bass guitar, keyboards and acoustic drums. Yuj, a Sanskrit word that means to join or to concentrate, is indicative of the group\\'s manifesto – to bring out and fuse its multitude of influences into a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. The group members\\' diverse musical backgrounds and formidable chops allow for flights of improvisational freedom and virtuosity while still maintaining accessibility and musicality. At present, there are not many groups in India that are really trying to improvise and authentically fuse all of these disparate styles while staying true to the vital aspects of each. Project YUJ fills that space! He was also part of a duo multi-genre band called Rahlaap along with playback singer Rahul Nambiar. Rahlaap has released their self-titled multi-genre album. Available in music portals like iTunes, Amazon, Hummaa, etc. Aalaap is now an active member of bands like MAKKA (feat. Playback singers Ranjith Govind and Rahul Nambiar), his own line up called Aalaap Raju & Band (ArB) and Sean Roldan & Friends. == Awards == Filmfare Award for Best Male Playback Singer - Tamil – \"Enamo Aedho\" for Ko Edison Award for Best Male Playback Singer – \"Enamo Aedho\" for Ko Vijay Award for Song of the Year (for Enamo Aedho) – 2011 Radio Mirchi Award for Song of the Year (for Enamo Aedho) – 2011 Edison Award for Best Singer – 2011 Chennai Times Award for Best Singer – 2011 Screen Moon Award for Best Singer – 2011 Kannadasan Award for Best Debutant Singer – 2011 Big FM Rising Star Award for Best Singer – 2011 Jaya Award for Best Debutant Singer – 2011 V4 Shivaji – MGR Award for Best Singer – 2011 Big FM Best Melody Singer Award – Tamil – 2013 Big FM Best Melody Singer Award (Independent Music) – Malayalam – 2013 == Discography == == References == == External links == Gurupriya S (29 January 2011). \"Aalaap Raju: Double delight\".

              " 'Histamine H3 receptors are expressed in the central nervous system and to a lesser extent the peripheral nervous system, where they act as autoreceptors in presynaptic histaminergic neurons and control histamine turnover by feedback inhibition of histamine synthesis and release. The H3 receptor has also been shown to presynaptically inhibit the release of a number of other neurotransmitters (i.e. it acts as an inhibitory heteroreceptor) including, but probably not limited to dopamine, GABA, acetylcholine, noradrenaline, histamine and serotonin. The gene sequence for H3 receptors expresses only about 22% and 20% homology with both H1 and H2 receptors respectively. There is much interest in the histamine H3 receptor as a potential therapeutic target because of its involvement in the neuronal mechanism behind many cognitive disorders and especially its location in the central nervous system. == Tissue distribution == Central nervous system Peripheral nervous system Heart Lungs Gastrointestinal tract Endothelial cells == Function == Like all histamine receptors, the H3 receptor is a G-protein coupled receptor. The H3 receptor is coupled to the Gi G-protein, so it leads to inhibition of the formation of cAMP. Also, the β and γ subunits interact with N-type voltage gated calcium channels, to reduce action potential mediated influx of calcium and hence reduce neurotransmitter release. H3 receptors function as presynaptic autoreceptors on histamine-containing neurons.The diverse expression of H3 receptors throughout the cortex and subcortex indicates its ability to modulate the release of a large number of neurotransmitters. H3 receptors are thought to play a part in the control of satiety. == Isoforms == There are at least six H3 receptor isoforms in the human, and more than 20 discovered so far. In rats there have been six H3receptor subtypes identified so far. Mice also have three reported isoforms. These subtypes all have subtle difference in their pharmacology (and presumably distribution, based on studies in rats) but the exact physiological role of these isoforms is still unclear. == Pharmacology == === Agonists === There are currently no therapeutic products acting as selective agonists for H3 receptors, although there are several compounds used as research tools which are reasonably selective agonists. Some examples are: (R)-α-methylhistamine Cipralisant (initially assessed as H3 antagonist, later found to be an agonist, shows functional selectivity, activating some G-protein coupled pathways but not others) Imbutamine (also H4 agonist) Immepip Imetit Immethridine Methimepip Proxyfan (complex functional selectivity; partial agonist effects on cAMP inhibition and MAPK activity, antagonist on histamine release, and inverse agonist on arachidonic acid release) === Antagonists === These include: A-304121 (No tolerance formation, silent antagonist) A-349,821 ABT-239 Betahistine (also weak H1 agonist) Burimamide (also weak H2 antagonist) Ciproxifan Clobenpropit (also H4 antagonist) Conessine Failproxifan (No tolerance formation) Impentamine Iodophenpropit Irdabisant Pitolisant Thioperamide (also H4 antagonist) VUF-5681 (4-[3-(1H-Imidazol-4-yl)propyl]piperidine) == Therapeutic potential == The H3-receptor is a promising potential therapeutical target for many (cognitive) disorders that are caused by a histaminergic H3R dysfunction, because it is linked to the central nervous system and its regulation of other neurotransmitters. Examples of such disorders are: sleep disorders (including narcolepsy), Tourette syndrome, Parkinson, OCD, ADHD, ASS and drug addictions.This receptor has been proposed as a target for treating sleep disorders. The receptor has also been proposed as a target for treating neuropathic pain.Because of its ability to modulate other neurotransmitters, H3 receptor ligands are being investigated for the treatment of numerous neurological conditions, including obesity (because of the histamine/orexinergic system interaction), movement disorders (because of H3 receptor-modulation of dopamine and GABA in the basal ganglia), schizophrenia and ADHD (again because of dopamine modulation) and research is underway to determine whether H3 receptor ligands could be useful in modulating wakefulness (because of effects on noradrenaline, glutamate and histamine).There is also evidence that the H3-receptor plays an important role in Tourette syndrome. Mouse-models and other research demonstrated that reducing histamine concentration in the H3R causes tics, but adding histamine in the striatum decreases the symptoms. The interaction between histamine (H3-receptor) and dopamine as well as other neurotransmitters is an important underlying mechanism behind the disorder. == History == 1983 The H3 receptor is pharmacologically identified. 1988 H3 receptor found to mediate inhibition of serotonin release in rat brain cortex. 1997 H3 receptors shown to modulate ischemic norepinephrine release in animals. 1999 H3 receptor cloned 2000 H3 receptors called \"new frontier in myocardial ischemia\" 2002 H3(-/-) mice (mice that do not have this receptor) == See also == Antihistamine – histamine receptor antagonists H3-receptor antagonist Histamine H1-receptor Histamine H2-receptor Histamine H4-receptor == References == == Further reading == == External links == \"Histamine Receptors: H3\".

              " 'The 110th Boat Race took place on 28 March 1964. Held annually, the event is a side-by-side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames. The Oxford crew was the heaviest in Boat Race history. The race was won by Cambridge by six-and-half lengths. Cambridge won the Women\\'s Boat Race. == Background == The Boat Race is a side-by-side rowing competition between the University of Oxford (sometimes referred to as the \"Dark Blues\") and the University of Cambridge (sometimes referred to as the \"Light Blues\"). The race was first held in 1829, and since 1845 has taken place on the 4.2-mile (6.8 km) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London. The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities, followed throughout the United Kingdom and broadcast worldwide. Oxford went into the race as reigning champions, having won the previous year\\'s race by five lengths, while Cambridge led overall in the event with 60 victories to Oxford\\'s 48 (excluding the \"dead heat\" of 1877).The first Women\\'s Boat Race took place in 1927, but did not become an annual fixture until the 1960s. Up until 2014, the contest was conducted as part of the Henley Boat Races, but as of the 2015 race, it is held on the River Thames, on the same day as the men\\'s main and reserve races. This year\\'s women\\'s race was the first to be held since 1952. Writing in the Financial Times, Joseph Mallalieu noted that the Boat Race was subsidised by The Varsity Match every year. Despite Oxford being \"firm favourites\" upon their arrival at the Tideway, Cambridge put in better performances in training, and by the time of the race were considered the favourites themselves. The main race was umpired for the eighth and final time by the former Olympian Kenneth Payne who had rowed for Cambridge in the 1932 and 1934 races. == Crews == Although it was the heaviest Cambridge crew ever, they weighed an average of 13 st 4.75 lb (84.5 kg), almost 3 pounds (1.4 kg) per rower less than Oxford, who were the heaviest crew in Boat Race history. Oxford saw two former Blues return in Miles Morland and Duncan Spencer, while Cambridge\\'s crew included four Boat Race veterans in Donald Legget, Mike Bevan, John Lecky and Christopher Davey. Lecky was a Canadian international rower who had won a silver medal in the men\\'s eight at the 1960 Summer Olympics. Six of Oxford\\'s crew came from Keble College, five of those schooled at Eton College. == Race == Cambridge won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station, handing the Middlesex side of the river to Oxford. With a \"calm, following wind\", the race commenced at 2.20 p.m., and within a minute, Cambridge had a quarter-length lead before Oxford closed the gap at Craven Cottage. The Light Blues reached the Mile Post three seconds ahead and crossed over to the midstream. By Harrods Furniture Depository they had extended their lead out to two lengths and passed below Hammersmith Bridge a further half-length ahead. Despite a surge from Oxford, Cambridge were sixteen seconds ahead at Chiswick Steps and increased the gap to twenty seconds by Barnes Bridge. Cambridge won by 6+1⁄2 lengths in a time of 19 minutes 18 seconds, 23 seconds ahead of Oxford.The victory was Cambridge\\'s 61st in the contest, taking the overall score to 61–48. The Cambridge boat club president and stroke Christopher Davey said: \"Everything went as planned, but Oxford hung on more than I would have liked at the end. I would have liked to have taken it to 10 lengths if possible but Oxford kept going splendidly at the end.\"In the 20th running of the Women\\'s Boat Race, Cambridge triumphed, their third consecutive victory. == References == Notes Bibliography Burnell, Richard (1979).

              " 'John Walter Lord Jr. (October 8, 1917 – May 19, 2002) was an American author, lawyer, copywriter and popular historian best known for his 1955 account of the sinking of the RMS Titanic, A Night to Remember. == Biography == === Early life === Lord was born in Baltimore, Maryland to John Walter Lord Sr. and Henrietta MacTier (Hoffman) Lord on October 8, 1917. His father, who was a lawyer, died when Lord was just three years old. Lord\\'s grandfather, Richard Curzon Hoffman, was president of the Baltimore Steam Packet Company (\"Old Bay Line\") steamship firm in the 1890s.In July 1925, at the age of 7, Lord traveled across the Atlantic Ocean with his mother and sister, from New York to Cherbourg and Southampton, on the RMS Olympic, the Titanic\\'s sister ship. Like many other boys who attended high school at Baltimore\\'s Gilman School, he spent his summers at Hyde Bay Camp for Boys at Hyde Bay in Cooperstown, New York, where he was awarded the honorary title of \"The Commodore\" and later returned to reign over many annual camp events, like the eight inch regatta and closing barbecue and bonfire. He then studied history at Princeton University and graduated in 1939. Lord then enrolled at Yale Law School, interrupting his studies to join the United States Army after the attack on Pearl Harbor. During World War II, he was assigned to the Office of Strategic Services as a code clerk in London, in 1942. He was the agency\\'s secretariat when the war ended in 1945. Afterwards, Lord returned to Yale, where he earned a degree in law. === Career === Lord wrote, or edited and annotated 11 bestselling books on such diverse subjects as the Attack on Pearl Harbor (Day of Infamy, 1957), the Battle of Midway (Incredible Victory, 1967), the Battle of the Alamo (A Time to Stand, 1961), the Battle of Baltimore (The Dawn\\'s Early Light, 1972), Arctic exploration (Peary to the Pole, 1963), pre-World War I America (The Good Years: From 1900 to the First World War, 1960), Coastwatchers (Lonely Vigil, 1977), the Dunkirk evacuation (The Miracle of Dunkirk, 1982), and the civil rights struggle (The Past That Would Not Die, 1965). Shortly after going to work as a copywriter for the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency in New York City, Lord published The Fremantle Diary, edited and annotated from the journals of the British officer and Confederate sympathizer, Arthur Fremantle, who toured the South for three months in 1863. It became a mild, but surprising, success in 1954, as Lord was well into completing A Night to Remember, which would win him much popular acclaim. A Night to Remember, about the sinking of the RMS Titanic, became a bestseller in 1955 and was made into a popular 1958 British movie of the same name. The historian tracked down 63 Titanic survivors and wrote a dramatic, minute-by-minute account of the ocean liner\\'s sinking during her maiden voyage. Lord\\'s knowledge of the Titanic catastrophe achieved considerable renown, and he frequently lectured at meetings of the Titanic Historical Society. In his final years, Lord wrote another book about the Titanic titled The Night Lives On: Thoughts, Theories and Revelations about the Titanic, published in 1986, a year after the wreck of the Titanic was discovered and interest in the Titanic renewed again. In the next decade, Lord served as a consultant to director James Cameron during the filming of Titanic (1997). The sequel documentary to Cameron\\'s film Titanic, Ghosts of the Abyss (2003), was dedicated to Lord\\'s memory.In 2009, Jenny Lawrence edited and published a biography of Lord — The Way It Was: Walter Lord on His Life and Books. In the late 1980s, Lawrence had recorded hours of interviews she had with Lord, in which he discussed his writing and life. After chapters on his early life in Baltimore and up to his time with the OSS in London and Paris, chapters are devoted to his research and writing of each of his books. === Death === Lord died at age 84 on May 19, 2002, after suffering from Parkinson\\'s disease, at his Manhattan home. Noted historian David McCullough said of Lord at his death, \"He was one of the most generous and kind-hearted men I\\'ve ever known, and when I had stars in my eyes and wanted to become a writer, he was a great help.

              " 'An act of entrustment is one of four essential requirements which must be in place under European Union law in order to ensure that the financial compensation paid to an organisation providing a public service is not treated as \"state aid\" as defined by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Article 106(2) of the Treaty (formerly Article 86(2) of the European Communities Treaty), states that: Undertakings entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest or having the character of a revenue-producing monopoly shall be subject to the rules contained in the Treaties, in particular to the rules on competition, in so far as the application of such rules does not obstruct the performance, in law or in fact, of the particular tasks assigned to them. The development of trade must not be affected to such an extent as would be contrary to the interests of the Union. In its judgment in the case of Altmark Trans GmbH and Regierungsprasidium Magdeburg v. Nahverkehrsgesellschaft Altmark GmbH (the Altmark case), the Court of Justice of the European Union held that public sector compensation does not constitute state aid if the following four criteria are all met: The organisation receiving funds (compensation) must actually have public service obligations to discharge, and the obligations must be clearly defined; The parameters on the basis of which the compensation is calculated must be established in advance in an objective and transparent manner; The compensation must not exceed what is necessary to cover all or part of the costs incurred in the discharge of the public sector obligations, taking into account the relevant receipts and a reasonable profit; Either,– The undertaking which is to discharge the public service obligations must have been chosen pursuant to a public procurement procedure which would allow for the selection of the bidder capable of providing the services at the least cost to the community; or – The level of compensation needed must be determined on the basis of an analysis of the costs which a typical undertaking, well run and adequately equipped, would have incurred.The European Commission has stated that an \"act of entrustment\" is necessary in order to set out the public service obligations of the undertaking and must have been committed to the organisation through an official act having legal force under the national law of the relevant EU member state. There need not be any specific legal framework covering acts of entrustment, but the act must extend sufficiently to create an obligation or accountability: permission, such as legal recognition or regulatory approval would not be sufficient. The obligation may be set out in legislation, the terms of a contract or in certain cases in a grant agreement. The act of entrustment should, in particular, state the nature, territorial scope and duration of the public service obligations, the organisation concerned, and the nature of any exclusive or special rights which the organisation may be able to exercise, along with the mechanism for calculating the level of compensation. == References ==',\n",

Its distribution is restricted to Huangshan Mountains in Anhui and Jiande and Anji counties in northern Zhejiang. It occurs in fast-flowing streams and the surrounding habitats, and breeds in streams. The informally assigned common name for frogs in this genus (and for frogs in certain other genera) is torrent frog. == Taxonomy == This species was formerly placed in the genus Amolops and later on separated in a monotypic genus Wurana. It was eventually recognized to belong in the genus Odorrana where it is perhaps closely related to O. versabilis and the long-snout torrent frog (O. nasica) which also was for long placed in Amolops. The informally assigned common name for frogs in this genus (and for frogs in certain other genera) is torrent frog == Ultrasonic communication == Concave-eared torrent frog is the first frog (and the first non-mammalian vertebrate) demonstrated to both produce and perceive ultrasonic frequencies. These frogs' preferred habitat is adjacent to rapidly moving water which produces perpetual low-frequency background noise. Thus, the use of high-frequency calls is believed to facilitate intraspecific communication within the frogs' noisy environment.Concave-eared torrent frogs have extremely thin eardrums recessed in their ears, which allows for the ear bones that connect the drum to sound processing part of the ear to be shorter and lighter. Most frogs have thick eardrums close to the surface of the skin and can only hear frequencies below 12 kilohertz.

              " 'A smoke ring is a visible vortex ring formed by smoke in a clear atmosphere. Smokers may blow smoke rings from the mouth, intentionally or accidentally. Smoke rings may also be formed by sudden bursts of fire (such as lighting and immediately putting out a cigarette lighter), by shaking a smoke source (such as an incense stick) up and down, by firing certain types of artillery, or by the use of special devices, such as vortex ring guns and vortex ring toys. The head of a mushroom cloud is a large smoke ring. A smoke ring is commonly formed when a puff of smoke is suddenly injected into clear air, especially through a narrow opening. The outer parts of the puff are slowed by the still air (or by edges of the opening) relative to the central part, imparting it the characteristic poloidal flow pattern. The smoke makes the ring visible, but does not significantly affect the flow. The same phenomenon occurs with any fluid, producing vortex rings which are invisible but otherwise entirely similar to smoke rings. == Smoking and breathing == A smoker may produce rings by taking smoke into their mouth and expelling it with a tongue flick, by closing the jaw, tapping the cheek, or producing a sudden burst of air with the lungs and throat. The smoker may also use any of those methods to blow into a cloud of smoke outside their mouth. A trick often performed in conjunction with mouth-blown smoke rings is the French inhale. It is also possible to produce a vapour ring by using the same techniques on a cold day by exhaling.The most famous such steam rings were those produced during the mid-20th century by Douglas Leigh\\'s billboard on the Hotel Claridge in New York City\\'s Times Square, advertising Camel cigarettes. An automated steam chamber behind the billboard produced puffs of steam every four seconds, giving the appearance of smoke rings leaving the smoker\\'s open mouth and drifting away. Inspired by a World War II-era prohibition on lighted advertising, the Camel smoker remained a Times Square landmark long afterward.Some users of electronic cigarettes modify their devices to inhale large amounts of vapour at once, to exhale \"clouds\" in patterns like smoke rings. == Volcanoes == Under particular conditions, some volcanic vents can produce large visible smoke rings. Though a rare phenomenon, several volcanoes have been observed emitting massive vortex rings of steam and gas: Mount Etna, Italy (Sicily) Stromboli, Italy (Aeolian Islands) Eyjafjallajökull, Iceland Hekla, Iceland Tungurahua, Ecuador Pacaya, Guatemala Mount Redoubt, United States (Alaska) Mount Aso, Japan (Kyushu) Whakaari (White Island), New Zealand Gunung Slamet, Indonesia (Central Java) Momotombo, Nicaragua (León) == See also == Bubble ring Vortex ring toy == References == == External links == How to puff a smoke ring?

              " 'Cluedo (), known as Clue in North America, is a murder mystery game for three to six players (depending on editions) that was devised in 1943 by British board game designer Anthony E. Pratt. The game was first manufactured by Waddingtons in the United Kingdom in 1949. Since then, it has been relaunched and updated several times, and it is currently owned and published by the American game and toy company Hasbro. The object of the game is to determine who murdered the game\\'s victim, where the crime took place, and which weapon was used. Each player assumes the role of one of the six suspects and attempts to deduce the correct answer by strategically moving around a game board representing the rooms of a mansion and collecting clues about the circumstances of the murder from the other players. Numerous games, books, a film, television series, and a musical have been released as part of the Cluedo franchise. Several spinoffs have been released featuring various extra characters, weapons and rooms, or different game play. The original game is marketed as the \"Classic Detective Game\", and the various spinoffs are all distinguished by different slogans. In 2008, Cluedo: Discover the Secrets was created (with changes to board, gameplay and characters) as a modern spin-off, but was criticised in the media and by fans of the original game. Cluedo: The Classic Mystery Game was then introduced in 2012, returning to Pratt\\'s classic formula but also adding several variations. == History == Holed up in his home in Birmingham, England during air raids on the city during World War II, Anthony E. Pratt, an English musician and factory worker, recalled the murder mystery games played by some of his clients at private music gigs as well as the detective fiction popular at the time, most notably Agatha Christie. In 1944, Pratt applied for a patent of his invention of a murder/mystery-themed game, originally named Murder! Shortly thereafter, Pratt and his wife, Elva Pratt (1913–1990), who had helped design the game, presented it to Waddingtons\\' executive Norman Watson, who immediately purchased it and provided its trademark name of Cluedo (a play on \"clue\" and Ludo, ludo being Latin for \"I play\").Although the patent was granted in 1947, postwar shortages postponed the game\\'s official United Kingdom launch until 1949. It was simultaneously licensed to Parker Brothers in the United States for publication, where it was renamed Clue.There were several differences between the original game concept and the one initially published in 1949. In particular, Pratt\\'s original design calls for 10 characters, one of whom was to be designated the victim by random drawing prior to the start of the game. These 10 included the eliminated Mr. Brown, Mr. Gold, Miss Grey, and Mrs. Silver. The characters of Nurse White and Colonel Yellow were renamed Mrs. White and Colonel Mustard for the actual release. The game allowed for play of up to eight remaining characters, providing for nine suspects in total. Originally there were 11 rooms, including the eliminated gun room and cellar. In addition, there were nine weapons, including the unused bomb, syringe, shillelagh (walking stick/cudgel), fireplace poker, and the later used axe and poison. Some of these unused weapons and characters appeared later in spin-off versions of the game.Some gameplay aspects were different as well. Notably, the remaining playing cards were distributed into the rooms to be retrieved, rather than dealt directly to the players. Players also had to land on another player in order to make suggestions about that player\\'s character through the use of special countertokens, and once exhausted, a player could no longer make suggestions. There were other minor differences, all of which were later updated by the game\\'s initial release and remain essentially unchanged in the standard Classic Detective Game editions of the game.The methodology used in the early versions of Cluedo is remarkably similar to a traditional, if little known, American card game, The King of Hearts Has Five Sons. However, Pratt himself said his inspiration was a murder mystery parlour game he used to play with friends in which youngsters \"would congregate in each other\\'s homes for parties at weekends. We\\'d play a stupid game called Murder, where guests crept up on each other in corridors and the victim would shriek and fall on the floor\". The country house mystery was a popular subgenre of \"cosy\" English detective fiction in the 1920s and 1930s; stories were set in a residence of the gentry isolated by circumstances such as a snowstorm with the suspects gathered for a weekend house party. === Marketing === Cluedo was originally marketed as \"The Great New Detective Game\" upon its launch in 1949 in North America. A deal was quickly struck to license \"The Great New Sherlock Holmes Game\" from the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle estate. Advertising at the time suggested players would take on the guise of \"Sherlock Holmes following the path of the criminal\", but no depictions of Holmes appear in the advertising or on the box. From 1950 until the 1960s, the game was marketed as \"The Great Detective Game\", at which time it became the \"Parker Brothers Detective Game\". With the launch of the US 1972 edition, a television commercial showed Holmes and Watson engaged in a particularly competitive game. Adjusting with the times, in 1979 US television commercials a detective, resembling a bumbling Inspector Clouseau from the popular Pink Panther film franchise, looks for clues. In 1986, the marketing slogan added \"Classic Detective Game\" which persists through the last 2002/2003 edition. In the UK, Cluedo was marketed as \"The Great Detective Game\" from the mid-1950s until 2000, when it was rebranded as the \"Classic Detective Game\". However, in the mid-1950s Waddingtons also adopted a Sherlock Holmes-type detective to adorn their box covers for a brief time, though unlike in the US editions, there was no acknowledgement that the character was actually the famous detective. In the 1980s, as in the US, Sherlock Holmes also appeared in TV advertising of the time, along with other classic detectives such as Sam Spade. == Game == === Equipment === The game consists of a board which shows the rooms, corridors and secret-passages of an English country house called Tudor Mansion (named Tudor Close, Tudor Hall, Arlington Grange, Boddy Manor or Boddy Mansion in some editions) in Hampshire, England, in 1926. The game box also includes several coloured playing pieces to represent characters, miniature murder weapon props, two six-sided dice, three sets of cards (describing the aforementioned rooms, characters or weapons), Solution Cards and an envelope (or a mirror in some editions) to contain one card from each set of cards, and a Detective\\'s Notes pad on which are printed lists of rooms, weapons and characters, so players can keep detailed notes during the game. === Characters === The murder victim in the game was known as \"Dr. Black\" in the UK edition and \"Mr. Boddy\" in North American versions. The current UK and North American editions of the game, released by Hasbro in 2023, refer to him as \"Boden \\'Boddy\\' Black Jr.\"Players\\' tokens are typically plastic pawns or figurines; the standard edition of Cluedo has six of these suspects: Miss Scarlett. (The second \"T\" was dropped in North American versions after 1963 and added back in 2016.) She is represented by a red token/figurine. Reverend Green. (\"Mr. Green\" in North America; \"Mayor Green\" in the 2023 UK and North America editions.) He is represented by a green token/figurine. Colonel Mustard. He is represented by a yellow token/figurine. Professor Plum. He is represented by a purple token/figurine. Mrs. Peacock. (\"Solicitor Peacock\" in the 2023 UK and North American editions.) She is represented by a blue token/figurine. Mrs. White. (\"Chef White\" in the 2023 UK and North American editions.) She is represented by a white token/figurine. Dr. Orchid replaced Mrs. White in the North American 2016 edition and is represented by a pink token. Dr. Orchid was replaced by Chef White in the 2023 UK and North American editions. === Weapons === The weapon icons are typically made of unfinished pewter (except the rope, which may be plastic or string); special editions have included gold plated, brass finished and sterling silver versions. Candlestick Dagger (Knife in some North American editions) Lead Pipe (called lead piping in earlier UK editions; the early tokens were made out of actual lead and therefore posed a risk of lead poisoning) Revolver (first depicted in the UK as a Dreyse M1907 semi-automatic pistol, and in North America as a Colt M1911 pistol) Rope Wrench (depicted as a monkey wrench in North American editions and an open-ended spanner in some traditional UK versions) === Rooms === There are nine rooms in the mansion where the murder can take place,: 121 laid out around the edge of the square game board. Each of the four corner rooms contains a secret passage that leads to the room on the opposite diagonal corner of the map. The centre room (often referred to as the Cellar or Stairs) is inaccessible to the players, but contains the solution envelope, and is not otherwise used during game play. Each suspect token has a designated start space marked at the edge of the board. The corridor areas are marked out as square spaces through which the tokens move horizontally or vertically. === Rules === At the beginning of play, three cards—one suspect, one room, and one weapon—are chosen at random and put into a special envelope, so that no one can see them. These cards represent the solution. The remainder of the cards are distributed among the players. Players are instructed to assume the token/suspect nearest them. In older versions, play begins with Miss Scarlett and proceeds clockwise. In modern versions, all players roll the die/dice and the highest total starts the game, with play again proceeding clockwise. Players roll the die/dice and move along the board\\'s corridor spaces, or into the rooms accordingly. The objective of the game is to deduce the details of the murder, i.e. the cards in the envelope. There are six characters, six murder weapons and nine rooms, leaving the players with 324 possibilities. As soon as a player enters a room, they may make a suggestion as to the details, naming a suspect, the room they are in, and weapon. For example: \"I suspect Professor Plum, in the Dining Room, with the candlestick\". The player\\'s suggestions must include the room they are currently in and may not be made in the corridors. The tokens for the suggested suspect and weapon are immediately moved into that room, if they are not both already present. Suggesting an opponent\\'s token is a legitimate board strategy; likewise the weapon icons, though esoteric. A player may even suggest himself or herself as the murderer and may include cards in their own hand. Once a player makes a suggestion, the others are called upon to disprove it. If the player to their left holds any of the three named cards, that player must privately show one (and only one) of the cards to the current player. Otherwise, the process continues clockwise around the table until either one player disproves the accusation, or no one can do so. A player\\'s turn normally ends once their suggestion is completed. A player who believes they have determined the correct elements may make an accusation on their turn. The accusation can include any room, not necessarily the one occupied by the player (if any), and may be made immediately following a suggestion. The accusing player privately checks the three cards in the envelope. If they match the accusation, the player shows them to everyone and wins; if not, the player returns them to the envelope and may not move nor make suggestions/accusations for the remainder of the game; in effect, \"losing\". However, the other players can move their token into rooms when making suggestions and they must continue to privately show cards in order to disprove suggestions. A player who makes a false accusation while blocking the door to a room must move into that room so others can enter and leave. If all players except for one player have made an incorrect accusation, the remaining player automatically wins. If a player\\'s suggestion has brought another player\\'s token into a room, the second player may make their own suggestion in the room when their turn comes up, if desired. If not, they may move out of the room, and if able to reach another room, make a suggestion therein, as usual. In the American version, players are not allowed to make suggestions repeatedly by remaining in one room; if they wish to make a second suggestion, they must first spend a turn out of the room. === Strategy === ==== Choice of playing piece ==== The first opportunity is in choosing the initial playing piece. Mrs. Peacock has an immediate advantage of starting one space closer to the first room than any of the other players. Professor Plum can move to the study, and then take the secret-passage to the Kitchen, the hardest room to reach.Traditionally, Miss Scarlett had the advantage of moving first. This has been eliminated with the implementation of the high roll rule in modern versions. ==== Navigating the board ==== The next opportunity is choice of initial rooms to enter. Again Mrs. Peacock has an advantage in that she is closest to the Conservatory, a corner room with a secret passage, enabling a player on their turn to move immediately to another room and make a suggestion after rolling the dice. Miss Scarlett has a similar advantage with the Lounge. Making as many suggestions as possible maximises how much information a player can gain, which is advantageous. Therefore, moving into a new room as frequently as possible is one way to meet this goal. Players should make good use of the secret passages. Following the shortest path between rooms then is a good choice, even if a player already holds the card representing that room in their hand. As mentioned earlier, blocking passage of another player prevents them from attaining rooms from which to make suggestions. Various single space tracks on the board can therefore become traps, which are best avoided by a player when planning a path from room to room. ==== Making suggestions ==== Each player begins the game with three to six cards in their hand, depending on the number of players. Keeping track of which cards are shown to each player is important in deducing the solution. Detective Notes are supplied with the game to help make this task easier. The pads can keep not only a history of which cards are in a player\\'s hand, but also which cards have been shown by another player. It can also be useful in deducing which cards the other players have shown one another. For example, if Miss Scarlett disproves Rev. Green\\'s accusation that Mrs. Peacock did the crime in the Ballroom with the Candlestick, a player with both the Ballroom and Mrs. Peacock cards in their hand can then deduce that Miss Scarlett has the Candlestick.A player makes a suggestion to learn which cards may be eliminated from suspicion, but in some cases it may be advantageous for a player to include one of their own cards in a suggestion. This technique can be used for both forcing a player to reveal a different card as well as misleading other players into believing a specific card is suspect. Therefore, moving into a room already held in the player\\'s hand may work to their advantage. Suggestions may also be used to thwart a player\\'s opponent. Since every suggestion results in a suspect token being re-located to the suggested room, a suggestion may be used to prevent another player from achieving their intended destination, preventing them from suggesting a particular room, especially if that player appears to be getting close to a solution. ==== Notetaking ==== One reason the game is enjoyed by many ages and skill levels is that the complexity of note-taking can increase as a player becomes more skillful. Beginners may simply mark off the cards they have been shown; more advanced players will keep track of who has and who does not have a particular card, possibly with the aid of an additional grid. Expert players may keep track of each suggestion made, knowing that the player who answers it must have at least one of the cards named, which one can be deduced by later events. One can also keep track of which cards a given player has seen, in order to minimise information revealed to that player and/or to read into that player\\'s suggestions. == Editions == Parker Brothers and Waddingtons each produced their own unique editions between 1949 and 1992. Hasbro purchased both companies in the early 1990s and continued to produce unique editions for each market until 2002/2003 when the current edition of Cluedo/Clue was first released. At this time, Hasbro produced a unified product across markets. The game was then localised with regional differences in spelling and naming conventions. During Cluedo\\'s long history, eight unique Clue editions were published in North America (1949, 1956/1960, 1960/1963, 1972, 1986, 1992, 1996, and 2002), including miniaturised \"travel\" editions. However, only three distinct editions of Cluedo were released in the UK – the longest of which lasted 47 years from its introduction in 1949 until its first successor in 1996. The eighth North America and fourth UK editions constitute the current shared game design. International versions occasionally developed their own unique designs for specific editions, although most drew on the designs and art from either the US or UK editions, and in some cases mixing elements from both, while localising others – specifically suspect portraits.In July 2008, Hasbro released a revamped look for Clue in a Reinvention called \"Clue: Discover the Secrets\". This new version of the game offered major changes to the game play and to the characters and their back stories. In July 2016, Hasbro replaced Mrs. White with a new character, Dr. Orchid, represented by an orchid pink piece. In this current standard edition, Mrs. Peacock has a new game opening opportunity as her starting square is one step closer to the billiard room (with 9 steps instead of 10). The squared off door to the Conservatory makes the room harder for Rev. Green to reach as an opening move and increases the distance between the Ballroom and the Conservatory (from 4 steps to 5). While the suspects\\' appearance and interior design of Dr. Black\\'s/Mr. Boddy\\'s mansion changed with each edition, the weapons underwent relatively minor changes, with the only major redesign occurring in the fourth 1972 US edition, which was adopted by the second 1996 UK edition and remains the standard configuration across all Classic Detective Game versions since. The artwork for the previous US editions tended to reflect the current popular style at the time they were released. The earlier UK editions were more artistically stylised themes. From 1972 on, the US editions presented lush box cover art depicting the six suspects in various candid poses within a room of the mansion. The UK would finally adopt this style only in its third release in 2000, prior to which Cluedo boxes depicted basic representations of the contents. Such lavish box art illustrations have become a hallmark of the game, since copied for the numerous licensed variants which pay homage to Clue. === Cluedo: Discover the Secrets === In August 2008, Hasbro redesigned and updated the board, characters, weapons, and rooms. Changes to the rules of game play were made, some to accommodate the new features. The suspects have new given names and backgrounds, as well as differing abilities that may be used during the game. The revolver is now a pistol, the lead pipe and spanner/wrench have been removed, and a baseball bat, axe, dumbbell, trophy, and poison have been added. The nine rooms have changed to (in clockwise order): Hall, Guest House, Dining Room, Kitchen, Patio, Spa, Theatre, Living Room, and Observatory.There is also a second deck of cards—the Intrigue cards. In this deck, there are two types of cards, Keepers and Clocks. Keepers are special abilities; for example, \"You can see the card\". There are eight clocks—the first seven drawn do nothing—whoever draws the eighth is killed by the murderer and out of the game.The player must move to the indoor swimming pool in the centre of the board to make an accusation. This adds some challenge versus the ability to make accusations from anywhere in the original game. The most significant change to game play is that once the suspect cards have been taken, the remaining cards are dealt so that all players have an even number of cards (rather than dealt out so that \"one player may have a slight advantage\"). This means that depending on the number of players a number of cards are left over. These cards are placed face down in the middle and are not seen unless a player takes a turn in the pool room to look at them. The changes to the game have been criticised in the media, and by fans of the game, for unnecessarily altering classic cultural icons.As of 2017, Hasbro no longer sells the game via its website, but they do continue to sell a version of it as part of their Grab & Go travel series. Notably, it plays identically to standard classic rules, but visually continues to use the new Discover the Secrets room layout, and two of the new weapons, as well as other design artwork. However, the Intrigue cards are no longer a part of the game. === Clue/Cluedo: The Classic Mystery Game === Clue/Cluedo is a digital adaptation based on the official Hasbro board game developed by Marmalade Game Studio for iOS and Android mobile devices as well as Steam and Nintendo Switch. The object of the game is to determine who killed the game\\'s victim Dr. Black (or Mr. Boddy). The player, as one of the six suspects, will ask questions and take notes. The overall goal is to solve the crime first. === Notable editions === Clue \"Master Detective\" (1988), an expanded version of the game featuring 12 rooms, 10 characters, and eight weapons with support for up to 10 players. In addition to the regular cast, Clue Master Detective adds Miss Peach, Monsieur Brunette, Madame Rose, and Sergeant Gray to the list of suspects. It also added poison and a horseshoe to the assortment of weapons. The fountain, the gazebo, and the carriage house were added to the list of rooms. This game is currently published in the USA by Winning Moves Games USA. Cluedo: 50th Anniversary (1999), also released as Clue: 50th Anniversary, this standard edition came in a \"deluxe\" format with the option to play with an extra murder weapon, a bottle of poison. This edition was also issued in a miniaturised Cluedo European travel version. Drew Struzan provided artwork for the game, which was originally created for the US 1996 edition and additionally used for The Limited Gift Edition and the US Clue Card Game, but he did not create the Rev. Green portrait used in the Cluedo editions. Clue \"Nostalgia Edition\" (2003, 2007) is a retro Nostalgia edition of the game, essentially a re-issue of the 1963 design in a wooden box. A custom version of the game was also released in the US by Restoration Hardware as Wooden Box Clue with different cover art. In the UK it was released under the Cluedo brand, and was an official re-issue of the original 1949 Waddingtons\\' design. Clue \"Vintage Edition\" (2005, 2009), also released as Cluedo \"Vintage Edition\", is a re-formatted nostalgia edition into a \"vintage\" bookshelf collection along with a series of other popular boardgames. In the Cluedo version, they continued to use the 1963 design and adapted it for the UK market for the first time with localised characters and naming conventions. == Franchise == The board game spawned a franchise, which since 1985 has expanded to include a feature film, mini-series, a musical, numerous books and several video games. == Worldwide differences == Besides some rule differences listed above, some versions label differently the names of characters, weapons, rooms and in some instances the actual game itself. In Canada and the U.S., the game is known as Clue. It was retitled because the traditional British board game Ludo, on which the name is based, was less well known there than its American variant Parcheesi.The North American versions of Clue also replace the character \"Reverend Green\" from the original Cluedo with \"Mr. Green\". This is the only region to continue to make such a change. Minor changes include \"Miss Scarlett\" with her name being spelt with one \\'t\\', the spanner being called a wrench, and the dagger renamed a knife. In the 2016 U.S. edition, the knife was changed to a dagger. Until 2003, the lead piping was known as the lead pipe only in the North American edition. In some international versions of the game (mostly the Spanish-language ones) the colours of some pieces are different, so as to correspond with the changes to each suspect\\'s unique foreign name variations. In some cases, rooms and weapons are changed in addition to other regional variances.In South America it is licensed and sold under several different names. It is marketed as Detetive in Brazil. == Reception == Games magazine included Clue in their \"Top 100 Games of 1980\", praising it as \"still the classic detective game\".Games magazine included Clue in their \"Top 100 Games of 1981\", noting that the \"characters in this 32-year-old game have become household words\" and that the game is best played with four to six players.Games magazine included Clue in their \"Top 100 Games of 1982\", noting that \"Millions love this classic mystery game\" and that \"it\\'s more satisfying to win through careful deduction than by a lucky stab\". == See also == 13 Dead End Drive (related board game) Clue (1992 video game) Clue (1998 video game) Kill Doctor Lucky (related board game and parody) Orient Express (related board game) Mr. Ree!

              " 'Junonia lemonias, the lemon pansy, is a common nymphalid butterfly found in Cambodia and South Asia. It is found in gardens, fallow land, and open wooded areas. == Description == It is brown with numerous eyespots as well as black and lemon-yellow spots and lines on the upperside of the wings. The underside is a dull brown, with a number of wavy lines and spots in varying shades of brown and black. There is also an eyespot on the lower side of the forewing. The wet- and dry-season forms differ considerably in coloration and even shape. In the wet-season form the markings are distinct and vivid and the wing shape is a little more rounded. In the dry-season form the markings are obscure and pale especially on the underside and the wing margin is more angular and jagged. This helps it camouflage in the dried leaf litter.The lemon pansy is a very active butterfly and can be seen basking with its wings open facing the sun. It sits very low to the ground and can be approached easily. It feeds with its wings half open. It is a fairly strong flier and flies close to the ground with rapid wingbeats and often returns to settle back in the same spots. == Life cycle == === Eggs === Eggs are laid singly on the underside of leaves. The egg is green and barrel shaped with longitudinal ridges. === Caterpillar === The caterpillar is cylindrical, uniformly thick and covered with rows of spines which are branched at the tip. It is dull black with a faint blue sheen and has dorsal stripe of a darker color. There is a distinct orange ring behind the head. The caterpillar stays on the underside of the leaf and if disturbed, rolls up and drops to the ground. === Pupa === Pupation takes place in dense foliage close to the ground. The pupa is compact, with small conical processes on its rough surface. The pupa is well camouflaged with varying shades of brown with fine streaks and lines. === Food plants === Caterpillars feed on plants from the families Acanthaceae, Amaranthaceae, Malvaceae, Rubiaceae, Tiliaceae and Verbenaceae. Recorded species include Alternanthera sessilis, Barleria cristata, Barleria prionitis, Blechum pyramidatum, Cannabis sativa, Corchorus capsularis, Dyschoriste repens, Eranthemum pulchellum, Hemigraphis schomburgkii, Hygrophila auriculata, Hygrophila costata, Hygrophila lancea, Lepidagathis formosensis, Lepidagathis incurva, Nelsonia canescens, Ophiorrhiza japonica, Phyla nodiflora, Ruellia tuberosa, Sida rhombifolia, and Strobilanthes formosanus. == See also == List of butterflies of India == Notes == == References == Evans, W.H.

              " 'Naomi Schor (October 10, 1943 in New York City – December 2, 2001 in New Haven, Connecticut ) was an American literary critic and theorist. A pioneer of feminist theory for her generation, she is regarded as one of the foremost scholars of French literature and critical theory of her time. Naomi\\'s younger sister is the artist and writer Mira Schor. == Early life and education == At the time of her birth, Naomi Schor\\'s Polish-born parents Ilya and Resia Schor were artists who had recently immigrated to the US as refugees from war-torn Europe. Ilya Schor was a painter, jeweler and artist of Judaica, and Resia Schor was a painter who later worked in silver and gold and mixed media on sculptural jewelry and Judaica. The Schors lived among a polyglot community of émigrés, among them musicians, intellectuals, and artists. Naomi Schor’s first language was French, and she went to the Lycée Français de New York where she received her Baccalauréat in 1961, the same year, sadly, that her father died. Schor received her B.A. in English Literature from Barnard College then received her PhD in French Literature from Yale. There Schor occasionally wrote her scholarly essays in French. == Scholarship == Schor was one of the early proponents of French psychoanalytic and deconstructive theory in American literary studies. She wrote about canonical authors such as Émile Zola, Gustave Flaubert, Marcel Proust, Honoré de Balzac, re-examining their work through the double lens of the male-authored theoretical discourse of Jacques Derrida (whom she knew personally), Roland Barthes, and Jacques Lacan, and that of French feminist theoreticians such as Julia Kristeva, Hélène Cixous, and Luce Irigaray. Schor was the founding co-editor of differences: A Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies, in 1989, a critical forum where the problematics of difference is explored in texts ranging from the literary and the visual to the political and social. An area of Schor’s expertise was the work of the feminist psychoanalytic theorist Luce Irigaray. With Carolyn Burke and Margaret Whitford, she edited Engaging with Irigaray, which included essays by Rosi Braidotti, Elizabeth Weed, and Judith Butler. With differences co-founder and co-editor Weed, Schor edited a number of differences books, including The Essential Difference in 1994 and Queer Theory Meets Feminism in 1997. Reading in Detail: Aesthetics and the Feminine is considered one of Schor’s most influential books. In this classic 1987 work of aesthetic and feminist theory, available in a 2006 paperback edition, Schor provided new ways of thinking about the gendering of details and ornament in literature, art, and architecture. In other writings she developed the concept of female fetishism, in her many writings on the work of George Sand; she examined the question of idealism, also in relation to Sand, and in her late writings and research revisited the concept of universalism in an era of identity politics and difference. == Awards and honors == Schor was the recipient of numerous awards and honors, including a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship (1963–64), a number of Fulbright Award Fellowships to France, NEH Fellowships (1981 and 1990–91), a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1990: She was also elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1997. Schor taught at Columbia, Brown (from 1978 to 1989) where she held the Nancy Duke Lewis Chair from 1985 to 1989, Duke where she was the William Hanes Wannamaker Professor of Romance Studies Chair, and Harvard. At the time of her death (of a brain hemorrhage) Schor was the Benjamin F. Barge professor of French at Yale.Naomi Schor’s papers are part of the Pembroke Center Archive\\'s Elizabeth Weed Feminist Theory Papers collection, held at the John Hay Library at Brown University. == Personal life == At the time of her death she was married to R. Howard Bloch, Sterling Professor of French and Chair of the Humanities Program at Yale.

              " 'Thomas Charles Buckland McLeish (1 May 1962 – 27 February 2023) was a British theoretical physicist. His work is renowned for increasing understanding of the properties of soft matter. This is matter that can be easily changed by stress – including liquids, foams and biological materials. He was professor in the Durham University Department of Physics and director of the Durham Centre for Soft Matter, a multidisciplinary team that works across physics, chemistry, mathematics and engineering. He also was the first Chair of Natural Philosophy at the University of York. == Early life and education == McLeish was born on 1 May 1962. He was educated at Sevenoaks School in Kent and Emmanuel College, Cambridge where he was awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1984 (MA, 1987) and a PhD in 1987 for research on fluid dynamics. == Academic career == McLeish began his academic career as a lecturer in physics at the University of Sheffield (1989 to 1993). He then moved to the University of Leeds, where he was Professor of Polymer Physics between 1993 and 2008. He was Professor of Physics at the University of Durham from 2008 to 2018. He was additionally Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Research between 2008 and 2014.In February 2018, McLeish moved to the University of York to take up the newly created Chair in Natural Philosophy. === Research === Although McLeish\\'s work was mostly theoretical, he also worked closely with those performing experiments and in industry. He made significant advances in modelling the structure and properties of complex entangled molecules, blends of substances that don\\'t usually mix (multiphasic liquids like oil and water - see reptation and crazing). This allows complex fluid behaviour and processing in an industrial setting to be more easily predicted. Since 2000 he worked on biological physics: applying soft matter physics to self-assembly of protein fibrils, protein fluctuation dynamics and its role in allosteric signalling, and statistical mechanics approaches to evolution. As of 2015 he had published around 200 papers in peer reviewed scientific journals. == Personal life == In 1984, McLeish married Julie Elizabeth King. Together they had four children: two sons and two daughters.McLeish\\'s other interests included historical studies of medieval science, and he was a member of the Institute of Medieval and Early Modern Studies at Durham. In 1993, he became a lay preacher in the Anglican Church, delivering sermons at St Michael le Belfrey, York. In 2014, he published a book on the relationship between religion and science called Faith and Wisdom in Science.McLeish died on 27 February 2023, at the age of 60. == Honours == McLeish was made a Fellow of the Institute of Physics (FInstP) in 2003, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry (FRSC) in 2008. In 2011, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS), the United Kingdom\\'s national academy of the sciences.In 2007, McLeish was awarded the Weissenberg medal by the European Society of Rheology. This is awarded to rheologists conducting research in Europe for outstanding, long-term achievements. McLeish also received the Society of Rheology\\'s Bingham Medal in 2010. In 2017, McLeish received the Sam Edwards Medal and Prize for \"his sustained and outstanding contributions to the fields of molecular rheology, macromolecular biophysics and self-assembly\".In 2018, McLeish was awarded the Lanfranc Award for Education and Scholarship by the Archbishop of Canterbury \"for his record as one of the most outstanding scientists of his generation, and the leading contemporary lay Anglican voice in the dialogue of science and faith\".McLeish gave the 2021 Boyle Lecture (International Society for Science and Religion, ISSR) entitled \"Rediscovering Science as Contemplation.\" A recording is available on the ISSR\\'s YouTube channel. == Selected publications == The Poetry and Music of Science: Comparing Creativity in Science and Art (2019) OXFORD University Press, ISBN 9780198797999 Soft Matter – An Emergent Interdisciplinary Science of Emergent Entities, Chapter 20 in The Routledge Handbook of Emergence, (eds.)

It can be prepared by slowly adding excess bromine to a hot solution of phenolsulfonphthalein in glacial acetic acid. == Acid–base indicator == As an acid–base indicator, its useful range lies between pH 3.0 and 4.6. It changes from yellow at pH 3.0 to blue at pH 4.6; this reaction is reversible. Bromophenol blue is structurally related to phenolphthalein (a popular indicator). == Color marker == Bromophenol is also used as a colour marker to monitor the process of agarose gel electrophoresis and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Since bromophenol blue carries a slight negative charge at moderate pH, it will migrate in the same direction as DNA or protein in a gel; the rate at which it migrates varies according to gel density and buffer composition, but in a typical 1% agarose gel in a 1X TAE buffer or TBE buffer, bromophenol blue migrates at the same rate as a DNA fragment of about 300 base pairs, in 2% agarose as 150 bp. Xylene cyanol and orange G may also be used for this purpose. == Dye == Bromophenol blue is also used as a dye. At neutral pH, the dye absorbs red light most strongly and transmits blue light. (Its peak absorbance is 600 nm at a basic pH of 12.) Solutions of the dye, therefore, are blue. At low pH, the dye absorbs ultraviolet and blue light most strongly and appears yellow in solution. In solution at pH 3.6 (in the middle of the transition range of this pH indicator) obtained by dissolution in water without any pH adjustment, bromophenol blue has a characteristic green red colour, where the apparent colour shifts depending on the concentration and/or path length through which the solution is observed. This phenomenon is called dichromatic color. Bromophenol blue is the substance with the highest known value of Kreft's dichromaticity index. This means it has the largest change in colour hue, when the thickness or concentration of observed sample increases or decreases. == See also == Bromophenol == References == == External links == Bromophenol blue at OpenWetWare\",\n",

Much of it was syndicated through Franklin Pierce Adams' Conning Tower column published in the New York World newspaper. Mullins published four collections of poetry: Earthbound and Other Poems (1929), Balm in Gilead (1930), Streams from the Source (1938), and The Mirrored Walls and Other Poems (1970). She authored two novels early in her career: Paulus Fy: the History of an Aesthete (1924), co-written with her sister, Marie Gallegher, and Convent Girl (1929). Mullins' work was included in Modern American Poetry: A Critical Anthology by Louis Untermeyer in 1930.Helene Mullins (née Gallegher) was born in New Rochelle, New York. Aside from some time spent in Hollywood, Santa Fe, and Washington DC, the poet lived most of her adult life in New York City. Mullins was married twice, first to Ivan Mullins in 1920, and then to Linné Johnson in 1958. Helene Mullins' poetry has been compared to that of Christina Rossetti. Her writing was compact, intense, lyrical, and often spiritual. Mullins wrote in a somewhat old-fashioned style for her time, but her poetry nonetheless had a modern sensibility, and it was accessible to the wide audience it reached in Scribner's Magazine, The Atlantic Monthly, The New Yorker, and in wide syndication through the New York World newspaper. In 1927, Mullins was commissioned by the American Opera Company, along with The New Yorker music critic Robert A. Simon, to create a new English libretto for Carmen. The opera's new libretto was performed widely across North America over the next few years.In 1935, Mullins suffered serious injuries when she was struck by a car while crossing the street. She was in a coma for several weeks, and she took several years to recover.Helene Mullins died in 1991, in Manhattan, at the age of 92. == References == == External links == Helene Mullins Archives at Yale - https://archives.yale.edu/agents/people/96767 Pacific Radio Archives recorded interview - https://www.pacificaradioarchives.org/recording/bb3895\",\n",

              " 'The Mormon Reformation was a period of renewed emphasis on spirituality within the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), and a centrally-directed movement, which called for a spiritual reawakening among church members. It took place during 1856 and 1857 and was under the direction of church president Brigham Young. During the Reformation, Young sent his counselor, Jedediah M. Grant, and other church leaders to preach to the people throughout Utah Territory and surrounding Latter-day Saint communities with the goal of inspiring them to reject sin and turn towards spiritual things. During this time, some of the most conservative or reactionary elements of LDS Church doctrine came to dominate public discussion. As part of the Reformation, almost all \"active\" or involved LDS Church members were rebaptized as a symbol of their commitment. The Reformation is considered in three phases: a structural reform phase, a phase of intense demand for a demonstration of spiritual reform, and a final phase during which an emphasis was placed on love and reconstruction. == History == === Economic and spiritual issues === All pioneers who gathered to the Utah Territory between 1847 and the mid-1850s under the direction of Brigham Young, whether members of the LDS Church or sympathetic non-members, were welcome as long as they helped to build up Zion. Developing the land required heavy physical labor. Church members who were willing to physically strengthen the Mormon settlements were so valued that \"problems they might have with smoking, drinking, profaning, Sabbath breaking, and even immoral living did not normally cost them their standing in the community and the Church.\" Consequently, by the early 1850s, many communities within the Mormon settlement region were prosperous and secure, yet contained a segment of inhabitants whose personal practices were not within the exacting standards of the LDS Church.In 1852, Brigham Young felt that the church in Utah was secure enough to announce the practice of plural marriage to the world. Shortly after the announcement, however, the Latter-day Saints in Utah experienced a period of hardship. The population of the Utah territory had increased rapidly as converts from Europe joined American Saints in their migration across the Great Plains. In 1855, a drought struck, due to light snowfall during the winter of 1854. In addition to the damage caused by drought, an infestation of grasshoppers and crickets destroyed their meager crops, and around a third of the valley\\'s cattle perished due to the cold. During the winter of 1855–56, flour and other basic necessities were very scarce and very costly. Heber C. Kimball wrote his son, \"Dollars and cents do not count now, in these times, for they are the tightest that I have ever seen in the territory of Utah.\" === Involvement of church leaders === In September 1856, as the drought continued, the trials and difficulties of the previous year led to an explosion of intense soul-searching. Church leaders had viewed the economic disasters of the previous years as acts of God, and sensed that something was needed to assist the Saints in their quest for temporal survival and spiritual salvation. Brigham Young, at a church meeting on September 21, 1856, stated: \"We need a reformation in the midst of this people; we need a thorough reform.\"Jedediah M. Grant, a counselor in the First Presidency and a well-known conservative voice, took interest in the cause. He has been described by contemporary authors as being sensible, generous, well-educated, and given to robust oratory, all of which aided the Reformation. At a quarterly conference in Kaysville, Utah, Grant and Joseph Young of the First Council of the Seventy delivered various sermons over the span of four days, calling for repentance and a general recommitment to moral living and religious teachings. Five hundred people presented themselves for rebaptism as a symbol of their determination to reform their lives. The zealous message spread from Kaysville to surrounding Mormon communities. Church leaders traveled around the territory, expressing their concern about signs of spiritual decay and \"backsliding\", and calling for repentance. Members were asked to seal their rededication with rebaptism, and a new baptismal font was dedicated on the east side of the Endowment House on Temple Square for the purpose of rebaptism. Rebaptism as a practice was not unique to the Reformation, and the practice, which had begun in the 1830s, continued to be commonplace throughout the nineteenth century. It was later discouraged by the First Presidency in 1879.The meetings conducted by Grant and Young during the Reformation were similar to those held during the 1830s when the saints resided in Ohio, contained the same types of religious experiences. These types of manifestations, however, had largely been absent from the Nauvoo and earlier Utah experiences, such as speaking in tongues, prophesying, and seeing visions. The Reformation was endorsed by all three members of the First Presidency, as well as several apostles, who gave fiery sermons in favor of greater orthodoxy, and rebaptism in preparation for the full practice of \"celestial law\" in Utah Territory prior to the Second Coming, which they suspected would be soon. Brigham Young played a key role in the circulation of the Mormon Reformation with his emphasis on plural marriage, rebaptism, and passionate preaching and oration. He also introduced various controversial doctrines, such as blood atonement and the Adam-God doctrine, both of which were rejected by other church leaders. According to Brigham Young: \"The time is coming when justice will be laid to the line and righteousness to the plummet; when we shall take the old broadsword and ask, Are you for God? And if you are not heartily on the Lord\\'s side, you will be hewn down.\"By the end of September of 1856, the Reformation had gained enough momentum to carry it to the rest of the Mormon settlements. Throughout the winter, special meetings were held, and church members urged each other to adhere to the commandments of God and the practices and precepts of the church. Preaching placed special emphasis on the practice of plural marriage, adherence to the Word of Wisdom, attendance at church meetings, and personal prayer. Various sermons also focused on improving personal appearance, dress, and hygiene. In one sermon, Jedediah Grant urged members to uphold their baptismal covenants through \"observing cleanliness in their persons and dwellings, setting their families in order, [and] carefully cultivating their farms and gardens...\" Although Grant died of pneumonia in December 1856 at age forty, shortly after one of his winter tours, the influence of the Reformation spread throughout the Mormon colonies and settlements. On December 30, 1856, the entire all-Mormon Utah territorial legislature was rebaptized for the remission of their sins, and reconfirmed under the hands of the Twelve Apostles.To encourage reformation, certain adjunct theocratic committees may have attempted to ensure order and conformity by censuring local troublemakers. Dissident Mormons of the time reported rumors that committees resorted to summary judgments with punishments meted out by enforcers colloquially termed \"Danites\" or \"destroying angels\". For example, the southern Utah pioneer and militia scout of the time John Chatterley later wrote that he had received threats from \"secret Committee, called... \\'destroying angels\\'\" in late 1856 and early 1857. Contemporary commentators have pointed to pronouncements during the period by Brigham Young and Jedediah Grant that would seem to give vigilante-style bloodshed a religious basis. Young denied that any such acts were condoned by him or the church leadership. In a speech in 1867 Young said: Is there war in our religion? No; neither war nor bloodshed. Yet our enemies cry out \"bloodshed,\" and \"oh, what dreadful men these Mormons are, and those Danites! how they slay and kill!\" Such is all nonsense and folly in the extreme. The wicked slay the wicked, and they will lay it on the Saints. The Reformation also had an effect on the culture and society that had begun to develop among the Mormon community in Utah, due in large part to the Polysophical Society, which had been organized in 1854 by Lorenzo Snow and his sister, Eliza R. Snow. The society promoted large-scale public education through lectures, musical presentations, literature readings, and poetry writing. At the beginning of the Reformation, Jedediah M. Grant and Heber C. Kimball attacked the society, with Grant saying that it possessed an \"adulterous spirit\". In a possible tongue-in-cheek diary entry, Hannah Tapfield King responded to Grant\\'s. King wrote, \"Well, there may be, for he says there is, and probably he understands it. To me it all seemed good and nice, of course a little vanity and folly, and that one sees in the tabernacle and everywhere.\"Historian Dean L. May noted that the more zealous reformation efforts were not universally accepted in Utah. As in similar American religious reformation and revival movements, the enormous enthusiasm and dramatic signs of repentance could not be sustained. By the spring of 1857, with the return of more familiar spring rains, the religious life of Mormon communities returned to a more normal pattern. The Reformation appeared to have ended completely by early 1858. == Blood atonement == Several sermons by Willard Richards and George A. Smith that had been delivered earlier in the history of the LDS Church had touched on the concept of blood atonement. The idea of blood atonement was that apostates and those who committed certain sins, such as murder, were beyond the saving power of the blood of Christ and could be redeemed only by the voluntary shedding of their own blood. In a sermon given in March of 1856, just before the start of the Reformation, Brigham Young preached that the death and Atonement of Jesus Christ could not cleanse endowed members of the church of certain transgressions, such as adultery, apostasy, and first-degree murder. For these offenses, Young believed that only the voluntary offering of the sinner\\'s own life would be able to expunge the sin. On September 21, 1856, while calling for sincere repentance by church members, Brigham Young took the idea further, stating: \"I know that there are transgressors, who, if they knew themselves and the only condition upon which they can obtain forgiveness, would beg of their brethren to shed their blood, that the smoke might ascend to God as an offering to appease the wrath that is kindled against them, and that the law might have its course.\"Young reiterated the concept in several other sermons during the Reformation period. Although the belief was never widely accepted by church members, it became part of the public image of the church at the time and was pilloried, along with the practice of polygamy, in newspapers in the Eastern United States. During the subsequent history of the church, the concept was frequently criticized by church members, given that both the Book of Mormon and church doctrine teach that the sacrifice of Christ forms part of an \"infinite atonement\". Blood atonement was formally repudiated as church doctrine by a manifesto published in the Deseret Weekly in 1889, and again by a letter published by apostle Bruce R. McConkie speaking on behalf of the First Presidency in 1978. == Impact == In addition to the Reformation\\'s appeal to the spiritual and emotional lives of Latter-day Saints, actions taken during the movement had lasting impacts on church members, their families, and the church organization. Among the main outcomes of the Reformation were personal recommitment, communal economic innovation, strengthened unity among church members, and an increase in the number of those entering plural marriage. Gustive O. Larson writes that \"Mormonism was a civilizing force at work in the Great Basin. Not unlike the experience of some other Christian communities, it threshed its harvest of converts vigorously, lost some of them together with the tares, but produced thereby a better product. The call to repentance in the Reformation was generally heeded and as a result, in the words of historian Andrew Neff, \\'the spiritual tone of the entire Mormon commonwealth was markedly raised.\\'\"According to historian Paul H. Peterson, the pledges of conformity with church practices led to a measurable increase in plural marriages throughout the Mormon region. Many men who had previously resisted plural marriages were sealed to one or more plural wives. Stanley S. Ivins\\'s statistical research reveals that the number of plural marriages in relation to population was 65 percent higher in 1856–57 than in any other two-year period in Utah history.The Reformation also resulted in an increase in practical and emotional unity among church members. Historians James Allen and Glen Leonard point out that the Reformation \"may have accounted for the fact that the following year the Saints were emotionally prepared to confront the army of the United States en route to Utah.\" During the conflict, known as the Utah War, Mormon militia were asked to engage in diversionary action on the plains and in Wyoming. Also, church members were prepared, under Brigham Young\\'s direction, to abandon and destroy their homes, farms, and businesses and move again to the White Mountains of Arizona, which Young had selected as a possible place of refuge if full-scale war were to begin. Historians have also asserted that the emotional rhetoric of church leaders contributed to the defensive dialogue and actions in Southern Utah, which ultimately burst forth in the Mountain Meadows massacre.Additionally, leaders at church headquarters established a policy of assigning two \"home\" or ward missionaries in each congregational unit. A similar program still exists today within the LDS Church in the form of ministering (formerly known as visiting or home teaching), though much has changed since the Reformation. Ward missionaries were asked to visit each family in the ward, assess their material needs, and provide help wherever possible. They were also asked to inquire into family members\\' spiritual commitment, including asking searching questions about religious practices. After some months of these missionary visits, Latter-day Saints in Salt Lake City and surrounding communities who had not yet been rebaptized were asked to do so as an expression of their ongoing commitment to the church. Paul H. Peterson asserts that those who refused to be rebaptized might \"lose their membership in the church. In Britain, zealous application of Reformation principles resulted in trimming from church rolls a large number of the less-committed.\" A modest number of less zealous church members left the Utah area, returning to the east or traveling on to California. == See also == History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Morrisite War == Notes == == Further reading == Grant, Jedediah M.

              " 'Alexander Williamson Dobbie (12 November 1843 – 18 July 1912) was a Scots-born South Australian brassfounder, engineer, inventor, lecturer, mesmerist, businessman and travel writer. He founded A. W. Dobbie & Co. manufacturing company, and the hardware and homewares store Dobbie\\'s, which continued into the 1960s in Adelaide and the 1930s in Perth, Western Australia. == History == Alexander Williamson Dobbie was born in Glasgow, a son of William Dobbie (1813 – 12 January 1879), jeweller and engraver, and his wife Sophia Monteith Dobbie (c. 1817 – 9 September 1884). Alex was schooled at James Bath\\'s school in North Adelaide, then at age 14, after a few months as a draper\\'s assistant, was in 1858 apprenticed to machinist and brassfounder G. Schwan, formerly of Berends & Schwan, of Gawler Place, 3 doors from Rundle street, who went out of business in 1860. It is likely that he completed his apprenticeship with, and worked for, another brassfounder, perhaps Richard Hutchinson. At age 19 began working on his own account, in premises on Gawler Place. === Parents and siblings === Thomas Dobbie and William Dobbie and their families arrived on 5 March 1851 at Port Adelaide on the Three Bells, an iron ship of 640 tons from Glasgow.The Scots born children of William Dobbie and his wife Sophia Monteith Dobbie née Minto were: Thomas Dobbie (9 June 1836 – 19 December 1886) married Matilda Louisa Barns née Ladd (1859 – 1938), daughter of J. O. Ladd, on 31 May 1884 John Forgie Dobbie (c. 1837 – 13 November 1870 in New Zealand) William Dobbie, jr., (c. 1835 – 28 April 1908) married Janet James (c. 1843–1932) in Melbourne on 19 January 1866 Alexander Williamson Dobbie (1843–1912) James Dobbie (1846–1879)five more children were born in South Australia: Grace Gardner Dobbie (1851– ) married Henry John Thompson on 10 April 1873, Robert Tulloch Dobbie (1853 – c. 21 August 1919) married Anne Frood Cornish \"Annie\" Champion ( –1909) on 22 November 1877 Francis Dobbie (1857– ) Henry (8 January 1862 – 1867) married Louisa Emma Strother in 1895 Alice Maud Dobbie (26 November 1867 – )William Dobbie Sr., was a partner with John Wald in Wald & Dobbie, watchmakers & jewellers of 83 Rundle Street, 1865–1866, then sole trading jeweller of Gawler Place. He died at his home in Charles Street, Norwood on 12 January 1879 and James died at his home in West Street, Unley on 10 December 1879. Advertisements in the name of A. & J. Dobbie continued to appear well into the next decade. === Manufacturing === In July 1864 he moved to premises \"adjacent to Padman & Co.\", Gawler Place. His company won a silver medal at the Exhibition held in conjunction with Prince Alfred\\'s visit in 1867. The articles exhibited included the brass level used by the Prince in laying the foundation stone for the Victoria Tower, and a pair of \"transit Y\"s used by Charles Todd in his role as Government Astronomer. The company began electro-plating around 1870. The business suffered two serious incidents that could have had tragic consequences: Their apparatus used for generating the oxygen needed for high-temperature welding was a retort charged with potassium chlorate and manganese dioxide as a catalyst. This is a time-honored and inexpensive way of producing oxygen but critically relies on purity of the reagents concerned. One day in July 1866, the catalyst must have been contaminated, perhaps with graphite or antimony, as the apparatus exploded, blowing out part of a wall, the ceiling, doors and a window. Fortunately no-one was in the workshop at the time, as serious injury or death would have been almost certain. In January 1874 a fire broke out in the foundry, and all the irreplaceable patterns were destroyed, but by prompt action by the fire department, the fire did not spread to the rest of the building or those adjacent.Among the articles cast by Dobbie was a set of handbells, to patterns made by George Marshall of Waymouth Street. Also produced in the factory were highly-finished brass \"church furniture\": crosses, candlesticks, vases, alms dishes and lecterns. During a visit to the United States at the time of the 1876 Philadelphia Exposition, Alex Dobbie became an enthusiast for their technology, with the result that the Gawler Place shop began advertising a diverse range of American \"tools, novelties and general machinery\".They began developing and manufacturing farm machinery with a patented broadcast seed-sower, and took out patents for improvements to pumps and chaffcutters in 1877. Having absorbed the principles behind the invention of the telephone, he developed similar instruments which he and Charles Todd demonstrated at an Adelaide Philosophical Society exhibition at the Adelaide Town Hall in 1878.In 1876 he was involved in the process of standardizing hose couplings used by fire brigades throughout South Australia.In 1885 he erected a new two-storey building behind the showroom in Gawler Place, and a new foundry building on the Pirie Street corner, just in time to satisfy a major Government contract in connection with an expansion of Adelaide\\'s water reticulation system.Dobbie & Co. began manufacturing their own \"Standard\" brand of bicycle around 1895, and carried several other brands of US and UK manufacture. === Business and retail === His manufacturing business was profitable, but it was the sale of goods imported from Britain and, especially, America that made him wealthy. In 1868 he began advertising sewing machine repairs along with brassfounding and electroplating, and later became an sales outlet for several manufacturers. In 1871 he founded the \"Adelaide Sewing Machine Depot\", and in July 1872 erected new showrooms and workshop, with 25 different makers\\' machines on display.Alex\\'s younger brother James, who had training as a machinist (perhaps with A. Simpson & Son), joined the firm some time before August 1873. James Williamson Dobbie (12 January 1846 – 10 December 1879) married Sarah Elizabeth Revell ( – 1933) on 26 December 1867. They were to have five children: Alfred Simpson Dobbie (11 June 1870 – ), Edgar Allan Dobbie (15 July 1871 – 1934), Florence Edith Dobbie (1873–) married Robert William Tayler in 1896, Horace Leeson Dobbie (3 July 1874 – ), Walter Campbell Dobbie (18 July 1876 – 1947) married Edith Rosalie Wright in 1903, and Elsie Revell Dobbie (5 February 1878 – 26 June 1942) married Charles Basil Sheidow on 1 March 1913. She was a highly successful teacher.As A. & J. Dobbie, and \"Adelaide Sewing Machine Depot\" they sold and repaired various makes of sewing machine, also advertising revolvers and guns \"for the Northern Territory\", and \"brassfounding carried on as usual\".The shop in Gawler Place diversified even further, selling Swedish \"Domo\" cream separators, Zonophone gramophone records, American Mason & Hamlin organs and Chickering and the cheaper (German) Fritz Kuhla pianos, and much else. American Waterbury watches, English Brinsmead and German Neumeyer pianos, and Wertheim sewing machines were popular and profitable lines. In 1895 a branch of the company was established at 307–309, Hay Street east, in Perth, Western Australia, and in 1898 opened showrooms closer to the centre of town at 459 Hay Street, with agencies in Kalgoorlie, Fremantle and Bunbury. A grandiose new showroom at 580–582 Hay Street was opened in 1906. The Western Australian factory closed in the 1920s after adverse rulings on tradesmen\\'s and apprentices\\' pay, and retail operations were taken over by Arthur W. Lushey in 1932.Around 1903 the firm was restructured as a private company jointly owned by Alexander Williamson Dobbie, James Edward Molloy Morley, Alexander Herbert Dobbie and Hector John Dobbie. Hector died in 1906 and the partnership was dissolved in December 1910. === Other interests === His home in College Park was well known for its profusion of mechanical and scientific gadgets and curiosities, and his garden, where he grew an abundance of prize-winning flowers. He was a prominent member of the Royal Agricultural Society, Photographic Society (vice president in 1895 and president in 1896 and 1897), League of the Empire, Adelaide Philosophical Society, Adelaide Benevolent and Strangers\\' Friend Society, Royal Geographical Society, Chamber of Manufactures, director of Broken Hill Proprietary, and from age 18 an adherent of the Wesleyan Methodist church and a Sunday School superintendent for 10 years, latterly at the Kent Town church. A proud Scotsman, he was a founding member of the Royal Caledonian Society of South Australia.He was member of the General Committee and the Executive of both Prince Alfred College and the Methodist Ladies\\' College.Largely self-educated, he was by some dubbed \"Adelaide\\'s Edison\" for his inventiveness, absorption in his work, and his absent-mindedness. Influenced by his friend and kindred spirit D. B. Adamson, he took a great interest in astronomy. He built several telescopes from instructions found in English Mechanic magazine. His first, completed in 1874, had a 6.5 inches (17 cm) (glass, not speculum metal) reflector, and his second, which took 11 years to complete, had a 12.5 inches (32 cm) diameter reflector, the largest privately owned telescope in Australia. He ground and silvered (to a method expounded by John Browning) the mirror himself, and cast and turned the mount and all the mechanism, all in brass of course. In 1895 he demonstrated projection of stereoscopic images using red and green filters on the two oxy-hydrogen projectors. The following year he demonstrated X-ray photography in conjunction with Professor W. H. Bragg. He experimented with the \"audiphone\", by which some deaf persons were able to hear by amplified sound being transmitted through the teeth.He gave many lectures on scientific and occult subjects and gave demonstrations on hypnosis, or mesmerism, which he treated seriously rather than as a stage act. He was an expert hypnotist, and on several occasions demonstrated its use in dentistry. He was particularly interested in the phenomenon of clairvoyance apparently exhibited by hypnotised subjects.He undertook at least two world tours, in 1876 and 1888 or 1889, the subjects of two books, each titled Rough Notes of a Traveller . . .. He also toured India in 1893–1894 and New Guinea and South Pacific islands in 1899. During this latter trip he contracted malaria, from which he never fully recovered.He was one of a party sent by the Royal Astronomical Society under G. F. Dodwell to Bruni Island, off Tasmania, to document the total solar eclipse of 9 May 1910, when the period of totality was over 3 minutes. Dobbie used his 12-inch and 6-inch reflectors with special long focal-length cameras to record the sun\\'s coronas, a subject of intense interest. === Later history === Alexander Williamson Dobbie died at his residence, \"Rothesay Villa\", Baliol Street, College Park.Alexander Herbert Dobbie (25 July 1875 – 1965) took over the firm as managing director. He was a member of Chamber of Manufactures (vice-president in 1925), on the board of the Advisory Council of Education 1920, the State Advisory Council of Science and Industry, and a prominent member of the East Adelaide Lawn Tennis Club. He retired as chairman of directors in 1951. Later manufactures include a range of spraying equipment and irrigation fittings. \"Dobbie Dico Meter Co. Ltd\" was founded in 1935 or earlier, with premises in Sultram Place, off Sturt Street, Adelaide, making water meters, many of which may still be seen on South Australian properties. The retail store in Gawler Place was incorporated into the Savery group of companies but continued to trade independently into the 1960s.In 1940 A. H. Dobbie and William \"Bill\" Bardon ( – October 1972) established \"Dobbie Dico Meter Co.\" (DDMC) a brass foundry in Wittenoom Street, East Perth to manufacture water meters for the Western Australian market, and also had useful contracts with the US Navy dockyards in WA during World War II and later. In 1952 the company acquired the nearby company of Kay & Heron, an iron and steel foundry. By this time the company was \"Dobbie\" in name only. In 1961 Dobbie Dico began manufacture of \"Eclipse\" brand fire extinguishers and other fire protection products. With his death, Bill\\'s son Stan Bardon ( – 2004) took over the company and in March 1998, with the expansion of suburban Perth, they moved to new larger premises at 430 Victoria Road, Málaga, some 10 km north of Perth\\'s CBD, where they continue to this day under Stan Bardon\\'s son Phil Bardon, manufacturing civil water engineering products. == Family == Alexander Dobbie married Esther Catherine Elizabeth Wallis (c. 1845 – 10 October 1925) on 6 June 1865. Their family included: Sarah Grace Dobbie (3 November 1867 – 1935) married Richard Sutton on 10 April 1892 Alexander Herbert Dobbie (25 July 1875 – 1965) married Florence Colebatch ( –1950) on 16 April 1902. He and John H. M. Hawkes were in October 1921 appointed to the State Advisory Council on Science and Industry. Hector John Dobbie (20 October 1879 – 20 April 1906) educated at Prince Alfred College and the School of Mines, named as co-inventor on several patents, he was dying of tuberculosis when he cut his own throat. Emilie Sophia Dobbie (7 January 1882 – 4 November 1914) married Lloyd Mervyn Hodge ( – ) on 30 August 1909 Leonard Campbell Dobbie (24 March 1884 – ), farmer and orchardist, married Natalie Lucy Barritt (died 1951) on 27 August 1908, lived at Tawah and Degilbo, near Biggenden then Cottonvale and retired to Mount Tamborine, Queensland.

              " 'Thomas Bang (born 6 September 1938) is a Danish sculptor who in the 1970s contributed to Conceptual art and Pop art in the United States. == Biography == Born in Copenhagen, as a young man Bang became interested in Surrealism as practised by Giorgio de Chirico, Max Ernst and Yves Tanguy. After he moved to the United States with his parents, he studied art at the University of Cincinnati (1958–59), the Cleveland Institute of Art (1959–61), Yale University (1961–62), and the University of Southern California (1962–64). He soon became part of the American experimental art scene which covered Minimal Art, Conceptual Art and Pop Art. He exhibited with pioneers in the field including Carl André, Richard Serra, Jasper Johns, Frank Stella, Sol LeWitt and Bruce Nauman.Working in an existentialist approach with modest materials, the fragment is a recurring theme and concepts include construction and destruction, open and closed, covering and uncovering, structure and process. His work has addressed the potential of the object, representing absurd perceptions of dissonance in our attempts to achieve harmony between ourselves and our surroundings. From the late 1960s, three-dimensional objects cover transitions from painting to free-standing works. He exhibited them in the United States in leading museums together with other pioneers such as Robert Morris, Eva Hesse and Joel Shapiro. By the 1970s, he was producing long square-shaped plaster objects standing on the floor or up against the walls which contained covered or partly covered rolls of steel wire. In the 1980s, his works became more complex while in the 1990s he worked in larger formats, creating mainly wooden objects adorned with metal, wax and paint, sometimes with additional strips of plastic or cloth.Bang had a professorship at the University of Rochester in New York State from 1970 to 1991. He has exhibited widely in the United States, Germany and Denmark. His work can be seen in collections in Europe and the United States. == Awards == In 1990, Bang was awarded the Eckersberg Medal and, in 2000, the Thorvaldsen Medal. == References == == External links == Illustrated portrait of Thomas Bang (in Danish) from KunstOnline Illustrated list of works by Thomas Bang in Danish museums from Kunstindeks Danmark',\n",

              " 'Gloger\\'s rule is an ecogeographical rule which states that within a species of endotherms, more heavily pigmented forms tend to be found in more humid environments, e.g. near the equator. It was named after the zoologist Constantin Wilhelm Lambert Gloger, who first remarked upon this phenomenon in 1833 in a review of covariation of climate and avian plumage color. Erwin Stresemann later noted that the idea had been expressed even earlier by Peter Simon Pallas in Zoographia Rosso-Asiatica (1811). Gloger found that birds in more humid habitats tended to be darker than their relatives from regions with higher aridity. Over 90% of 52 North American bird species studies conform to this rule.One explanation of Gloger\\'s rule in the case of birds appears to be the increased resistance of dark feathers to feather- or hair-degrading bacteria such as Bacillus licheniformis. Feathers in humid environments have a greater bacterial load, and humid environments are more suitable for microbial growth; dark feathers or hair are more difficult to break down. More resilient eumelanins (dark brown to black) are deposited in hot and humid regions, whereas in arid regions, pheomelanins (reddish to sandy color) predominate due to the benefit of crypsis. Among mammals, there is a marked tendency in equatorial and tropical regions to have a darker skin color than poleward relatives. In this case, the underlying cause is probably the need to better protect against the more intense solar UV radiation at lower latitudes. However, absorption of a certain amount of UV radiation is necessary for the production of certain vitamins, notably vitamin D (see also osteomalacia). Gloger\\'s rule is also vividly demonstrated among human populations. Populations that evolved in sunnier environments closer to the equator tend to be darker-pigmented than populations originating farther from the equator. There are exceptions, however; among the most well known are the Tibetans and Inuit, who have darker skin than might be expected from their native latitudes. In the first case, this is apparently an adaptation to the extremely high UV radiation on the Tibetan Plateau, whereas in the second case, the necessity to absorb UV radiation is alleviated by the Inuit\\'s diet, which is naturally rich in vitamin D. == See also == Allen\\'s rule Bergmann\\'s rule – correlating latitude with body mass in animals == References == == Further reading == Burtt, Edward H.

This was the only time Disney Channel content aired on over-the-air television. The block regularly aired on Saturday mornings, though certain programs within the lineup aired on Sundays in some parts of the country due to station preferences for non-educational programming or scheduling issues with regional or network sports broadcasts. After five years of mainly repeats of programs introduced onto the block prior to the 2007–08 season, ABC decided it would cease to provide children\\'s programming during the Saturday morning timeslot, and entered into an agreement with Litton Entertainment to program that period; the block that resulted from this deal – Litton\\'s Weekend Adventure, which is structured as a syndication package distributed with virtual exclusivity to ABC\\'s owned-and-operated stations and affiliates – replaced ABC Kids on September 3, 2011. == History == === Disney\\'s One Saturday Morning === Immediately after The Walt Disney Company purchased ABC corporate parent Capital Cities/ABC Inc. in 1996, the network\\'s children\\'s program block ABC Saturday Morning, aired such Disney-produced series as The Mighty Ducks, Jungle Cubs and Gargoyles; it was one of two networks at the time that prominently carried Disney programming on Saturday mornings, as CBS also carried Disney cartoons (CBS\\' were mostly television spin-offs of Disney Renaissance films, whereas ABC\\'s were mostly other Disney properties). After Disney formally took over ABC\\'s operations, Disney head Michael Eisner sought to create a Saturday morning block that was different from those carried by its competitors at the time. In February 1997, Peter Hastings left Warner Bros. Animation and joined Disney, where he was tasked with overhauling ABC\\'s Saturday morning lineup in order to compete against Fox Kids and Kids\\' WB. He pitched an idea around the concept that Saturday is different from every other day of the week, and the representation of weekdays as buildings. Hastings also proposed the use of virtual set technology; although he knew a bit about it at the time and the technology used was just starting to be developed, Disney and ABC liked the idea. He hired Prudence Fenton as consultant manager and co-executive producer. Together, they sampled virtual set technology at the 1997 NAB Show and chose technology developed by Accom and ELSET. Rutherford Bench Productions, which had previously worked with Disney on other projects, hired Pacific Ocean Post (now POP Sound) to produce the virtual set. The building was initially a drawing of Grand Central Terminal with a roller coaster added but evolved into a towering mechanical structure. Even the interior has similarities such as a central high raised room, with two wings on the left and right sides and another on the south side.On September 13, 1997, Disney\\'s One Saturday Morning premiered as a two-hour sub-block within the ABC Saturday Morning lineup. It was originally scheduled to debut the Saturday prior on September 6, but coverage by all U.S. networks of the funeral of Princess Diana pushed back the premiere up one week to September 13. Disney’s One Saturday Morning featured two parts: three hours of regularly scheduled cartoons and a two-hour flagship show that included feature segments, comedy skits, and the virtual world which Hastings had proposed, along with newer episodes of three animated series: Doug (which had been acquired from Nickelodeon in 1996), Recess and Pepper Ann. Doug, Recess and Pepper Ann were each nominally given 40-minute time slots. The extended 10 minutes during each show\\'s slot were for One Saturday Morning\\'s interstitial segments and educational features. The live-action wraparound segments were originally hosted by Charlie (portrayed by Jessica Prunell) for the block\\'s first season in 1997, and later by MeMe (Valarie Rae Miller) beginning in September 1998; the segments also featured an elephant named Jelly Roll (voiced by stand up comedian and actor Brad Garrett), who served as a sidekick to the human host. Schoolhouse Rock!, a longtime essential of ABC\\'s Saturday morning block since 1973, also aired as an interstitial segment during The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show, the only non-Disney cartoon to carry into the block and one that would air until 2000, when the carriage contract with Warner Bros. was exhausted. Disney’s One Saturday Morning was initially a massive success, beating Fox Kids during its first season to be the most-watched Saturday morning block on broadcast television. It remained competitive in its second season, beating all of Fox Kids\\' shows except Power Rangers. The block received a new brand identity in the fall of 2000; this was followed by the shorts and hosted segments being discontinued on December 16 in a reformatting of the ABC block. By this time, the interstitials within the block were relegated to bumpers and program promotions. In the fall of 2001, live-action series were added to the One Saturday Morning lineup with the addition of the \"Zoog Hour,\" an hour-long sub-block featuring the Disney Channel original series Lizzie McGuire and Even Stevens (the sub-block, advertised in promos for Disney’s One Saturday Morning promoting the two programs as \"powered by Zoog,\" was named after Disney Channel\\'s weekend programming block at the time, Zoog Disney). A spin-off of Disney\\'s One Saturday Morning, Disney\\'s One Too, debuted on UPN on September 6, 1999; produced through a time-lease agreement between Disney and UPN, the block aired each weekday (either in the morning or afternoon, depending on the station\\'s preference) and on Sunday mornings, and featured many of the programs shown on One Saturday Morning (including Recess, Pepper Ann and Sabrina: The Animated Series). === ABC Kids === On July 23, 2001, the Walt Disney Company purchased Fox Family Worldwide, primarily for its Fox Family Channel, which was included in the sale as well as Saban Entertainment, a company in which Fox purchased a 50% interest in 1994. On September 14, 2002, ABC rebranded its Saturday morning block, as a subtle nod to the Fox Kids brand acquired by Disney through its purchase of Fox Family Worldwide, to ABC Kids (as a result of the sale, Fox Kids ceased to exist; Fox\\'s children\\'s program lineups would be handled from that point onward by 4Kids Entertainment until 2008).The rechristened block originally contained a mix of first-run programs exclusive to the block, as well as reruns of several original series from both Disney Channel and Toon Disney. NBA Inside Stuff also began airing on the block as a result of ABC\\'s acquisition of the broadcast television rights to the NBA from NBC (where the series originally premiered in 1992), beginning with the 2002–03 season\\'s Christmas Day game; Inside Stuff continued to air on ABC Kids until 2004. The new block abandoned the imagery of the One Saturday Morning era in favor of a sports motif, which remained throughout the ABC Kids era. Through Disney\\'s acquisition of Saban Entertainment, ABC also moved the Power Rangers series from Fox Kids to the ABC Kids block. All first-run episodes from the franchise premiered on ABC Kids beginning with the second half of the show\\'s Wild Force season (starting with the episode \"Unfinished Business\"), with the entirety of the Wild Force and Ninja Storm seasons subsequently airing in reruns on ABC Family (the former season aired in part both before the introduction of and during the ABC Family Action Block). However, when Toon Disney and ABC Family jointly launched the action-oriented Jetix block in 2004, Jetix handled all first-run episode debuts of subsequent seasons from Dino Thunder to Jungle Fury, while ABC Kids aired these seasons in reruns. Due to the merger between Jetix and Toon Disney to form Disney XD in 2009, the RPM season aired exclusively on ABC Kids, after which ABC canceled production of the series. Instead of producing a new season, ABC aired a re-version of the first 32 episodes of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, which included a new logo, an updated title sequence, comic book-referenced graphics, and extra alternative visual effects. The re-version aired from January 2 to August 28, 2010, after which Nickelodeon acquired rights to the franchise. In the 2004–05 season, ABC Kids dropped its two remaining original series, Fillmore! and Recess (the latter of which was airing in reruns on the block since it ended in 2001). With the expanded regulation of federally mandated educational programming guidelines defined by the Federal Communications Commission\\'s Children\\'s Television Act, and the debut of Good Morning America Weekend that fall (rival network NBC later noted that morning news shows caused a major viewership clash with cartoons, and ABC was the last of the Big Three networks to add a Saturday morning newscast), ABC chose to fulfill the three-hour quota by carrying select episodes of Disney Channel live-action comedies and animated series (anywhere between 9 and 13 episodes from a given season) featuring moral lessons and/or educational anecdotes. The episodes were selected by both the Standards and Practices Division of the network and any educational consultants who were attached to the shows. The Emperor\\'s New School, The Replacements and Hannah Montana were the last Disney Channel series to be added to the block in 2006. Beginning with the 2007–08 season, ABC Kids programming (with the exception of Power Rangers) was fully automated, putting the same handful of episodes of each show (The Emperor\\'s New School, The Replacements, That\\'s So Raven, Hannah Montana and The Suite Life of Zack & Cody) on a permanent rotation for the block\\'s remaining four years. === The closure of ABC Kids === In March 2010, ABC decided to stop providing a three-hour block of E/I-compliant, repurposed Disney Channel programming sent to its own stations and ABC affiliates. The network chose to lease out the three-hour time slot and seek other programmers for an agreement to produce a syndicated block, not for the network, but for each ABC station as the network was turning the E/I responsibility back to local ABC stations. In April 2010, ABC\\'s affiliate board announced that it had reached a deal with Litton Entertainment, a production company which produces syndicated programming (including educational programs aimed at children and teenagers), to produce six, all-new, original half-hour E/I series exclusively for ABC stations for the 2011–12 season.The block aired for the final time on August 27, 2011 without any announcement of its closure, and was quietly replaced by Litton\\'s Weekend Adventure the following week on September 3, 2011. As a result, ABC discontinued airing animated programming, making it the first network not to air animated series within its children\\'s program lineup since August 1992, when NBC discontinued its animation block on Saturday mornings to launch the live-action block TNBC. == Programming == Note: Every show that premiered before September 14, 2002 aired during the One Saturday Morning era. 1 Indicates that the program also ran on syndication or ABC prior to the block. 2 Indicates that the program moved to Toon Disney for its episode premieres. 3 Indicates that the program also aired under the Jetix brand. === Final programming === === Former programming === == See also == The Disney Afternoon – a Disney-produced syndicated children\\'s program block that ran from 1990 to 1997.

Robertson, and at universities in Italy (beginning with support from a Fulbright Fellowship, 1978), especially the scholarly circle around Giuseppe Billanovich at the Catholic University of Milan. It was as a visiting scholar at Milan that he completed his study of the post-classical interpretations of Statius\\' epic poem Thebaid and their influence on Boccaccio and Chaucer, published as Before the Knight\\'s Tale (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1988), and identified in scattered manuscript sources a previously unrecognized commentary that was shown to be present in Boccaccio\\'s library and used by that author in his works: \"Boccaccio\\'s Glosses on Statius,\" Studi sul Boccaccio (1996). At the University of Pennsylvania (1980–1988), he was the first male member of the faculty to take an extended parenting leave. At the time, the request was unusual, and his act occasioned public discussion of gender bias in employment policies and was the subject of a front-page article in the Daily Pennsylvanian, \"Mr. Mom: Paternity Leave Allows English Prof to Raise Son\". In 1986 he curated an exhibition and catalogue of manuscripts and early printed books illustrating Chaucer\\'s works and their cultural influences, Sixty Books Old and New (New Chaucer Society, 1986). The exhibition was held at the University of Pennsylvania and the Rosenbach Foundation and was supported by several Philadelphia-area charitable organizations, which made possible the distribution of copies of the catalogue to English teachers in the Philadelphia public school district.

              " 'Margaret Isobel Fulton (6 October 1924 – 24 July 2019) was a Scottish-born Australian food and cooking writer, journalist, author and commentator. She was the first of this genre of writers in Australia.Fulton\\'s early recipes encouraged Australians to alter their traditional staple of \"meat and three vegetables\" and to be creative with food. She encouraged international cuisine from places such as Spain, Italy, India and China. As the cookery editor of the Woman\\'s Day magazine, she \"brought these into Australian homes through her articles.\"Although she did some television work, Fulton mainly concentrated on writing, because she felt it was her higher talent. == Early life and career == Fulton was born in Nairn in the Scottish Highlands on 6 October 1924. When she was three, her parents emigrated to Australia, settling in Glen Innes, New South Wales. She was a Girl Guide as a child and leader of the Magpie Patrol in Glen Innes. In her time as a Guide she learned to cook over a campfire.She began as a cooking teacher at the Overseas Corporation in 1947 and was later promoted to sales manager. She was \"partially responsible for the introduction of the pressure cooker to Australia\".In 1954, Fulton, then a \"home economist for a leading firm of cereal manufacturers\", gave a talk on \"cooking with ready-to-eat cereals\". She told the audience that \"with more wives and mothers working, speed and ease in food preparation is a \\'must\\'\". She continued, \"Many women have no training in homemaking, and packaged and ready-prepared foods, like cereals, cake, pastry and biscuit mixes, canned and frozen foods, make life easier\". A selection of \"hot muffins made with bran\" were handed out, and Fulton told the listeners that \"These are quick and easy to make and most economical\".In 1956, over four days, Fulton provided French cooking demonstrations. Each day was organised with a different \"well-known French hostess, resident in Sydney\" who \"planned a menu, contributed the recipes, helped with the cooking, and arranged the table setting\".Fulton began to appear in advertisements in the late 1950s. She promoted Johnson\\'s Glo-coat floor polish and Johnson\\'s Pride surface polish from her \"well appointed Sydney kitchen\" in March 1957. Later that year readers of The Australian Women\\'s Weekly were told \"Margaret Fulton, expert Home Economist\" believed Sellotape \"is so dependable\" in a full-page colour advertisement, which also offered Fulton\\'s handy hints for using the product such as sealing plastic bags \"for deep-freezing foods\" and binding pot handles. In 1959, Fulton told readers she used Sellotape \"each week for sticking my hundreds of recipe clippings into reference books\".Prospective buyers of Woman\\'s Day magazine in July 1964 were promised an \"8-page liftout\" from Fulton, who was known for her Tuesday cookery class at Sydney\\'s Bistro. Her regular contributions continued throughout the decade with 1968\\'s lift-out full-colour recipe guide to Italian food, which was described by the magazine as \"our most exciting ... ever!\". == 1960s and 1970s == The Margaret Fulton Cookbook was published by Paul Hamlyn in 1968 and was an instant success. By 1978 it had sold \"more than two-thirds of a million copies\". She returned to the Italian theme with the publication of her Italian Cookbook in 1973. The Canberra Times said the recipes were \"simple, tested ... and where necessary adapted to suit the local scene\"; however, Fulton was \"able to add authenticity to the book by taking a trip to Italy and checking the fare at first hand\". The author was quoted as recommending that cooks \"look for the specialty ingredients in a good delicatessen or gourmet section of a large retail stores. Use only the best quality Italian olive oil and when using grating cheese like Parmesan or Romano, buy it in wedges and grate it as you need it.\"In October 1973, Fulton was appointed to the federal government\\'s Interim Commission on Consumer Standards, which was formed to \"reach as many groups as possible\" and \"find the areas where action\" on standards was \"most urgent\".Interviewed in 1975, Fulton provided Italian and Chinese-style recipes for readers. She included in her advice for \"young people setting up home for the first time\" that they should \"buy a couple of really good saucepans and, if possible, invest in an iron oven casserole ... they last a lifetime and these days are so attractive that they can be taken to the table\".Following on from the popularity of late 1970s BBC television drama series The Duchess of Duke Street, set in London between 1900 and 1925, Fulton had a primetime television cooking show of 5-minute episodes based on recipes from the era.In 1979, her interest in Chinese cuisine led to her leading a planned 23-day gourmet food tour, which would include \"the finest restaurants\" of Canton, Shanghai, Tsinan, Tsingtao, Kunming and Peking. Fulton said the tour would also visit \"historical sites... communes, universities, factories and handcraft institutes\". She also hoped there would be \"a chance to see acupuncture procedures in a Chinese hospital\". == Later life and influence == Fulton was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia in the 1983 Queen\\'s Birthday Honours \"In recognition of service to the media as a journalist and writer in the field of cookery\".Fulton\\'s encouragement of Chinese cuisine was recognised as a contributor to the development of Sydney\\'s Chinatown, where \"few non-Chinese\" had ventured \"before the 1950s\". Fulton was one of the writers who \"began serving up Chinese recipes to Menzies\\' Australia\" (recalling the era of Robert Menzies as prime minister from 1949 to 1966) and, as a result, Chinatown\\'s \"few eating houses were seen as a welcome alternative to the spartan cuisine of the times\".In 1998, Fulton was added to the list of 100 Australian Living Treasures by the National Trust of Australia. The same year, a packaged meals business venture \\'Margaret Fulton\\'s kitchen\\' failed. Fulton had been involved in it with \\'Sydney food luminary\\' Anders Ousback.In 2006, The Bulletin named Fulton in their list of \"The 100 most influential Australians\". In the citation they described her as someone who \"changed the way Australians ate at home\". She is, they wrote, \"Australia\\'s original domestic goddess. No cookery writer since can claim her blanket influence ... Fulton turned us into foodies.\"Interviewed by The Australian Women\\'s Weekly in 2009, Fulton said: Scarcely a week passes when I\\'m not invited to speak at a food industry or fundraising function and I always try to accept. At my age, being asked to pass on what I\\'ve learned is a pleasure and a privilege. In 2014 Fulton appeared on an Australian postage stamp as part of the \\'Australia Post Legends Awards\\'. Chef Neil Perry, Kylie Kwong, Stephanie Alexander and Maggie Beer also featured in the same stamp series.Fulton died on 24 July 2019 at the age of 94. No cause was given. On 30 July, the NSW Premier announced that Fulton\\'s family had been offered a State memorial service for Fulton, which the family accepted. == Family == Fulton had one daughter, Suzanne Gibbs, and two granddaughters, Kate Gibbs and Louise Keats, all of whom pursued careers in food. Kate Gibbs wrote two cookbooks and wrote a third book about Margaret\\'s life, titled \"Margaret and Me\".Louise Keats explored Fulton\\'s impact on her own childhood in her illustrated children\\'s storybook \"My Grandma\\'s Kitchen\". Fulton supported Keats\\' food career including by sending her to the Le Cordon Bleu school of cookery. Keats later studied nutrition at Deakin University and authored five more cookbooks, crediting Fulton for inspiring her passion for food and cooking. == Honours and awards == 1983 – Medal of the Order of Australia 1986 – \\'diploma of honour\\' from Comité Interprofessionnel du vin de Champagne == Bibliography == Fulton wrote many books, including: The Margaret Fulton Cookbook (various editions) Encyclopaedia of Food and Cookery == References == == External links == Official website Margaret Fulton at IMDb Australian Biography Online 1 May 2007, ABC call for \"Favourite Margaret Fulton Memory\"',\n",
              " 'Peter Phillips (born 15 October 1953) is a British choral conductor and musicologist. He was the founder of The Tallis Scholars in 1973 and of Gimell Records (with Steve Smith) in 1980. == Early life and education == Phillips was born in Southampton and educated at Winchester College (1967–71) and St John\\'s College, Oxford (Organ Scholar 1972–75). He studied music with Hugh Macdonald, Denis Arnold and David Wulstan. He subsequently taught at Oxford University, Trinity College of Music and the Royal College of Music in London (where he directed the Chamber Choir in succession to David Willcocks), but had resigned all these posts by 1988 in order to pursue a full-time career in conducting. == The Tallis Scholars == Phillips\\'s first concert with the Tallis Scholars took place in St Mary Magdalen\\'s Church, Oxford on 3 November 1973. The group was made up of choral scholars (hence the use of the word \\'Scholars\\' in the title) and layclerks from the leading Oxbridge choral foundations. From the start Phillips aimed to produce a distinctive sound, influenced by choirs he admired, in particular the Clerkes of Oxenford. However the repertoire he chose was idiosyncratic, based in his desire to explore neglected corners of the polyphonic repertories, continental as much as English. This first concert included music by Obrecht, Ockeghem and Lassus. After the foundation of Gimell Records in 1980, the Tallis Scholars have gone on to fill many gaps in the recording catalogue, making discs devoted to such relatively unknown composers as Obrecht, Ockeghem, Cardoso, White, Clemens, Gombert and Mouton. Since winning the Gramophone Record of the Year Award in 1987, the Tallis Scholars have been recognised as perhaps the world\\'s leading ensemble in interpreting renaissance polyphony. That 1987 disc inaugurated a career-long project of recording all of Josquin des Prez’s masses, ready for the 500th anniversary of the composer’s death, in 2021. The ninth and last disc in the series also won an Award entitled Record of the Year – from the BBC Music Magazine – in 2021, 34 years after the first one. Phillips first met the composer John Tavener in 1977, which led to a lifelong friendship. For many years Tavener was the only living composer to write for The Tallis Scholars, a connection which resulted in such masterpieces as the Ikon of Light, the Lords Prayer (1999), Let not the Prince be silent, Tribute to Cavafy and The Requiem Fragments. In more recent years Phillips has commissioned Eric Whitacre, Gabriel Jackson, Nico Muhly, Ivan Moody, John Woolrich, Matthew Martin, Christopher Willcock, Michael Nyman; and in 2014 made a disc entirely dedicated to Arvo Pärt\\'s tintinnabuli style. Phillips gave his first Promenade concert in 1988, since when he has appeared eight more times, always with the Tallis Scholars, though in 2007 also with the BBC Singers, when the two groups joined forces to give the first modern performance of Striggio\\'s 60-part Mass Ecco si beato giorno. Phillips and The Tallis Scholars appeared at the Proms on 4 August 2014 to help mark the exact anniversary of the outbreak of World War 1, with a Requiem written for them by John Tavener, televised on BBC 4. In 2018 they returned to the Albert Hall to sing a specially adapted Compline service. In 1990 Phillips was the subject of a South Bank Show, introduced by Melvyn Bragg. It followed the course of renaissance polyphony through England and the Netherlands and was entitled \"A Personal Odyssey\". In 2013 he directed the Tallis Scholars in a 99-concert year of events, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the group. Amongst other countries they visited New Zealand for the first time, Australia for the seventh time, Japan for the 14th time, and the US for the 61st. == Other conducting work == In 1985 Phillips was invited to conduct the Chapelle Royale of Paris (by Philippe Herreweghe), and the Netherlands Chamber Choir, which sparked a lifelong interest in working with groups trained outside the Anglican choral tradition. These invitations also promoted in Phillips an interest in European culture, cuisines and languages. He has owned property in Paris since 1989 and given interviews in French, German, Italian and Spanish. He is also a student of Arabic (in which he has not given an interview). As of 2021, The Tallis Scholars have given more than two-thirds of their 2500 concerts outside the UK. Phillips started a collaboration with the BBC Singers in 2003, with whom he has now appeared in nearly 25 productions, most recently in May 2021 in a live broadcast from Maida Vale, featuring Mexican polyphony written for Puebla Cathedral. He also currently has projects in preparation with Intrada (Moscow), The Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir (Tallinn), El Leon de Oro (Oviedo), The Nederlands Chamber Choir and The Taipei Chamber Singers. == Educational work == In 2000 Peter Phillips and David Woodcock set up the first Tallis Scholars Summer School in Oakham. This was followed in 2005 by an extension in Seattle (US), and in 2007 by one in Sydney (Australia). He has also been involved with similar courses in Rimini, Evora and Barcelona. He lectured on the John Hall pre-University course in Venice from 1981 to 2019. Phillips began an association with Merton College Chapel in 1974 when, as an undergraduate, he directed Tallis\\'s \\'Why fum\\'th in fight\\' as a prelude to a performance of Vaughan Williams\\'s Fantasia on a Theme of Thomas Tallis. The Tallis Scholars recorded regularly in Merton Chapel between 1976 and 1987, returning more permanently in 2005. In 2006, with the help of Jessica Rawson and Simon Jones, Phillips established a new choral foundation at the College. This choir sang its first services under Phillips and Benjamin Nicholas in October 2008. In 2014 Phillips helped to establish the first of three London International Choral Competitions at St John\\'s Smith Square. Among the judges were John Rutter, Emma Kirkby, Alastair Hume, Mark Williams and James O\\'Donnell. Featured composers have been John Tavener, Gabriel Jackson and Arvo Pärt. Phillips has recently become a founding trustee of the Muze Trust, a charity designed to help with musical education in Zambia. At the invitation of Paul Kelly he visited Lusaka in 2010, directing Vox Zambesi in a concert and a recording, and continuing as a Trustee to the present. == Publications == Phillips wrote a regular column for the Spectator magazine on all aspects of classical music from January 1983 to April 2016, a span of exactly a third of a century. In 1989 he also wrote a cricket column. In 1995 he became the owner and publisher of the Musical Times – the oldest continuously published music journal in the world. He has also written for the Times Literary Supplement, the Times, the Guardian, the Musical Times, the Royal Academy Magazine, the BBC Music Magazine and the Evening Standard. He has written three books: English Sacred Music 1549–1649 (Gimell, 1991); What We Really Do (Musical Times, 2nd edition, 2013); and, during the pandemic of 2020/21, a novel entitled The Blue French, about a performance of Tallis’s Spem in alium (yet to be published). == Other activities == Phillips is a keen follower of cricket and a member of the Marylebone Cricket Club. He is also a member of the Chelsea Arts Club. In 1986 he became a qualified pilot, in the hope of taming his fear of turbulence. == Awards and honours == In 2005, Peter Phillips was made a Chevalier de l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Minister of Culture, a decoration intended to honour individuals who have contributed to the understanding of French culture in the world, in his case Josquin des Prez. From 2008 to 2016 he was made a Reed Rubin Director of Music at Merton College, Oxford, and in 2010 a Bodley Fellow. In 2021 he was elected an Honorary Fellow of St John’s College, Oxford, where he had been Organ Scholar from 1972 to 1975. With the Tallis Scholars he has received four Gramophone Awards (in 1987, 1991, 1994 and 2005); two Diapason d’Or de l’Année (in 1989 and 2012); three Grammy nominations (in 2002, 2009 and 2010); and Record of the Year from the BBC Music Magazine in 2021. His 1980 recording of Allegri\\'s Miserere was said by the BBC Music Magazine to be one of the 50 greatest recordings of all time.In 2009 the Tallis Scholars were voted by Early Music Today the fourth most influential early group in the history of the genre, after the instrumental ensembles of David Munrow, John Eliot Gardiner and Christopher Hogwood. In 2013 they were voted into the Gramophone\\'s Hall of Fame – about 120 names from the entire history of classical recording – the only early music group to be so listed. == References == English Sacred Music 1549–1649 (Gimell, 1991) What We Really Do (Musical Times: 1st edition 2003) What We Really Do (Musical Times: 2nd edition 2013) Gramophone Magazine (September 1994): Cover Feature Early Music Today (October/ November 2009 pg. 15)',\n",

              " 'Hotan (also known as Gosthana, Gaustana, Godana, Godaniya, Khotan, Hetian, Hotien) is a major oasis town in southwestern Xinjiang, an autonomous region in Western China. The city proper of Hotan broke off from the larger Hotan County to become an administrative area in its own right in August 1984. It is the seat of Hotan Prefecture. With a population of 408,900 (2018 census), Hotan is situated in the Tarim Basin some 1,500 kilometres (930 mi) southwest of the regional capital, Ürümqi. It lies just north of the Kunlun Mountains, which are crossed by the Sanju, Hindutash and Ilchi passes. The town, located southeast of Yarkant County and populated almost exclusively by Uyghurs, is a minor agricultural center. An important station on the southern branch of the historic Silk Road, Hotan has always depended on two strong rivers—the Karakash River and the White Jade River to provide the water needed to survive on the southwestern edge of the vast Taklamakan Desert. The White Jade River still provides water and irrigation for the town and oasis. == Etymology == The original name of Hotan is Godana, Gosthana/Gausthana/Gaustana or Godaniya, the name used in Sanskrit cosmological texts and also how the area is historically referred to as.Gosthana/Gausthana/Gaustana/Godana/Godaniya translates to \"land of cows\" in Sanskrit. In Chinese, the same name is written as Yu-t\\'ien, pronounced as Gu-dana. The pronunciation changed over the years to Kho-tan. In the 7th century, Xuanzang tried to reverse interpret it in Sanskrit as Kustana. However, the Tibetans continue to call it Gosthana, which also carries the meaning of \"land of cows\".An alternative etymology is proposed by Bailey, referring to the oldest indigenous form Hvatana, with hva- meaning \"own, owned\", whence \"Lord\" as in MP. \"khwa-day\". == History == The oasis of Hotan is strategically located at the junction of the southern (and most ancient) branch of the Silk Road joining China and the West with one of the main routes from ancient India and Tibet to Central Asia and distant China. It provided a convenient meeting place where not only goods, but technologies, philosophies, and religions were transmitted from one culture to another. Tocharians lived in this region over 2000 years ago. Several of the Tarim mummies were found in the region. At Sampul, east of the city of Hotan, there is an extensive series of cemeteries scattered over an area about 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) wide and 23 km (14 mi) long. The excavated sites range from about 300 BCE to 100 CE. The excavated graves have produced a number of fabrics of felt, wool, silk and cotton and even a fine bit of tapestry, the Sampul tapestry, showing the face of Caucasoid man which was made of threads of 24 shades of color. The tapestry had been cut up and fashioned into trousers worn by one of the deceased. An Anthropological study of 56 individuals showed a primarily Caucasoid population. A study in 2010 showed that an Eastern Eurasian lineage common in Siberia dominates the mitochondrial DNA of the mummies from the Xiaohe Cemetery. Their Y chromosome is distributed throughout Eastern Europe, South Asia, Central Asia, and Siberia.There is a relative abundance of information on Hotan readily available for study. The main historical sources are to be found in the Chinese histories (particularly detailed during the Han and early Tang dynasties) when China was interested in control of the Western Regions, the accounts of several Chinese pilgrim monks, a few Buddhist histories of Hotan that have survived in Classical Tibetan and a large number of documents in the Iranian Saka language and other languages discovered, for the most part, early this century at various sites in the Tarim Basin and from the hidden library at the Mogao Caves near Dunhuang. === Buddhist Khotan === The ancient Kingdom of Khotan was one of the earliest Buddhist states in the world and a cultural bridge across which Buddhist culture and learning were transmitted from India to China. Its capital was located to the west of the modern city of Hotan. The inhabitants of the Kingdom of Khotan, like those of early Kashgar and Yarkant, spoke Saka, one of the Eastern Iranian languages. Khotan\\'s indigenous dynasty (all of whose royal names are Indian in origin) governed a fervently Buddhist city-state boasting some 400 temples in the late 9th/early 10th century—four times the number recorded by Xuanzang around 630. The kingdom was independent but was intermittently under Chinese control during the Han and Tang Dynasty. After the Tang dynasty, Khotan formed an alliance with the rulers of Dunhuang. Khotan enjoyed close relations with the Buddhist centre at Dunhuang: the Khotanese royal family intermarried with Dunhuang élites, visited and patronized Dunhuang\\'s Buddhist temple complex, and donated money to have their portraits painted on the walls of the Mogao grottos. Through the 10th century, Khotanese royal portraits were painted in association with an increasing number of deities in the caves. Besides this, a particular site, Melikawat functioned as a major Buddhist center in the Kingdom of Khotan. In the 10th century, Khotan began a struggle with the Kara-Khanid Khanate, a Turkic state. The Kara-Khanid ruler, Sultan Satuq Bughra Khan, had converted to Islam: Satuq\\'s son, Musa, began to put pressure on Khotan in the mid-10th century, and sometime before 1006 Yusuf Qadir Khan of Kashgar besieged and took the city. This conquest of Buddhist Khotan by the Muslim Turks—about which there are many colourful legends—marked another watershed in the Islamicisation and Turkicisation of the Tarim Basin, and an end to local autonomy of this southern Tarim city state. Some Khotanese Buddhist works were unearthed.The rulers of Khotan were aware of the menace they faced since they arranged for the Mogao grottoes to paint a growing number of divine figures along with themselves. Halfway in the 10th century Khotan came under attack by the Qarakhanid ruler Musa, and in what proved to be a pivotal moment in the Turkification and Islamification of the Tarim Basin, the Karakhanid leader Yusuf Qadir Khan conquered Khotan around 1006. === Islamic Khotan === Yūsuf Qadr Khān was a brother or cousin of the Muslim ruler of Kashgar and Balasagun, Khotan lost its independence and between 1006 and 1165, became part of the Kara-Khanid Khanate. Later it fell to the Kara-Khitan Khanate, after which it was ruled by the Mongols. When Marco Polo visited Khotan in the 13th century, he noted that the people were all Muslim. He wrote that: Khotan was \"a province eight days’ journey in extent, which is subject to the Great Khan. The inhabitants all worship Mahomet. It has cities and towns in plenty, of which the most splendid, and the capital of the province, bears the same name as that of the province…It is amply stocked with the means of life. Cotton grows here in plenty. It has vineyards, estates and orchards in plenty. The people live by trade and industry; they are not at all warlike\". === 19th century === The town suffered severely during the Dungan Revolt (1862–77) against the Qing dynasty and again a few years later when Yaqub Beg of Kashgar made himself master of Kashgaria, ruling the newly founded Turkic state known at the time as Yettishar. === Post-Qing === Qing imperial authority collapsed in 1912. During the Republican era in China, warlords and local ethnic self-determination movements wrestled over control of Xinjiang. Abdullah Bughra, Nur Ahmad Jan Bughra, and Muhammad Amin Bughra declared themselves Emirs of Khotan during the Kumul Rebellion. Tunganistan was an independent administered region in the southern part of Xinjiang from 1934 to 1937. The territory included the oases of the southern Tarim Basin; the centre of the region was Khotan. Beginning with the Islamic rebellion in 1937, Hotan and the rest of the province came under the control of warlord Sheng Shicai. Sheng was later ousted by the Kuomintang. === People\\'s Republic of China === Shortly after the Communists won the civil war in 1949, Hotan was incorporated into the People\\'s Republic of China. In 1983/4, the urban area of Hotan was administratively split from the larger Hotan County, and from then on governed as a county-level city.On July 11, 2006, the townships of Jiya and Yurungqash (Yulongkashi) in Lop County and Tusalla (Tushala) in Hotan County were transferred to Hotan City.Following the July 2009 Ürümqi riots, ethnic tensions rose in Xinjiang and in Hotan in particular. As a result, the city has seen occasional bouts of violence. In June 2011, Hotan opened its first passenger-train service to Kashgar, which was established as a special economic zone following the riots. In July of the same year, a bomb and knife attack occurred on the city\\'s central thoroughfare. In June 2011, authorities in Hotan Prefecture sentenced Uyghur Muslim Hebibullah Ibrahim to ten years imprisonment for selling \"illegal religious materials\". In June 2012, Tianjin Airlines Flight 7554 was hijacked en route from Hotan to Ürümqi. In a report from the Uyghur American Association, in June 2012, notice was said to be given that police planned to undertake a search of every residence in Gujanbagh (Gujiangbage), Hotan. Hotan is the last municipality in Xinjiang with a majority Ugyhur presence in the core of the city. The UAA viewed this as an attempt to systematically intimidate the Uyghur population in Hotan.The Sultanim Cemetery (37°07′02″N 79°56′04″E) in central Hotan was a historical Uyghur graveyard that also included a religious shrine. According to a 2019 interview by the Uyghur Human Rights Project, the cemetery entombed four commanders of Sultan Satuq Bughra Khan, who conquered the city around 960 CE and spread Islam. Due to space limitations after over a thousand years of burials, multiple bodies had to reuse the same grave, and additionals layers were dug underneath old ones. Between 2018 and 2019, the cemetery was demolished and the western part of the land turned into a parking lot. == Geography and climate == Hotan has a temperate zone, cold desert climate (Köppen BWk), with a mean annual total of only 36.5 millimetres (1.44 in) of precipitation falling on 17.3 days of the year. Due to its southerly location in Xinjiang just north of the Kunlun Mountains, during winter it is one of the warmest locations in the region, with average high temperatures remaining above freezing throughout the year. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from −3.9 °C (25.0 °F) in January to 25.8 °C (78.4 °F) in July, and the annual mean is 13.03 °C (55.5 °F). The diurnal temperature variation is not large for a desert, averaging 11.8 °C (21.2 °F) annually. Although no month averages less than half of possible sunshine, the city only receives 2,587 hours of bright sunshine annually, which is on the low end for Xinjiang; monthly percent possible sunshine ranges from 50% in March to 75% in October. == Administrative divisions == The city includes four subdistricts, three towns, five townships and two other areas:Subdistricts: Nurbag Subdistrict (Nu\\'erbage; 努尔巴格街道/奴尔巴格街道), Gujanbagh Subdistrict (Gujiangbage; 古江巴格街道), Gulbagh Subdistrict (Gulebage; 古勒巴格街道), Na\\'erbage Subdistrict (纳尔巴格街道)Towns: Laskuy (Lasikui, Lasqi; لاسكۇي بازىرى / 拉斯奎镇), Yurungqash (Yulongkashi; يۇرۇڭقاش بازىرى / 玉龙喀什镇), Tusalla (Tushala; تۇساللا بازىرى, formerly تۇساللا يېزىسى / 吐沙拉镇, formerly 吐沙拉鄉)Townships: Shorbagh Township (Xiao\\'erbage; شورباغ يېزىسى / 肖尔巴格乡), Ilchi Township (Yiliqi; ئىلچى يېزىسى / 伊里其乡), Gujanbagh Township (Gujiangbage; گۇجانباغ يېزىسى / 古江巴格乡), Jiya Township (جىيا يېزىسى / 吉亚乡), Aqchal Township (Akeqiale ئاقچال يېزىسى / 阿克恰勒乡)Others: Beijing Industrial Park (北京工业园区), Hotan City Jinghe Logistics Park (和田市京和物流园区) == Demographics == Hotan is largely dominated by the Uyghurs, and as of 2015, 311,050 of the 348,289 residents of the county were Uyghur, 35,897 were Han Chinese and 1,342 were from other ethnic groups.In 1940, Owen Lattimore quoted the population of Khotan to be estimated as 26,000.In 1998 the urban population was recorded at 154,352, 83% of which were Uyghurs, and 17% were Han Chinese.In 1999, 83.01% of the population was Uyghur and 16.57% of the population was Han Chinese.In the 2000 census, the population was recorded as 186,123. In the 2010 census figure, the figure had risen to 322,300. The increase in population is partly due to boundary changes. == Transportation == === Air === Hotan Airport (IATA: HTN) serves the city. It serves regional flights to Ürümqi. Originally a military use airport, it was expanded significantly in 2002 to accommodate higher passenger volumes. It is located 12 km (7.5 mi) south of the city proper. === Road === Hotan is served by China National Highway 315, which runs along the southern Tarim Basin from Ruoqiang to Kashgar, and the Trans-Taklamakan Desert Highway, which run north to Luntai. An expressway is being built between Hotan and Karakax County (Moyu) as of 2014. === Rail === Hotan is connected to the rest of China\\'s rail network via the Kashgar–Hotan Railway, which opened to freight traffic in December 2010, and passenger service in June 2011. The railway station was constructed by a company under the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, and is located in the town of Lasqi (拉斯奎) northwest of the city proper. Passenger train service on this line is limited, with only one train per day, local service 5828/5825, linking the city with Kashgar (8~ hours) and Ürümqi (~34 hours). === Buses === Regular bus services link Hotan with Kashgar. There is also an express bus to Aksu via the 430 km (270 mi) \\'Hotan-Aksu Cross-Desert Highway\\' which was opened in 2007, travels alongside the intermittent Hotan River, and which takes about 5 or 6 hours. This same bus then goes on to Urumchi taking a total of about 21 hours from Hotan. == Economy == As of 1885, there was about 100,000 acres (662,334 mu) of cultivated land in Khotan. === Nephrite jade === Chinese historical sources indicate that Hotan was the main source of the nephrite jade used in ancient China. For several hundred years, until they were defeated by the Xiongnu in 176 BCE, the trade of Khotanese jade into China was controlled by the nomadic Yuezhi. The Chinese still refer to the Yurungkash as the White Jade River, alluding to the white jade recovered from its alluvial deposits. The light-colored jade is called \"Mutton fat\" jade. Most of the jade is now gone, with only a few kilos of good quality jade found yearly. Some is still mined in the Kunlun Mountains to the south in the summer, but it is generally of poorer quality than that found in the rivers. === Fabrics and carpets === Khotanese textiles were mentioned by Xuanzang, who visited the oasis in 644 CE. In his Biography it is stated: \"It produced carpets and fine felt, and the felt-makers also spun coarse and fine silk.\" Ancient Chinese-Khotanese relations were so close that the oasis emerged as one of the earliest centres of silk manufacture outside China. There are good reasons to believe that the silk-producing industry flourished in Hotan as early as the 5th century. According to one story, a Chinese princess given in marriage to a Khotan prince brought to the oasis the secret of silk-manufacture, \"hiding silkworms in her hair as part of her dowry\", probably in the first half of the 1st century CE. It was from Khotan that the eggs of silkworms were smuggled to Iran, reaching Justinian I\\'s Constantinople in 551.Silk production is still a major industry employing more than a thousand workers and producing some 150 million metres of silk annually. Silk weaving by Uyghur women is a thriving cottage industry, some of it produced using traditional methods. Hotan Silk Factory is one of the notable silk producers in Hotan. Atlas is the fabric used for traditional Uyghur clothing worn by Uyghur women. It is soft, light and graceful tie-dyed silk fabric. It comes various colors, the brighter and rich colors are for small children to young ladies. The gray and dark colors are for elderly women. The oldest piece of kilim which we have any knowledge was obtained by the archaeological explorer Aurel Stein; a fragment from an ancient settlement near Hotan, which was buried by sand drifts about the fourth century CE. The weave is almost identical with that of modern kilims. Hotanese pile carpets are still highly prized and form an important export. == Notable persons == Islam Akhun Muhammad Amin Bughra Nur Ahmadjan Bughra Abdullah Bughra == Gallery == == See also == Atlas silk Dandan Oilik Hotan Cultural Museum Khatana Kingdom of Khotan Silk Road transmission of Buddhism == Notes == == References == === Citations === === Sources === == External links == Official government site (in Chinese) Silk Road Seattle - University of Washington (The Silk Road Seattle website contains many useful resources including a number of full-text historical works) Site devoted to the Buddhism of Khotan with a copy of Sir Aurel Stein\\'s map of the Tarim Basin and Khotan region Satellite image of region which can be enlarged China: Taklamakan - Desert With No Ocean Underground Bealby, John Thomas (1911). \"Khotan\" .

              " 'Audovera (d. 580) was the first wife or mistress of Chilperic I, king of Neustria. They had five children. Theudebert, killed in battle in 575 by Guntram Boso during the interminable conflict between Chilperic and his brothers. Merovech, married the widow Brunhilda, becoming his father\\'s enemy. Killed by his servants on his own orders in 578. Clovis, assassinated by Fredegund in 580.

Basina, nun, banished to a convent in 580. She later led a revolt in the abbey of Poitiers in 589.Some time before 567, Audovera and Fredegund prepared for the baptism of Childesinda while Chilperic was away. Fredegund learnt that it was forbidden for a mother to receive her own child in her arms following a baptism, due to a canon law forbidding marriage between parents and godparents. Fredegund arranged the events of the baptism such that Audovera unknowingly broke this taboo. On Chilperic\\'s return, Fredegund informed him of what Audovera had done. Chilperic committed Audovera to a convent in a rage. Fredegund later had her murdered in 580 to coincide with the assassination of Clovis and the exile of Basina. == References == \" A Popular History of France Vol 1, chapter VIII, the Merovingians\" from Humanitiesweb, last accessed July 22, 2007',\n",
              " 'This article outlines the present structure of the European Union\\'s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), a part of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) based on articles 42–46 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). Article 42.2 of TEU states that the CSDP includes the \\'progressive framing\\' of a common Union defence policy, and will lead to a common defence, when the European Council of national heads of state or government, acting unanimously, so decides. The CSDP involves military or civilian missions being deployed to preserve peace, prevent conflict and strengthen international security in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter. Military missions are carried out by EU forces established with contributions from the member states\\' armed forces. The CSDP also entails collective self-defence amongst member states as well as a Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) in which 25 of the 28 national armed forces pursue structural integration. The CSDP structure, headed by the Union\\'s High Representative (HR/VP), Josep Borrell Fontelles, comprises: the Defence Industry Directorate-General of the European Commission relevant sections of the External Action Service (EEAS) — including the Military Staff (EUMS) with its so-called Military Planning and Conduct Capability (MPCC) a number of Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) preparatory bodies — such as the Military Committee (EUMC) four agencies, including the Defence Agency (EDA)The EU does not have a permanent military command structure along the lines of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\\'s (NATO) Allied Command Operations (ACO), although it has been agreed that ACO resources may be used for the conduct of the EU\\'s CSDP missions. The MPCC, established in 2017 and to be strengthened in 2020, does however represent the EU\\'s first step in developing a permanent military headquarters. In parallel, the newly established European Defence Fund (EDF) marks the first time the EU budget is used to finance multinational defence projects. The CSDP structure is sometimes referred to as the European Defence Union (EDU), especially in relation to its prospective development as the EU\\'s defence arm.Decisions relating to the CSDP are proposed by the HR/VP, adopted by the FAC, generally requiring unanimity, and then implemented by the HR/VP. == Deployment procedure == Military operations may be launched after four planning phases, through which the Operation Commander (Op. Cdr.), Military Staff (EUMS), Military Committee (EUMC), Political and Security Committee (PSC) and Council have different roles: I: Political Framework for Crisis Approach (PFCA) II: Crisis Management Concept (CMC) III: Military Strategic Options (MSO, unless within CMC) and Initiating Military Directive (IMD) IV: Concept of Operations (CONOPS), Operations Plan (OPLAN) and Rules of Engagement (ROE) == Overview == All military or civilian missions of the European Union (EU), as part of its Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), are planned and conducted by an operation headquarters (OHQ). All civilian missions are directed by the Civilian Planning and Conduct Capability (CPCC), a directorate of the External Action Service (EEAS) in Brussels, Belgium. For each military mission an OHQ is chosen. The EU does not have a permanent military command structure along the lines of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\\'s (NATO) Allied Command Operations (ACO), although it has been agreed that ACO resources may be used for the conduct of the EU\\'s CSDP missions. The Military Planning and Conduct Capability (MPCC), established in 2017 and to be strengthened in 2020, does however represent the EU\\'s first step in developing a permanent operational headquarters (OHQ). The EU command and control (C2) structure is directed by political bodies composed of member states\\' representatives, and generally requires unanimous decisions. As of April 2019: Liaison: Advice and recommendations Support and monitoring Preparatory work 1 In the event of a CSDP Civilian Mission also being in the field, the relations with the Civilian Planning and Conduct Capability (CPCC) and its Civilian Operation Commander (Civ OpCdr), as well as the subordinate Head of Mission (HoM), are coordinated as shown.2 Other Component Commanders (CCs) and service branches which may be established.3 The MPCC is part of the EUMS and Dir MPCC is double-hatted as DGEUMS. Unless the MPCC is used as Operation Headquarters (OHQ), either a national OHQ offered by member states or the NATO Command Structure (NCS) would serve this purpose. In the latter instance, Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe (DSACEUR), rather than Dir MPCC, would serve as Operation Commander (OpCdr).4 Unless the MPCC is used as Operation Headquarters (OHQ), the MFCdr would be known as a Force Commander (FCdr), and direct a Force Headquarters (FHQ) rather than a MFHQ. Whereas the MFHQ would act both on the operational and tactical level, the FHQ would act purely on the operational level.5 The political strategic level is not part of the C2 structure per se, but represents the political bodies, with associated support facilities, that determine the missions\\' general direction. The Council determines the role of the High Representative (HR/VP), who serves as Vice-President of the European Commission, attends European Council meetings, chairs the Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) and may chair the Political and Security Committee (PSC) in times of crisis. The HR/VP proposes and implements CSDP decisions.6 Same composition as Committee of Permanent Representatives (COREPER) II, which also prepares for the CSDP-related work of the FAC. == Bodies and political leadership == === High Representative === The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, commonly referred to as the High Representative (HR/VP), is the chief co-ordinator and representative of the EU\\'s Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), including the CSDP. The position is currently held by Josep Borrell. Where foreign matters is agreed between EU member states, the High Representative can speak for the EU in that area, such as negotiating on behalf of the member states. Beside representing the EU at international fora and co-ordinating the CFSP and the CSDP, the HR/VP is: ex-officio Vice-President of the European Commission participant in the meetings of the European Council responsible of the European Union Special Representatives head of the External Action Service and the delegations President of the Foreign Affairs Council Head of the European Defence Agency Chairperson of the board of the European Union Institute for Security Studies === European Commission === Directorate-General for Defence Industry and Space, established in 2019 === External Action Service === The European External Action Service (EEAS) is the diplomatic service and foreign and defence ministry of the EU. The EEAS is led by the HR/VP and seated in Brussels. The EEAS does not propose or implement policy in its own name, but prepares acts to be adopted by the HR/VP, the European Commission or the Council. The EEAS is also in charge of EU diplomatic missions (delegations) and intelligence and crisis management structures.The following EEAS bodies take part in managing the CSDP: The Military Staff (EUMS) is an EEAS Directorate-General that provides strategic advice to the HR/VP and commands military operations through its Military Planning and Conduct Capability (MPCC) operational headquarters. The EUMS also reports to the European Union Military Committee (EUMC), representing member states\\' Chiefs of Defence, and performs \"early warning\", situation assessment and strategic planning. The EUMS currently consists of 200+ military and civilian personnel. The EUMS and the European Defence Agency (EDA) together form the Secretariat of the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO), the structural integration pursued by 25 of the 28 national armed forces of the EU since 2017. The Intelligence and Situation Centre (EU INTCEN) The Security and Defence College (ESDC) is a virtual institution for strategic level training. The ESDC consists of a network of various national institutions, such as defence colleges, and the European Union Institute for Security Studies. The ESDC initiated the European initiative for the exchange of young officers inspired by Erasmus, often referred to as military Erasmus, exchanging between armed forces of future military officers as well as their teachers and instructors during their initial education and training. Due to the fact that the initiative is implemented by the Member States on a purely voluntary basis, their autonomy with regard to military training is not compromised. The Crisis Management and Planning Directorate (CMPD) The Civilian Planning and Conduct Capability (CPCC) The Joint Support Coordination Cell (JSCC)The relationship between the High Representative, the Military Staff and Military Committee as of November 2017: Colour key: High Representative (a Vice-President of the Commission) Military Committee (EUMC; a Council body) Military Staff (EUMS; a Directorate-General of the External Action Service) === Council === The Council of the European Union has the following, Brussels-based preparatory bodies in the field of CSDP: The Political and Security Committee (PSC) consists of ambassadorial level representatives from the EU member states and usually meets twice per week. The PSC is chaired by the External Action Service. Ambassador Walter Stevens has been the PSC permanent chair since June 2013 The main functions of the PSC are keeping track of the international situation, and helping to define EU policies within the CFSP and CSDP. PSC sends guidance to, and receives advice from the European Union Military Committee (EUMC), the Committee for Civilian Aspects of Crisis Management (CIVCOM) as well as the European Union Institute for Security Studies. It is also a forum for dialogue on CSDP matters between the EU Member States. PSC also drafts opinions for the Foreign Affairs Council, which is one of the configurations of the Council of the European Union. CFSP matters are passed to the Foreign Affairs Council via COREPER II. The European Union Military Committee (EUMC) is composed of member states\\' Chiefs of Defence (CHOD). These national CHODs are regularly represented in the EUMC in Brussels by their permanent Military Representatives (MilRep), who often are two- or three-star flag officers. The EUMC is under the under authority of the EU\\'s High Representative (HR) and the Political and Security Committee (PSC). The EUMC gives military advice to the EU\\'s High Representative (HR) and Political and Security Committee (PSC). The EUMC also oversees the European Union Military Staff (EUMS). The Committee for Civilian Aspects of Crisis Management (CIVCOM) is an advisory body dealing with civilian aspects of crisis management. The activities of CIVCOM therefore forms part of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) of EU, and the civilian side of the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). CIVCOM is composed of representatives of the EU member states. The activities of CIVCOM for civilian CSDP tasks occur in parallel to the European Union Military Committee (EUMC) for military CDP tasks. Both EUMC and CIVCOM receive directions from, and report to the Political and Security Committee (PSC). The decision to establish CIVCOM was taken in 2000 by the Council of the European Union. The Politico-Military Group (PMG) carries out preparatory work for the Political and Security Committee (PSC). It covers the political aspects of EU military and civil-military issues, including concepts, capabilities and operations and missions. The tasks of the PMG include: 1) preparing Council conclusions and provides recommendations for the PSC, and monitoring their effective implementation 2) contributing to the development of horizontal policy and facilitating information exchanges. The PMG has a particular responsibility regarding partnerships with non-EU countries and other organisations, including EU-NATO relations, as well as exercises. The PMG is chaired by a representative of the HR/VP. === Agencies === The following agencies relate to the CSDP: The Defence Agency (EDA), based in Brussels, facilitates the improvement of national military capabilities and integration. In that capacity, it makes proposals, coordinates, stimulates collaboration, and runs projects. The Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex), based in Warsaw, Poland, leads the European coast guard that controls the borders of the Schengen Area. The Institute for Security Studies (ISS), based in Paris, is an autonomous think tank that researches EU-relevant security issues. The research results are published in papers, books, reports, policy briefs, analyses and newsletters. In addition, the institute convenes seminars and conferences on relevant issues that bring together EU officials, national experts, decision-makers and NGO representatives from all Member States. The Satellite Centre (SatCen), located in Torrejón de Ardoz, Spain, supports the decision-making by providing products and services resulting from the exploitation of relevant space assets and collateral data, including satellite and aerial imagery, and related services. == Permanent structured cooperation == The Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) is the framework in which 25 of the 28 national armed forces pursue structural integration. Based on Article 42.6 and Protocol 10 of the Treaty on European Union, introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009, PESCO was first initiated in 2017. The initial integration within the PESCO format is a number of projects planned to launch in 2018.PESCO is similar to enhanced co-operation in other policy areas, in the sense that integration does not require that all EU member states participate. == Funding of missions == == Defence industry coordination and research funding == The European Defence Fund is an EU-managed fund for coordinating and increasing national investment in defence research and improve interoperability between national forces. It was proposed in 2016 by President Jean-Claude Juncker and established in 2017 to a value of €5.5 billion per year. The fund has two stands; research (€90 million until the end of 2019 and €500 million per year after 2020) and development & acquisition (€500 million in total for 2019–20 then €1 billion per year after 2020).Together with the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence and Permanent Structured Cooperation it forms a new comprehensive defence package for the EU.EU-developed infrastructure for military use includes: European Secure Software-defined Radio Galileo (satellite navigation) == See also == Structure of NATO == Notes == == References == == Further reading == European Defence (2019), European Court of Auditors',\n",
              " 'Franz P. Freudenthal is a Bolivian physician who is known for several medical inventions, including a device that can cure heart ailments in children. == Career == Franz P. Freudenthal was born in La Paz, Bolivia to German immigrant parents. He was inspired to enter medicine by his grandmother, Dr. Ruth Tichauer of Wreszinski, who was born in Königsberg in 1910 daughter Walter Wreszinski and died in La Paz in 1995. He used to go with her as a child on her medical visits in remote rural areas of Bolivia. She was a pioneer in family planning and in outpatient treatment of tuberculosis, and shared her philosophy of life with Freudenthal. He attended the Higher University of San Andrés in La Paz for his undergraduate studies, then did his internship at Children\\'s Hospital of La Paz. He decided to specialize in pediatric cardiology. His wife, Alexandra Heath, is also a doctor. The couple received scholarships to take specialized training in Germany. He performed his first operation on a child in Germany in the 1990s.Freudenthal became interested in medical devices. He was part of a team that in March 1998 reported encouraging results of tests on neonatal lambs for occlusion of patent ductus arteriosus with a double-helix device at RWTH Aachen University, Germany. The devices used memory-shaped double-cone stainless steel coils mounted on a titanium/nickel core wire. Freudenthal said that by the age of 25 he had treated more than 20 sheep with devices, and at the age of 29 had treated his first patient, a child that could not be cured in any other way.After returning to Bolivia in 2003 the Freudenthals founded Kardiozentrum, a center for diagnosis and treatment of congenital heart disease. They also created PFM Bolivia, to develop and market medical devices. In 2014 Freudenthal was heading a team of 80 young innovators on a new project to develop a treatment for strokes. Freudenthal has taken out a number of patents including a left atrial appendage occlusion device, embolization device, tissue clip, tissue tack, snare mechanism for surgical retrieval and deployment device for cardiac surgery. == Nit Occlud device == Freudenthal is known for his Nit Occlud device for treatment of an infant heart problem. The prototypes were first tested on sheep, and since then have been used successfully by Freudenthal on hundreds of children, and have been exported around the world. The device treats a congenital disorder in the heart known as a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). This occurs when the ductus arteriosus blood vessel, which bypasses the lungs before a baby is born, fails to close up soon after birth. The affected infant suffers from labored breathing, failure to gain weight and other problems. The condition is much more common in Bolivia, where the country around La Paz is at an elevation of 4,000 metres (13,000 ft), than in other places.The device is made from a single wire of nitinol, a flexible alloy of nickel and titanium. Nitinol was originally developed by the US military. The tiny Nit Occlud devices are small and intricate, and difficult to mass-produce. Instead they are woven by Aymara women in a \"clean room\". It takes about two hours to make each device. The device can be placed without an invasive operation, using cardiac catheterization. Nitinol is able to memorize its shape. The device is folded up and inserted into a catheter which is inserted into the groin and then run through blood vessels to the position in the heart where it is to be placed. The device is released and returns to its original shape, blocking the hole that caused the heart problem. By using a minimally invasive approach the technique addresses the concerns of some indigenous people of Bolivia that to manipulate the heart is to desecrate the soul. It takes about 30 minutes to place the device.Technically, the Nit-Occlud ASD-R, is a double-umbrella, self-expanding, self-centering and premounted device knitted from a single nitinol wire without any soldering or protruding clamps or screws. The Nit-Occlud is similar to other self-expandable devices, which have provided excellent long-term clinical outcomes. The device has a unique shape that offers various advantages and a special snare-like release mechanism. It ranges in size from 8 to 30 millimetres (0.31 to 1.18 in) in stent diameter. The first human implantation was done at the La Paz Kardiocentrum by Alexandra Heath and coworkers. 53 implantations were made by this group from May 2007 to February 2011. Four attempts failed. Of the 53 implantations, complete closure occurred immediately in 71% of patients, and 100% after six months. Findings are generally very positive, although the erosion rate is not yet known.In August 2014 it was announced that Freudenthal had won the \"Innovators of America\" award in the Science and Technology category for his occlusion device to cure congenital heart disease in children. The award is given by Innovative America, is sponsored by the CAF – Development Bank of Latin America and the Spanish CAF Ezentis group, and was to be presented in Medellín, Colombia on 21 August 2014. As of 2014 the device had cured at least 50,000 children worldwide, and about 500 in Bolivia. == References == == External links == A new way to heal hearts without surgery - TED Talk by Franz Freudenthal == Sources ==',\n",
              " 'Carl Emil Krarup (12 October 1872 – 29/30 December 1909) was a Danish telegraph engineer who is chiefly known for the invention of a kind of loaded cable, eponymously called Krarup cable, which made improvements in the transmission of telephone signals, especially on submarine cables. == Career == Krarup was originally a civil engineer. He was in charge of public works in Copenhagen until 1898 when he joined the Danish Telegraph Administration. In 1901 he conducted research on loaded lines at the University of Würzburg in Germany. Returning to Denmark he continued the theoretical work at the University of Copenhagen and published a paper in 1902. == Krarup cable == Krarup cable is a method of loading lines to reduce their distortion. All practical methods of loading add series inductance to the cable to try to meet the Heaviside condition for no signal distortion. Krarup cable consists of iron wires wound tightly around the copper conducting cores and it is the iron that is the source of the additional inductance. However, it still does not have sufficient inductance to fully meet the Heaviside condition. Its construction also makes it expensive compared to the previously existing method of adding discrete loading coils at intervals along the cable. Against this, Krarup cable is lighter and easier to lay. The weight of early submarine cables using loading coils could cause excessive stress in the cable if not handled carefully. Additionally, Krarup cable has none of the problems of sealing the joins against seawater which was a major problem with loading coils before modern polymers began to be used. For these reasons, Krarup cable was popular on shorter distances, where the distortion was not so high that loading coils had to be used, until the advent of permalloy cable superseded it. The first cable to be laid with Krarup cable, indeed the first cable to be laid with any kind of continuous loading, was between Helsingør (Denmark) and Helsingborg (Sweden) in 1902. This cable was engineered by Krarup himself. == Notes == == References == Huurdeman, AA, The worldwide history of telecommunications, pp. 321–322, Wiley-IEEE, 2003.',\n",

              " 'Mercury(I) sulfate, commonly called mercurous sulphate (UK) or mercurous sulfate (US) is the chemical compound Hg2SO4. Mercury(I) sulfate is a metallic compound that is a white, pale yellow or beige powder. It is a metallic salt of sulfuric acid formed by replacing both hydrogen atoms with mercury(I). It is highly toxic; it could be fatal if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed by skin. == Structure == In the crystal, mercurous sulfate is made up of Hg22+ center with an Hg-Hg distance of about 2.50 Å. The SO42− anions form both long and short Hg-O bonds ranging from 2.23 to 2.93 Å.Focusing on the shorter Hg-O bonds, the Hg – Hg – O bond angle is 165°±1°. == Preparation == One way to prepare mercury(I) sulfate is to mix the acidic solution of mercury(I) nitrate with 1 to 6 sulfuric acid solution:, Hg2(NO3)2 + H2SO4 → Hg2SO4 + 2 HNO3It can also be prepared by reacting an excess of mercury with concentrated sulfuric acid: 2 Hg + 2 H2SO4 → Hg2SO4 + 2 H2O + SO2 == Use in electrochemical cells == Mercury(I) sulfate is often used in electrochemical cells. It was first introduced in electrochemical cells by Latimer Clark in 1872, It was then alternatively used in Weston cells made by George Augustus Hulett in 1911. It has been found to be a good electrode at high temperatures above 100 °C along with silver sulfate.Mercury(I) sulfate has been found to decompose at high temperatures. The decomposition process is endothermic, and it occurs between 335 °C and 500 °C. Mercury(I) sulfate has unique properties that make the standard cells possible. It has a rather low solubility (about one gram per liter); diffusion from the cathode system is not excessive; and it is sufficient to give a large potential at a mercury electrode. == References ==',\n",
              " 'This article describes the Paschal candle of the Western Churches. For the Paschal triple-candle used in Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic churches see Paschal trikirion. A Paschal candle is a large, white candle used in liturgies in Western Christianity (viz., the Roman Catholic Church, the Lutheran Churches, the Anglican Communion, and the Methodist Churches, among others). A new Paschal candle is blessed and lit every year at Easter, and is used throughout the Paschal season which is during Easter and then throughout the year on special occasions, such as baptisms and funerals. The equivalent of the Paschal candle in the Western Orthodox Church is the Paschal trikirion, which differs in both style and usage. == Etymology == The term Paschal comes from the Latin word Pascha, which came from the Hebrew word Pesach, which in Hebrew means \\'Passover\\', and relates to the Paschal mystery of salvation. It is sometimes referred to as the \"Easter candle\" or the \"Christ candle.\" == Description == For congregations that use a Paschal candle, it is the largest candle in the worship space. In most cases today the candle will display several common symbols: The cross, which is the most prominent symbol and most clearly identifies it as the Paschal candle The Greek letters alpha and omega, which symbolize that God is the beginning and the end (from the Book of Revelation) The year when the particular candle is being used, which represents God amidst the present congregation Five grains of incense (most often red), which are embedded in the candle (sometimes encased in wax \"nails\") during the Easter Vigil to represent the five wounds of Jesus: the three nails that pierced his hands and feet, the spear thrust into his side, and the thorns that crowned his head.In the [medieval] Church, Paschal candles often reached a stupendous size. The Paschal candle of Salisbury Cathedral was said to have been 36 feet (11 metres) tall. Today, in the United States and Southern Europe (e.g., Italy and France) the candle is approximately 4 inches (10 centimetres) in diameter and 36 to 48 inches (91 to 122 centimetres) tall; in Northern Europe the candle tends to be shorter in height (19 to 24 inches/48 to 61 centimetres) and wider in diameter (3 to 5 inches/7.6 to 12.7 centimetres). == Usage == === Easter Vigil === For churches that celebrate the Easter Vigil on the night of Holy Saturday, the ceremonial lighting of the Paschal candle is one of the most solemn moments of the service. The Easter Vigil liturgies of the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, Anglican, Methodist and Presbyterian Churches are nearly identical.On Maundy Thursday of the same week the entire church is darkened by extinguishing all candles and lamps. This represents the darkness of a world without God. At the opening of the Easter Vigil a \"new fire\" is lit and blessed. The minister will trace the symbols (mentioned above) on the Paschal candle, saying words similar to: \"Christ, yesterday and today, the beginning and the end, the Alpha and Omega. To Him belongs all time and all the ages; all glory and dominion is his now and forever. Amen.\" They then insert five grains of incense (reminiscent of the nails used to fasten Christ on the Cross) on the five points of the cross, saying: \"By His holy and glorious wounds may Christ our Lord guard and keep us.\" The Paschal candle is the first candle to be lit with a flame from this sacred fire, representing the light of Christ coming into the world. This represents the risen Christ, as a symbol of light (life) dispelling darkness (death). As it is lit, the minister may say words similar to: \"The light of Christ, rising in Glory, dispel the darkness of our hearts and minds.\" Typically, the worshiping assembly then processes into the church led by the Paschal candle. The candle is raised three times during the procession, accompanied by the chant \"The light of Christ\" to which the assembly responds \"Thanks be to God\". In some communities, it is common for nearby churches of different Christian denominations (e.g. Catholic, Lutheran, Anglican, Methodist and Presbyterian) to make the new Easter Fire together and then after this, each congregation processes back to their own church with their own Paschal Candle for their Easter Vigil celebration; this is considered to be a fostering of ecumenism. Following the procession the Exultet is chanted, traditionally by a deacon, but it may be chanted by the priest or a cantor. The Exultet concludes with a blessing of the candle: Accept this Easter candle, a flame divided but undimmed, a pillar of fire that glows to the honor of God. (For it is fed by the holy melting wax, which the mother bee brought forth to make this precious candle.) Let it mingle with the lights of heaven and continue bravely burning to dispel the darkness of this night! May the Morning Star which never sets find this flame still burning: Christ, that Morning Star, who came back from the dead, and shed his peaceful light on all humanity, your Son, who lives and reigns for ever and ever. Amen. From the New Roman Missal: On this, your night of grace, O holy Father, accept this candle, a solemn offering, the work of bees and of your servants’ hands, an evening sacrifice of praise, this gift from your most holy Church. But now we know the praises of this pillar, which glowing fire ignites for God’s honor, a fire into many flames divided, yet never dimmed by sharing of its light, for it is fed by melting wax, drawn out by mother bees to build a torch so precious. O truly blessed night, when things of heaven are wed to those of earth, and divine to the human. Therefore, O Lord, we pray you that this candle, hallowed to the honor of your name, may persevere undimmed, to overcome the darkness of this night. Receive it as a pleasing fragrance, and let it mingle with the lights of heaven. May this flame be found still burning by the Morning Star: the one Morning Star who never sets, Christ your Son, who, coming back from death’s domain, has shed his peaceful light on humanity, and lives and reigns for ever and ever. R. Amen. In some traditions, the base of the candle may be ritually immersed in the baptismal font before proceeding with the remainder of the service. This candle is traditionally the one from which all other lights are taken for the Easter service. === Other times of the year === The candle remains lit at all worship services throughout Easter season which ends on Pentecost Sunday, (or in some traditions until Ascension Day, when it is extinguished just after the Gospel), during which time it is located in the sanctuary close to the altar. After the Easter season, it is frequently placed near the baptismal font. Before 1955, the option existed of blessing the baptismal font on the Vigil of Pentecost, and this was the only time the Paschal candle would be lit at services after Ascension. The Paschal candle is also lit during baptisms to signify the Holy Spirit and fire that John the Baptist promised to those who were baptised in Christ. During the baptismal rite in many traditions, a small lit candle will be given to the newly baptised by a member of the community, with words similar to, \"Let your light so shine before others, that they might see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.\" (Matthew 5:16) In the Novus Ordo, the Paschal candle is also lit and placed near the casket or urn during the funeral services such as the Mass of Repose and the Mass of Requiem. It is important to note that once lit the candle should remain burning until finished. This is to signify the hope of the resurrection into which Christians are baptised. == Eastern usage == In the Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic churches, there is no direct correspondence to the Western Paschal candle. However, throughout Bright Week, the priest carries a cross and paschal trikirion at all of the services, especially when censing, during the Little Entrance or when giving the Paschal greeting. The trikirion consists of three lit candles in a candlestick, which the priest carries in his left hand. In the Slavic tradition, the three candles may be white or different colors: green, red, blue. The deacon also carries a special Paschal candle which is a single large candle whenever he leads an ektenia (litany) or censes. == References == == External links == The Candle Carving Site Herbermann, Charles, ed.

              " 'Macaroni and cheese (also called mac and cheese in Canada and the United States and macaroni cheese in the United Kingdom) is a dish of cooked macaroni pasta and a cheese sauce, most commonly Cheddar sauce.The traditional macaroni and cheese is a casserole baked in the oven; however, it may be prepared in a sauce pan on top of the stove or using a packaged mix. The cheese is often first incorporated into a Béchamel sauce to create a Mornay sauce, which is then added to the pasta. In the United States, it is considered a comfort food. == History == Cheese and pasta casseroles were recorded in the 14th century in the Italian cookbook, Liber de Coquina, which featured a dish of Parmesan cheese and pasta. A cheese and pasta casserole known as makerouns was recorded in the 14th-century medieval English cookbook, the Forme of Cury. It was made with fresh, hand-cut pasta which was sandwiched between a mixture of melted butter and cheese. The recipe given (in Middle English) was: Take and make a thynne foyle of dowh. and kerve it on pieces, and cast hem on boiling water & seeþ it well. take cheese and grate it and butter cast bynethen and above as losyns. and serue forth. This is the above recipe in modern English: Make a thin sheet of dough and cut it in pieces. Place them in boiling water and boil them well. Take cheese and grate it and add it and place butter beneath and above as with losyns [a dish similar to lasagne], and serve. The first modern recipe for macaroni and cheese was included in Elizabeth Raffald\\'s 1769 book, The Experienced English Housekeeper. Raffald\\'s recipe is for a Béchamel sauce with cheddar cheese—a Mornay sauce in French cooking—which is mixed with macaroni, sprinkled with Parmesan, and baked until bubbly and golden.To dress Macaroni with Permasent [Parmasan] Cheese. Boil four Ounces of Macaroni ’till it be quite tender, and lay it on a Sieve to drain, then put it in a Tolling Pan, with about a Gill of good Cream, a Lump of Butter rolled in Flour, boil it five Minutes, pour it on a Plate, lay all over it Permasent Cheese toasted; send it to the Table on a Water Plate, for it soon goes cold.Another recipe from 1784 stated that the small tubes of macaroni must be boiled, then drained in a sifter before being moved to a frying pan. Heavy cream is then added to the macaroni along with a \"knob of butter\" rolled in flour, and it must be cooked for five minutes before being transferred to a dish and topped with toasted Parmesan and pepper. The famous British Victorian cookbook Mrs. Beeton\\'s Book of Household Management included two instances of \"Macaroni, as usually served with the Cheese Course\". One of them states: The macaroni, (which should be \"tender but perfectly firm, no part being allowed to melt, and the form entirely preserved\" – lest one be tempted to cook it for so long it actually disintegrated) is then topped with more cheese, pepper, and breadcrumbs, before receiving a final dose of melted butter for good measure and being placed before a \"bright fire\" to brown the crumbs, or grilled with a salamander broiler. In the United Kingdom, during the 2010s, it has seen a surge in popularity, becoming widespread as a meal and as a side order in both fast food and upmarket restaurants. === United States === The US president Thomas Jefferson and James Hemings, his slave, encountered macaroni in Paris and brought the recipe back to Monticello. Jefferson drew a sketch of the pasta and wrote detailed notes on the extrusion process. In 1793, he commissioned the US ambassador to France William Short to purchase a machine for making it. Evidently, the machine was not suitable, as Jefferson later imported both macaroni and Parmesan cheese for his use at Monticello. In 1802, Jefferson served \"a pie called macaroni\" at a state dinner. The menu of the dinner was reported by Reverend Manasseh Cutler, who apparently was not fond of the cheesy macaroni casserole. Nevertheless, since that time, baked macaroni and cheese has remained popular in the United States. A recipe called \"macaroni and cheese\" appeared in the 1824 cookbook The Virginia House-Wife written by Mary Randolph. Randolph\\'s recipe had three ingredients: macaroni, cheese, and butter, layered together and baked in a hot oven. The cookbook was the most influential cookbook of the 19th century, according to culinary historian Karen Hess. Similar recipes for macaroni and cheese occur in the 1852 Hand-book of Useful Arts, and the 1861 Godey\\'s Lady\\'s Book. By the mid-1880s, cookbooks as far west as Kansas and Festus, Missouri, included recipes for macaroni and cheese casseroles. Factory production of the main ingredients made the dish affordable, and recipes made it accessible, but not notably popular. As it became accessible to a broader section of society, macaroni and cheese lost its upper-class appeal. === Canada === Macaroni and cheese was brought to Canada by British immigrants, coming from other parts of the British Empire. Macaroni and cheese recipes have been attested in Canada since at least Modern Practical Cookery in 1845, which suggests a puff pastry lining (suggesting upper-class refinement); a sauce of cream, egg yolks, mace, and mustard; and grated Parmesan or Cheshire cheese on top. Canadian Cheddar cheese was also becoming popularized at this time and was likely also used during that era.Macaroni and cheese is very popular in contemporary Canada. Kraft Dinner is the most popular brand of packaged macaroni and cheese. Sasha Chapman, writing in The Walrus, considered it to be Canada\\'s national dish, ahead of poutine. In fact, Canadians purchase nearly 25% of the seven million boxes of Kraft Dinner sold worldwide each week. == Variations == Pasta other than macaroni are often used: almost any short-cut extruded pasta and many of the decorative cut pasta will do, particularly those with folds and pockets to hold the cheese. The dish may still be referred to as \"macaroni and cheese,\" \"mac n\\' cheese,\" or \"cheesy mac\" when made with a different pasta; while \"shells and cheese\" are sometimes used when it is made with conchiglie. While Cheddar cheese is most commonly used for macaroni and cheese, other cheeses may also be used — usually sharp in flavor — and two or more cheeses can be combined. Other cheeses can be used such as Gruyere, Gouda, Havarti, and Jarlsberg cheese.Macaroni and cheese can be made by simply layering slices of cheese and pasta (often with butter or evaporated milk) then baking in a casserole, rather than preparing as a cheese sauce. Also, some like to include a crunchy topping to their baked macaroni and cheese by topping it off with bread crumbs or crushed crackers, which also keeps the noodles on top from drying out when baking. One novelty presentation is deep-fried macaroni and cheese found at fairs and food carts. === Regional variations and analogues === In Scotland, macaroni and cheese can often be found in pies, known endearingly as a macaroni pie. A similar traditional dish in Switzerland, dating from the 19th century, is called Älplermagronen (Alpine herder\\'s macaroni), which is also available in boxed versions. Älplermagronen are made of macaroni, cream, cheese, roasted onions, and in some recipes, potatoes. In the Canton of Uri, the potatoes are traditionally omitted, and in some regions, bacon or ham is added. The cheese is often Emmental cheese or Appenzeller cheese. It is usually accompanied by apple sauce. == Prepared and packaged mixes == Packaged macaroni and cheese are available in frozen form or as boxed ingredients for simplified preparation. Boston Market, Michelina\\'s, Kraft Foods, Cracker Barrel, and Stouffer\\'s are some of the more recognizable brands of prepared and frozen macaroni and cheese available in the United States. \"Macaroni and cheese loaf\", a deli meat which contains both macaroni and processed cheese bits, can be found in some stores.A variety of packaged mixes that are prepared in a sauce pan on the stove or in a microwave oven are available. They are usually modeled on Kraft Macaroni & Cheese (known as Kraft Dinner or KD in Canada), which was introduced in 1937 with the slogan \"make a meal for four in nine minutes.\" It was an immediate success in the US and Canada amidst the economic hardships of the Depression. During the Second World War, rationing led to increased popularity for the product which could be obtained two boxes for one food rationing stamp. The 1953 Better Homes and Gardens Cookbook includes a recipe using Velveeta, which had been reformulated in that year. The boxed Kraft product is popular in Canada, where it is the most-purchased grocery item in the country.Boxed mixes consist of uncooked pasta and either a liquid cheese sauce (often labeled \"deluxe\") or powdered ingredients to prepare it. The powdered cheese sauce is mixed with either milk or water, and margarine, butter, or olive oil and added to the cooked pasta. Some mixes prepared in a microwave cook the pasta in the sauce. Another popular variant is jarred macaroni cheese sauce, which is especially popular in the UK and US, available under the Dolmio and Ragú brands, among others. The pasta is purchased and prepared separately, then mixed with the heated cheese sauce. Powdered cheese sauce, very similar to what is found inside a box of macaroni and cheese mix, is also sold without the pasta. This product is produced by several companies, most notably Bisto, Cabot, Annie\\'s and Kraft Foods. Canned or tinned macaroni and cheese is available in supermarkets in the US and UK, with Heinz being the most prominent brand in the UK. These are often served on toast as a snack or as part of a breakfast. A number of different products on the market use this basic formulation with minor variations in ingredients.Although high in carbohydrates, calories, fat, and salt, macaroni and cheese is a source of protein and certain variations of the dish can decrease the negative health aspects. == See also == == References == == Further reading == Carroll, Linda (July 17, 2017). \"How harmful are the chemicals in your boxes of mac and cheese?\".

              " 'Angelino Medoro (1567–1631) was an Italian painter during the 17th-century, active in Latin America. His work in the Viceroyalty of Peru was greatly influential on the Cuzco School art movement. == Biography == Angelino Medoro was born in 1567 in present-day Italy, however there is conflicting information on the city of birth. He was born in either Rome, which was part of Papal States during this time; or Naples, which was part of the Kingdom of Sicily. Medoro is thought to have studied art in Rome, followed by travelled to Seville, and to New Kingdom of Granada (present-day Colombia). His only surviving European artwork was the painting \"Flagellation of Christ\" (1586) in Seville.Medoro, alongside Bernardo Bitti, and Matteo da Lecce (or Matteo Pérez de Alesio in Spanish) were the three founders of Peruvian colonial painting. His earliest work in the Americas was Virgen de la Antigua (1587–1588) in the Santo Domingo church in Bogotá. In 1617, he painted a portrait of Saint Rosa of Lima at Santuario Santa Rosa de Lima (also known as Church of Santa Rosa in Lima).His students included Pedro de Loayza (or Pedro Loayza), Luis de Riaño, and Juan de Mesa.Medoro returned to Spain after 1620, and died in Seville in 1631. == See also == Pedro Bedón Spanish colonization of the Americas == References == == Further reading == Gutiérrez, Ramón (1995).

              " 'Aħrax Tower (Maltese: Torri tal-Aħrax), originally known as Torre di Lacras, and also known as Armier Tower (Maltese: Torri tal-Armier), Ta\\' Ħoslien Tower (Maltese: Torri ta\\' Ħoslien) or the White Tower (Maltese: Torri l-Abjad), is a small watchtower overlooking Armier Bay in the limits of Mellieħa, Malta. It was built in 1658 as the sixth of the De Redin towers. An artillery battery was built around it in 1715. Today, the tower and battery are intact. After receiving 3 years of restoration work the tower was reopened to the public on the 9th of June 2021. Aħrax Tower is the northernmost fortification on the main island of Malta. == History == Aħrax Tower was built by November 1658 in the area known as \"l-Aħrax tal-Mellieħa\". Construction had cost 589 scudi, 5 tari and 15 grani. Its structure is similar to the other De Redin towers, having a square base and two floors. However, the base of Aħrax Tower is slightly larger than some of the other towers. An escutcheon once stood over the main doorway with De Redin\\'s coat of arms, although this is no longer in place. Just as was the case with Għajn Ħadid Tower, a well was located close to the tower to supply water to the militia stationed in the tower. In 1715, an artillery battery was built around the tower, and it was called Batteria della Harach. The battery consisted of a semicircular gun platform with an en barbette parapet, a blockhouse that was built on the western wall of the tower, and two walls linking the tower to the gun platform. It was surrounded by a rock hewn ditch.In the 1743 inspection, Aħrax Tower was armed with two bronze cannons, gun wheels and stocks, sixteen cannonballs, four muskets, one rotolo of musket balls and ten rotolos of gunpowder. Thirty years later, in 1770, the battery was armed with ten iron cannons with 700 iron balls and 150 grapeshot rounds. The gunpowder was stored in Saint Agatha\\'s Tower. In the 19th century, the British used the tower as a naval station and they added several rooms to the tower\\'s structure. At a point it served as the Governor\\'s summer residence and a British coat of arms replaced De Redin\\'s personal arms. After World War II the tower was privately owned but it was eventually abandoned. == Present day == The area around the tower is now covered with concrete and the foundations of some walls of the battery have never been excavated. Over the years Aħrax Tower was heavily modified so it is now difficult to see which parts are original and which were added later. The battery remains largely intact, with the exception of one of the linking walls. In 2009, the tower was passed to the Mellieħa Local Council.In November 2016 the tower was granted to heritage NGO Din l-Art Ħelwa for a loan period of 10 years, with the scope of this agreement being the conservation, restoration and rehabilitation of the building. The works were finished in June 2021 and the tower was reopened to the general public for educational purposes. == References == == External links == National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands YouTube video showing a 3D model of Aħrax Tower and Battery',\n",

              " 'Tetra-Fang (stylized as TETRA-FANG) is a Japanese pop-rock band considered a \"limited rock unit\" and was formed to perform songs on the soundtrack for the 2008 Kamen Rider Series Kamen Rider Kiva. == History == Tetra-Fang was formed in 2008 to serve as a promotional band for Kamen Rider Kiva. The group composes music in a rock style and features a rotating line-up of members for each of their singles. Koji Seto who portrays Wataru Kurenai, the lead character in Kamen Rider Kiva, serves as Koji, the lead vocalist of the group for the single releases of \"Destiny\\'s Play\" and \"Individual-System.\" \"Destiny\\'s Play\" was released on April 23, 2008, and came with a DVD containing a music video for the song. The single ranked 25th on the Japanese Oricon Weekly Single\\'s Charts in its first week. \"Individual-System\" was released on June 25, 2008, and was the second ending theme for Kamen Rider Kiva.An arrangement of \"Individual-System\" was released one month after the initial release of the original version on July 30, 2008, and featured Keisuke Kato on vocals, known as \"Fight for Justice: Individual-System Nago Ver.\". Also, on August 6, 2008, a mini-album was released, Supernova, after the song of the same name used as Emperor Form\\'s theme song. It also features character songs for Garulu, Basshaa, and Dogga, two of which have been featured as the ending theme in the series. In early December, the band released their first and only fully original album entitled Destiny. The album contained numerous character songs written by previous tokusatsu songwriters including Ryo and Shuhei Naruse. The album also included the tracks Destiny\\'s Play, Individual System, Roots of the King and Supernova from previous releases. Also in December, another album was released called Inherited System, which contained character songs sung by actors who have used the IXA System in the TV series. Two Tetra-Fang songs were included in the release, which were Individual System and Fight for Justice. The group officially disbanded after Kamen Rider Kiva had completed its broadcasting, however both keyboardist Shuhei and guitarist Ayano continue to be involved in the musical side of the Kamen Rider franchise. Shuhei and Ayano reunited as part of the Kamen Rider Decade series, producing three albums of cover versions of previous Kamen Rider theme songs. The songs arranged by Shuhei featured Ayano on guitar. Both musicians have since continued providing their musical services for the franchise, composing and performing several songs featured in the various series. The popularity of the group however resulted in a reunion for a final album consisting mostly of covers of previous Tetra-Fang songs. The album however, entitled Masked Rider Kiva Destiny\\'s Play Re-Union, did include three original songs; two sung by Kivat and the final track sung by Wataru and Otoya as a duet. == Members == Koji Seto as Koji: vocals Shuhei Naruse as Shuhei: keyboard Yuji: lead guitar (\"Destiny\\'s Play\") Roy: bass (\"Destiny\\'s Play\") Ume: bass (\"Individual-System\" & Supernova) Ayano: lead guitar (\"Individual-System\" & Supernova) == Discography == === Singles === \"Destiny\\'s Play\" - April 23, 2008\"Destiny\\'s Play\" \"Destiny\\'s Play Neo Romanesque Guitar Edit\" \"Destiny\\'s Play Additional Kivat-bat the 3rd Edit\" \"Destiny\\'s Play Instrumental\"\"Individual-System\" - June 25, 2008\"Individual-System\" \"Individual-System Technical Guitar Fist\" \"Individual-System Instrumental\" \"Individual-System Nago Advance Fist\"\"Roots of the King\" - November 12, 2008\"Roots of the King\" \"Individual-System Acoustic Fist\" \"Roots of the King Instrumental\" \"Individual-System Acoustic Fist Instrumental\" === Mini-albums === Supernova - August 6, 2008 CD\"Entrance Procession\" \"Supernova [Tribute to Emperor Form]\" \"Shout in the Moonlight [Tribute to Garulu]\" \"Innocent Trap [Tribute to Basshaa]\" \"Silent Shout [Tribute to Dogga]\" \"Message [Tribute to Father]\"DVD\"Entrance Procession\" Music Clip \"Supernova\" Music Clip \"Message\" Music Clip === Albums === Destiny - December 3, 2008\"Mind Garden\"[Tribute to Wataru] \"Destiny\\'s Play\" \"Roots of the King\" \"Lightning to Heaven\" [Tribute to Rook] \"Exterminate Time\" [Tribute to King] \"Eternity Blood\" [Tribute to Bishop] \"Supernova\" \"Individual-System\" \"Rainy Rose\" [Tribute to Queen] \"Prayer: Message2\" \"No Matter Who You Are\" === Other === \"Fight For Justice: Individual-System Nago Ver.\" by Keisuke Nago (Keisuke Kato) - July 30, 2008 For the appearance of Kamen Rider Rising IXA in the series, Keisuke Kato was asked to record a new arrangement/cover of \"Individual-System\" in the character of Nago.

              " 'Burleith is a neighborhood in Washington, D.C., United States. It is bordered by 35th Street NW to the east, Reservoir Road NW and the historic Georgetown district to the south, Whitehaven Park to the north, and Glover Archbold Park to the west. The neighborhood is home to the Duke Ellington School of the Arts and the Washington International School (primary campus). == History == The history of Burleith can be traced back to 1886, when the Huidekoper family came into ownership of the Burleith tract of land. During their tenure as residents, they built a few buildings, but kept most of the land as woods and fields. In 1922 the Huidekopers sold the land to Shannon and Luchs, Inc. Instead of keeping the land in its natural state like the previous owners, Shannon and Luchs decided to hire an architect to develop the area. The architect designed homes with moderate prices between $8,950-$13,500 that were targeted for middle class residents with \"moderate income, but above average taste\". == Burleith Citizens Association == In 1925 the Burleith Citizens Association was developed to deal with civic and social issues concerning the neighborhood. Issues have included parking, noise control, traffic lights, and the relationship with neighboring Georgetown University. The Association also plans social activities, such as picnics and children events. Burleith is in Ward 2 and belongs to ANC 2E along with Georgetown and Hillandale. == Hillandale == To the west of Burleith is a 24-hour gated community called Hillandale; some consider this a separate neighborhood but it is technically part of Burleith. Residents of Hillandale have included U.S. Senators Joseph Lieberman (I-Connecticut) and Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), former NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue and Georgetown University President John J. DeGioia. Prior to 1979, Hillandale was an estate owned by John Dustin Archbold\\'s family. == References == == External links == Burleith.org - neighborhood website Guide to the Burleith Citizens Association records, 1926-2001, Special Collections Research Center, Estelle and Melvin Gelman Library, The George Washington University.

              " 'The willow beauty (Peribatodes rhomboidaria) is a moth of the family Geometridae. It is a common species of Europe and adjacent regions (Near East and the Maghreb). While it is found widely throughout Scandinavian countries, which have a maritime climate, it is absent from parts of the former USSR which are at the same latitude but have a more continental climate. Up to four subspecies are listed by some authors, while others consider the willow beauty a monotypic species or accept only rhomboidaria and sublutearia as distinct: Peribatodes rhomboidaria corsicaria (Schawerda 1931) Peribatodes rhomboidaria defloraria (Dannehl 1928) Peribatodes rhomboidaria rhomboidaria (Denis & Schiffermüller, 1775) Peribatodes rhomboidaria sublutearia (Zerny 1927)Under its junior synonym Geometra rhomboidaria, the willow beauty is the type species of its genus Peribatodes. This was initially proposed as a subgenus of Boarmia but eventually elevated to full genus rank. == Description and ecology == The adult\\'s wingspan is 40–48 mm. The wings of this species are whitish-grey or -yellowish, though they have a buff or grey appearance from a distance, as they are heavily speckled with brown or black dots. Running over the fore- and hindwings in a semicircle are the two blackish bands commonly found in Ennominae, but they are broken and somewhat indistinct in this species. A tell-tale characteristic is a single bulge in the forewing part of the outer blackish bands. Melanic forms (e.g. rebeli) sometimes occur. The sexes can be distinguished by their antennae, which are strongly feathered in the male, but almost smooth in the female. See similar species (below) This moth inhabits woodland, gardens and similar habitat. Either one or two generations occur each year, depending on locality. The adults are on the wing during summer – e.g. June to September on the British Isles, while in the more continental climate of Austria they are rarely seen anymore in late August. They fly at night and are attracted to light.The caterpillar larva is reddish-brown and feeds on a variety of trees and shrubs, but – despite its name – rarely or never on willows (Salix). The species overwinters as a small larva. As evidenced by the species distribution, it does not seem to tolerate severe and dry winters very well. === Recorded food plants === Willow beauty larvae are highly polyphagous and not adapted to a specific lineage of foodplants. Rather, they eat foliage of a wide range of eudicots, as well as some other plants. Recorded foodplants include: Betula (birch) Camellia sinensis (tea) Clematis (clematises) – not in Finland Crataegus (hawthorn) Hedera (ivy) Ligustrum (privet) – not in Finland Malus (apple) Prunus (plum, cherry, peach) – including blackthorn (P. spinosa) – not in Finland – and possibly others Taxus (yew) Vitis (grapevine) == Synonyms == Junior synonyms of the willow beauty include: Geometra rhomboidaria Denis & Schiffermüller, 1775 Boarmia corsicaria Schawerda, 1931 Boarmia defloraria Dannehl, 1928 Peribatodes dragone de Laever & Parenzan, 1986 Boarmia psoralaria Millière, 1885 Boarmia syritaurica Wehrli, 1931 == Similar species == Peribatodes rhomboidaria is difficult to certainly distinguish from its congeners.

              " 'The Big 30 All-Star Football Game is a high school football all-star game held in the Twin Tiers region of Western New York and northern Pennsylvania. The game is held annually each August at Parkway Field on the campus of Bradford Area High School in Bradford, Pennsylvania and is broadcast live on radio station WESB. Each team consists of 43 players from a 15 school-district area in each state (15+15 being the \"30\" indicated in the game\\'s title). New York\\'s team covers mostly Cattaraugus County, portions of Allegany County, and two small districts in southeastern Chautauqua County, while Pennsylvania\\'s team covers a five-county area including Warren, McKean, Cameron, Potter and Elk Counties. This area roughly, though not exactly, corresponds to the coverage area of the Olean Times Herald, the major newspaper serving the region. The players are mostly high school graduates; some go on to play college football but many do not. Unlike most high school football games in New York and Pennsylvania, most games have full fifteen-minute quarters; the standard for most high school games is twelve minutes.Through 2015, there have been 42 contests. New York leads the series 22-18-2. The Empire State defeated the Keystone State by a 46–37 score in the 2010 game, but most recent matches had mostly been won by Pennsylvania, including a 27–0 shutout in 2008, a 13–6 win by the Keystone State in 2009, where Pennsylvania held New York to zero completed passes, and a 28–3 win in 2011 built primarily on two New York fumbles. The 2012 game was won by New York. New York won the 2015 contest by a margin of 44–8, a record for the event.The Big 30 Charities Classic expanded to men\\'s and women\\'s basketball contests in 2015, with the inaugural contests held on March 15, 2015. WGWE broadcast the games, which were held at the high school in Portville, New York. From approximately 2003 to 2015, the football game was named the Don Raabe Big 30 Charities Classic after Don Raabe, one of the founders of the game. Disputes with Raabe\\'s estate, trademark concerns and a decline in funds prompted the game organizers to remove his name from the game\\'s title.The 2020 Edition of the game was cancelled due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. == References == Area players look to earn win for Pennsylvania.

              " 'Sarıkız, Ayışığı, Yakamoz, Eldiven were the names of alleged Turkish military coup plans in 2004. == Plans == In 2007, the Nokta weekly published portions of a diary purportedly belonging to the retired general Özden Örnek, indicating that four coup plans were prepared: Sarıkız (blonde girl; idiomatic for \\'cow\\'), Ayışığı (moonlight), Yakamoz (Sea Sparkle), and Eldiven (glove). some have argued the names are code for army, airforce, navy, and police respectfully Admiral Örnek himself called the diary a forgery. The Armed Forces evaded the issue without denying its authenticity altogether. For his part, general Hurşit Tolon said he found no reason to object to the publication of the diaries since they contained no false statements about him. The diary was not used as evidence in the 2455-page-long indictment. Eldiven indicated a \"discord within the Turkish Armed Forces\" on the matter of supporting coup plans and proposed remedies to overcome it. The main purpose of Eldiven was to \"shape the TSK, Parliament, the bureaucracy and local governments and rewrite the Constitution, the entire legislation and the National Security Policy Document.\" According to the alleged plan, cell organizations of people from different segments of society would be formed. These would be unaware of each other\\'s existence and work without knowing the ultimate purpose for which they were serving. These guerrilla tactics had been employed earlier by the Counter-Guerrilla, the Turkish branch of Operation Gladio. The plan called for psychological warfare to shape public opinion. The first stage of the plan was to ensure national consensus, shaping decisions taken by the Supreme Military Council (Turkish: Yüksek Askerî Şûra, YAŞ) by talking to journalists and having them publish the ideas of active generals. The plan also involved then-President Ahmet Necdet Sezer in shaping the YAŞ.Eldiven proposed to support and use the media to exhaust liberal and democratic political opponents and rally public opinion behind the army\\'s plans. Speaking to the newspaper Taraf, political analyst Ali Bayramoğlu said that the major newspapers were aware of the coup plans, since they had been approached by the generals for support, but that they did not initially write about it. When the generals realized that the broad support they had sought was not forthcoming, they fell into disarray. Şener Eruygur, in particular, drew up a plan to undertake a coup by himself. He is currently under custody. Sarp Kuray, a leftist who was sentenced to life imprisonment after the 1971 coup, likened these plans to the 1971 coup attempt, which had been thwarted by intelligence reaching the Chief of Staff, Memduh Tağmaç. == Authenticity == The diary was corroborated by minutes of the meeting on which the diary was based, which were found in the home of retired captain Muzaffer Yıldırım. Along with Tolon and Eruygur, Yıldırım was detained as part of an investigation into a conspiratorial organization named \"Ergenekon\".The diary was not mentioned in the Ergenekon indictment. Görmüş said this was because the diary was obtained illegally and therefore inadmissible in a court of law. == Selected quotes == The newspaper Today\\'s Zaman reproduced portions of the diary: ... Upon the suggestion of Gendarmerie Forces Commander Gen. Şener Eruygur, we went to the social facilities of the gendarmerie. (...) We decided to form an action plan on our own. We were first going to take control of the media, so I was going to invite M.Ö. for that purpose. We were going to keep in contact with rectors and arrange for students to engage in demonstrations. We were going to act in unison with unions. We were going to get posters hung in the streets. We were going to contact associations and incite them against the government. We were going to do all of this across the country, and it would be known as Sarıkız. ... They all gathered at the headquarters of the gendarmerie, and Gen. Eruygur showed them the preparations I had been shown on Tuesday and had them listen to a number of voice recordings that belong to some high-ranking government officials. Most of them were advisors to the Justice and Development Party and in the recordings they share their ideas on how they are planning to handle the Cyprus problem. At the end of the briefing, the commander of the Air Forces (Gen. İbrahim Fırtına) and the commander of the Gendarmerie Forces (Eruygur) started pressing for a revolution on March 10. (...) Eruygur\\'s target is to become the commander of the Land Forces. (...) The current commander of the Land Forces (Gen. Aytaç Yalman) told me how Eruygur is digging a pit for (Chief of General Staff Gen.) Yaşar (Büyükanıt). To me, the commander of the Gendarmerie Forces was acting a little unfairly and in an overly ambitious manner. ... We gathered in my house with the commanders of the air forces, the navy, the army and the gendarmerie forces at 2 p.m. … The second topic again turned out to be the same one, \\'We should topple these fellows,\\' was what we discussed. Şener and the air guy (Fırtına) are pressing too much for this. Şener can\\'t get it out of his mind; he repeats the same thing every two words. So does the air guy. If we don\\'t want to give away Cyprus, our furthest limit is April 9, 2004. Whatever we must do, we should do before that. == Ergenekon charges == These excerpts were later cited as key evidence in the March 2009 indictment of a round of suspects, including retired generals Eruygur and Tolon, arrested in the course of the ongoing investigations into the alleged illegal Ergenekon organization and charged with plotting to overthrow the legal government of the Republic of Turkey. == References == == External links == Full text of coup diaries, as published in \"İşte darbe günlüklerinin tam metni\".

              " 'Mit\\'a (Quechua pronunciation: [ˈmɪˌtʼa]) was mandatory service in the society of the Inca Empire. Its close relative, the regionally mandatory Minka is still in use in Quechua communities today and known as faena in Spanish. Historians use the Hispanicized term mita to differentiate the system as it was modified and intensified by the Spanish colonial government, creating the encomienda system. Mit\\'a was effectively a form of tribute to the Inca government in the form of labor, i.e. a corvée. Tax labor accounted for much of the Inca state tax revenue; beyond that, it was used for the construction of the road network, bridges, agricultural terraces, and fortifications in ancient Peru. Military service was also mandatory. All citizens who could perform labor were required to do so for a set number of days out of a year (the basic meaning of the word mit\\'a is a regular turn or a season). The Inca Empire\\'s wealth meant a family often needed only 65 days to farm; the rest of the year was devoted entirely to the mit\\'a. A relative of the Mit\\'a (federal work) is the modern Quechua system of Minka or faena, which is mostly applied at small-scale villages. The Minka was adopted during the 1960s on large-scale federal projects of Peru. == Religious worship == The Incas elaborated creatively on a preexisting system of not only the mit\\'a exchange of labor but also the exchange of the objects of religious veneration of the peoples whom they took into their empire. This exchange ensured proper compliance among conquered peoples. In this instance, wak\\'as and paqarinas became significant centers of shared worship and a point of unification of their ethnically and linguistically diverse empire, bringing unity and citizenship to often geographically disparate peoples. That eventually led to a system of pilgrimages throughout all of these various shrines by the indigenous people of the empire prior to the introduction of Catholicism. Enormous construction of highways and structures were possible in part only by the use of the mit\\'a. All the people worked for the government for a certain period of time. This labor was free for the Inca Rule. During the Inca period, men were required to work 65 days in the field to provide food for his family. When someone\\'s turn came, he joined the various works that used the mit\\'a. A communal type of elemental provisions and needs was set up in order to care for the families of those who were absent in their Mita turn. People worked in building highways, the construction of homes for the emperor and nobility, monuments, bridges, fields belonging to priests and the emperor, and mines. == System == All males starting at the age of fifteen were required to participate in the mit\\'a to do public services. This remained mandatory until the age of fifty. However, the Inca rule was flexible on the amount of time one could share on the mit\\'a turn. Overseers were responsible to make sure that a person after fulfilling his duty in the mit\\'a still had enough time to care for his own land and family. The construction of bridges and oroyas was the responsibility of the local ethnic groups, who divided the work according to the mita system, with the population divided into hanan and urin or ichuq (ichoc) and allawqa (allauca) (upper and lower, left and right). During viceregal times, the Andean method of distributing labor obligations among the ethnic groups was preserved, which permitted the continued maintenance of these public works. The war mit\\'a took men from their ayllus to serve in the state armies. All labor in the Andean world was performed as a rotational service, whether for maintaining the tampus, roads, bridges or for guarding the storehouses or other such tasks. The craftspeople enjoyed a special status in the Inca state. Although they worked for the state, they did not take part in the agricultural or war mit\\'a. The agrarian mit\\'a was distinct from the fishing mit\\'a, and these labor groups never intervened in each other\\'s occupations. In the señorio of Chincha, the fishermen numbered ten thousand, and went to sea in turns, the rest of the time enjoying themselves by dancing and drinking. The Spaniard criticized them as lazy drunkards because they did not go to sea daily and all at once. The mining mit\\'a was also fulfilled at the level of ayllus, of the local lord, and, in the last instance, of the state. The significance of the term mit\\'a goes beyond that of the system for organizing labor. It contains a certain Andean philosophical concept of eternal repetition. The constellation of the Pleiades, called cabrillas (\"little goats\") by the Spaniards, were known as unquy (Quechua for \"disease\", Hispanicized oncoy) during the rainy season mit\\'a, and as qullqa (Quechua for \"storehouse\") during the season of harvest and abundance. The seasons were divided into the dry mit\\'a and the rainy mit\\'a. The day mit\\'a succeeded the night mit\\'a in a repetition that reflected an ordering of time that the natives conceptualized as a cyclical organizational system of order and chaos. == Categorization of lands == During the Inca period people were mostly dependent on the cultivation of their land. All the fields of the Empire were divided into four categories: the Field of the Temple, the Emperor, Kurakas (Curacas), and People. Fields of the people were fields that belonged to the sick, widows, the elderly, wives of the soldiers and that of his own land. At the beginning of plowing time, people started to work first at the fields of widows, of sick people and of wives of the soldiers under the direction of the village overseers. Then, they worked on their own field. Next, they worked on the Temples fields and Kuraka fields and finally, they set to work on the Emperor\\'s fields. While they worked on the Emperor\\'s field, they typically wore their best dress and men and women chanted songs in praise to the Inca. When people were engaged in war, their fields were cultivated by people engaged in mit\\'a. That way, soldiers would go to war with their fields and family secured and protected, which enhanced the loyalty and the focus on the part of Incan soldiers. == Spanish rule == Under the Viceroy Francisco de Toledo, communities were required to provide one seventh of their male labor force at any given time for public works, mines and agriculture. The system became an intolerable burden on the Inca communities and abuses were common. Complaints and revolts occurred and new laws were passed by Philip III but they only had a limited effect. The Inca and Spanish mitas served different purposes. The Inca mit\\'a provided public goods, such as maintenance of road networks and sophisticated irrigation and cropping systems that required intercommunity coordination of labor. The majority of Inca subjects performed their mit\\'a obligations in or near their home communities, often in agriculture; service in mines was extremely rare. In contrast, the Spanish mita acted as a subsidy to private mining interests and the Spanish nation, which used tax revenues from silver production largely to finance European wars.A 2021 study in the Journal of Economic History found that the colonial mita system in Peru caused the decimation of the male native-born population. == Working in mines == The Spanish conquistadors also used the same labor system to supply the workforce they needed for the silver mines, which was the basis of their economy in the colonial period. Under the leadership of Viceroy Francisco de Toledo, who was dispatched to Peru in 1569, the mit\\'a system greatly expanded as Toledo sought to increase silver outputs from the Potosí silver mine. Toledo recognized that without a steady, reliable and inexpensive source of labor, mining would not be able to grow at the speed that the Spanish crown had requested. Under Toledo\\'s leadership, the first mita recruits arrived in Potosí in 1573 from the regions directly surrounding the Potosi mine. At its peak, recruitment for the Potosi mita extended to an area that was nearly 200,000 square miles (520,000 km2) and included much of southern Peru and present-day Bolivia. The conquistadors used the concept of mit\\'a to suit their own needs. Mit\\'a is considered to be the ancient and original version of mandatory state service. The Spanish mita system had severe impacts on the native population, which was of able-bodied workers at a time while their communities were experiencing demographic collapse from epidemics of Old World diseases. It also resulted in natives fleeing their communities to evade the mit\\'a. With fewer workers able to work the fields, the farming production went down, resulting in famine and malnutrition for many native communities in the region. Research by Melissa Dell found that the mining mita resulted in negative long-term effects for the regions where it occurred. This included lower levels of education and household consumption, less developed road networks, and a decrease in public good provision (due to there being very few haciendas, whose owners generally supported greater provision of public goods). == Mitma resettlement system == The mit\\'a labor tribute is not to be confused with the related Inca policy of deliberate resettlements referred to by the Quechua word mitma (mitmaq means \"outsider\" or \"newcomer\") or its Hispanicized forms, mitima or mitimaes (plural). That involved transplanting whole groups of people of Inca background as colonists into new lands inhabited by newly conquered peoples. The aim was to distribute loyal Inca subjects throughout their empire to limit the threat of localized rebellions. == Lasting effects == Mita districts historically achieved lower levels of education, and today, they remain less integrated into road networks. Finally, data from the most recent agricultural census document that residents of mita districts are substantially more likely to be subsistence farmers since haciendas, rural estates with an attached labor force, were banned in mita districts to minimize the competition the state faced in accessing scarce mita labor. It was the hacienda elite that possessed the political connections required to secure public goods such as roads. The hacienda elites were the ones who were lobbying for roads as many haciendas as possible, and empirical evidence links roads to increased market participation and higher household income.The fact that farmers from mit\\'a districts do not have greater access to paved roads means that they are unable to transport crops to larger, regional markets. It is unlikely that these farmers simply do not wish to participate in the market. In the case of Peru, throughout the 1980s, Shining Path, as part of their Maoist ideology, attempted to turn farmers away from commercial farming; their efforts were largely unpopular and met with resistance.More recently, in 2004, residents of Ilave, a mita district, lynched their local mayor, in part for his inability to follow through with promises to pave the town\\'s access road and build a local market. Overall, former mita districts suffer from lower economic performance, as demonstrated by generally lower household consumption and increased rates of stunted growth. Without haciendas to compete with the more exploitative Spanish system, mita districts were subjected to greater economic and health pressures from their labor. Melissa Dell has shown that the repercussions of this disparity have persisted past the end of the mita system as mit\\' districts were less integrated with the greater road network. == Government application in modern Peru == The only example of re-applying the Inca-style Mit\\'a in a modern state, as a government policy, occurred in Peru during the two Popular Action governments under President Fernando Belaúnde Terry (1963 - 1968 and 1980 - 1985). Under this government, a state institution called \"Popular Cooperation\" was launched, strongly inspired by the strategy of labor tribute in the Incan mit\\'a. During the 10 years this institution operated, more infrastructure projects were accomplished in Peru than in most of the 140-year Republican era (from 1821 to 1963). The results were hundreds of kilometers of roads, aqueducts, communal and municipal works and other infrastructure pieces. === Popular cooperation === The principle of the institution was quite simple: given the rather scarce economic resources of the Peruvian State in the early 1960s, the public works that this institution would do should have been \"co-financed\" by the beneficiaries, namely through contributions of labor. In any given public works project in Peru, it is estimated that between 60 and 70% of the cost goes to the acquisition of materials, and the remaining 30-40% are labor costs. Applying the principle of the Incan mit\\'a , the government fronted the acquisition of goods, and the beneficiaries provided the labor services without salary; this allowed the Peruvian State to save 30-40% for public works during this period - these savings were invested in further public works projects. The beneficiaries in turn contributed their communal workforce in exchange for accelerated development of their communities and the expansion of infrastructure in Peru. === South Korean commission === In 1964, the government of the Republic of Korea became aware of the significant results achieved in Peru, and sent a commission to meet with the Peruvian government. The commission studied the methodology and organization of the Peruvian labor tribute institution and the feasibility of applying it to the Republic of Korea. After a few months in Peru, the commission returned to South Korea and rolled out their own modern version of the Incan mit\\'a to Korean production systems, including the manufacturing industry. The results obtained in Korea were even more positive than those obtained in Peru due to a different development approach. == See also == Mink\\'a (Quechuan mandatory communal work, also known as faena) Ayni (Quechuan personal reciprocity) Repartimiento Encomienda Corvée Tribute == Notes == == References ==',\n",

              " 'Cora Mae Bryant (May 1, 1926 – October 30, 2008) was an American blues musician. She was the daughter of another American blues musician, Curley Weaver. Bryant released two solo albums in her lifetime on the Music Maker label.Part of her home in Oxford, Georgia, was thought of as a \\'blues museum\\'. Her own music largely derived from the influence of attending impromptu performances and house parties, including her father, plus Blind Willie McTell, Buddy Moss, and other local blues musicians of the early 1930s. == Biography == She was born Cora Mae Weaver in Oxford, Newton County, Georgia, United States. She was the daughter of Curley Weaver, and started singing at the age of six in the New Bethel Baptist Church in Walnut Grove, Georgia. With her father often absent performing and recording, Bryant was part-raised by her grandmother, Savannah Shepard, who lived in Almon, Georgia. Bryant often spent days and nights with her grandmother, who had both a piano and guitar, and often played them and sang to entertain the young girl. Bryant maintained that was where her father had earlier obtained his own basic musical intuition. She once said, \"When the weekend came, Daddy would come and get me. We did not know the difference between night and day.\"She started attending fish fries and barbecues around her home state with her father, and through these connections got to meet Buddy Moss, Blind Willie McTell and others, including the unrecorded guitarist Johnny Guthrie. They played generally outside for the entertainment of locals and Bryant obtained her education in Georgia blues. She later found casual employment in her mid-twenties, with her father picking cotton for a living. Curley Weaver died in 1962. Bryant began to perform in her own right, although one researcher wryly noted that \"Clyde Langford and Cora Mae Bryant, kin to Lightnin\\' Hopkins and Curley Weaver respectively, but very distant from them in talent\". Her own songwriting was slow to get started, but Bryant found the process easy to accomplish. She stated \"I don\\'t get no pencil and write \\'em. One song, we was sittin\\' up there just talkin\\', me and my granddaughter, and I said, \"Yeah, if you got anything in layaway, you better get it out.\" And I made a song of that\". Also, Bryant\\'s knowledge of early blues in Atlanta and Georgia, was used as a source by the music historians Peter B. Lowry and Bruce Bastin. Her own recording career was late in commencing before Dave Peabody\\'s 1997 album, Down in Carolina, contained a guest appearance from Bryant on her penned track, \"McTell, Moss, & Weaver\".She gradually became important on the Atlanta blues scene; performing, organizing \"Giving It Back\" festivals at the city\\'s Northside Tavern to honor early blues artists, and as a frequent caller to local blues radio shows. In addition, her collection of memorabilia continued to expand; \"... a little pale gray bench, that she said Blind Willie McTell used to sit on to play\" was donated to Bryant\\'s \\'museum\\' housed in a side room in her home in Oxford. Bryant was the subject of articles in both Living Blues magazine in February 1998 and in Music Makers in 2002.In 2001, Bryant recorded her debut album, Born with the Blues, which was released on the supportive Music Maker label. In July 2002, Bryant appeared at the Mississippi Valley Blues Festival, accompanied by the guitarist Josh Jacobson, performing songs from Born with the Blues. Her song \"You Was Born to Die\" had previously appeared on the compilation album, fRoots 7 (1996), while \"It Was Weaver\" appeared on Soul Bag N°192 (2008). Further tracks were included on Music Maker\\'s own compilation, Sisters of the South (2003). Her own second label, Born in Newton County, came out the same year.In 2005, Bryant was living at home in Oxford when suffered a stroke. She died of natural causes on the morning of October 30, 2008, at the age of 82. == Legacy == Bryant\\'s track, \"Born to Die\" was played by Cerys Matthews on the UK\\'s BBC Radio 2 in April 2015. \"It Was Weaver\" had been aired in June 2014, on a NTS Radio show hosted by Charlie Bones. == Discography == == References == == External links == Painting and videos @ Northsidetavern.com Family placed death notice',\n",

              " \"The Wisconsin Wolfpack was an American football franchise based in Wisconsin. The Wolfpack name and brand was used for two teams: an indoor football team in the Continental Indoor Football League and a traditional (outdoor) football team in the Mid Continental Football League. The indoor team played its home games at the Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Madison, Wisconsin in its inaugural season of 2009, but moved to the Hartmeyer Arena for the 2010 season. The outdoor team was somewhat nomadic throughout its history with regards to where it played its home games, however, outdoor games were generally played in the Milwaukee metropolitan area. == Indoor history == Prior to the Wolfpack franchise's 2008 outdoor campaign, the Milwaukee Bonecrushers of the Continental Indoor Football League approached the Wolfpack coaches and staff and asked them to assist with the completion of their 2008 season following Gilbert Brown's decision to resign as head coach and the resulting resignation of most of the Bonecrushers' staff. Kopac assumed the role of general manager for the Bonecrushers, and brought with him the core coaches of the Wolfpack outdoor team that would later become the core of the Wolfpack indoor team. Kopac led the team to its only win, a 51-46 victory of the Muskegon Thunder. With infrastructure already in place from the outdoor team, and following the previous year's experience with the Bonecrushers, Wolfpack management announced in early 2009 it would field both indoor and outdoor teams that year. To start the indoor team, Kopac coordinated with Lowe Entertainment, owners of the Rock River Raptors, also in the CIFL, to have Lowe run the indoor franchise while retaining Kopac as head coach. The Wolfpack were Madison's second indoor football franchise and the first to call Madison home since the Madison Mad Dogs folded in 2001. The Wolfpack played its inaugural season's home games at the Veterans Memorial Coliseum on the campus of the Alliant Energy Center and used AstroTurf previously belonging to the Pensacola Barracudas of AF2. In its inaugural season, the team finished 7-5 and qualified for the CIFL Playoffs, The team started 5-1 but struggled late in the season after former All-American UW-Platteville quarterback Tom Stetzer was lost to injury. The Wolfpack would fall to the eventual undefeated CIFL champion Chicago Slaughter in the 2009 CIFL Western Conference Championship Game, 63-19. For 2010, the Wolfpack chose to move its home games to the Hartmeyer Arena on the northeast side of Madison. 2010 also saw the team stock its roster with more players from the nearby Wisconsin Badgers football program. Joining defensive lineman Kurt Ware and linebacker James Kamoku from the 2009 Wolfpack would be tight end Andy Crooks, safety Josh Nettles, defensive lineman Ricky Garner, offensive lineman Kenny Jones and, following a season-ending injury to quarterback Brian Ryczkowski, Matt Schabert. Under Schabert's guidance, the Wolfpack had its most successful season to date, indoor or outdoor, finishing the regular season 8-2 and becoming the only team to defeat the then-undefeated Cincinnati Commandos. The Wolfpack would win its first-ever home playoff game, beating the Fort Wayne FireHawks, 25-24, before falling to the Commandos in the 2010 CIFL Championship Game, 54-40, in Cincinnati. == Season-by-season == == Outdoor Wolfpack == === Season-by-season === == Racine Raiders merger == After much speculation, the Racine Journal Times reported on December 9, 2010, that Jordan Kopac would return to coaching the Racine Raiders in 2011. This effectively marked the end of the Wolfpack as a franchise. == References ==\",\n",

              " 'The Efficiency Medal (South Africa) was instituted in 1930 for award to part-time warrant officers, non-commissioned officers and men after twelve years of efficient service on the active list of the Citizen Force of the Union of South Africa. At the same time, a clasp was instituted for award to holders of the medal upon completion of further periods of six years of efficient service. The medal superseded the Colonial Auxiliary Forces Long Service Medal.The Efficiency Medal (South Africa) was superseded by the John Chard Medal in 1952. == Origin == In 1896, the Volunteer Long Service Medal for India and the Colonies was instituted by Queen Victoria. It was superseded by the Colonial Auxiliary Forces Long Service Medal in 1899. == Institution == The Efficiency Medal (South Africa) was instituted by Royal Warrant on 23 September 1930, as a long service award for part-time warrant officers, non-commissioned officers and men of the Citizen Force of the Union Defence Forces. At the same time, a clasp was instituted, for award to recipients of the medal upon completion of further periods of efficient service.The medal bears a subsidiary title to denote that the recipient qualified for its award while serving in the Citizen Force in South Africa. The subsidiary title, in English and Afrikaans, is inscribed on a scroll bar attached to the medal suspender.The similar award for officers was the Efficiency Decoration (South Africa). == Award criteria == The medal could be awarded to part-time warrant officers, non-commissioned officers and men after twelve years of continuous efficient service as a volunteer on the active list of the Citizen Force. Service in West Africa, natives of West Africa and periods spent on leave excluded, and war service were reckoned two-fold as qualifying service for the medal. Service during the period from 3 September 1939 to 1 March 1950 inclusive need not have been continuous, while breaks in service under certain specified conditions, though not counting as qualifying service, were not considered as a break in the twelve years of continuous qualifying service for the medal.Clasps could initially be awarded to holders of the medal upon completion of eighteen and twenty-four reckoned years of efficient service. This was amended on 26 August 1944 to authorise the award of additional clasps for each additional completed period of six years of efficient service after twenty-four years. When medals are not worn, recipients of clasps would wear a silver rosette on the ribbon bar to donate each clasp.A further amendment, on 10 May 1946, made part-time officers who served during the Second World War also eligible for the award of the medal and clasp, provided they were serving on the active list of the Citizen Force on 2 September 1939 and were embodied or called up for war service. The reason for this amendment originated from the anomaly that, during the war, a large number of officers were commissioned from the ranks, and merely by the fact that they were so promoted owing to their efficiency, would be denied the right to the Efficiency Medal. Such officers were allowed to reckon their service as officers as qualifying service for the medal and clasps. Officers who had already qualified for the award of the Efficiency Decoration before that date were, however, not eligible.The medal was initially only awarded to Citizen Force members of the South African Army and South African Air Force. On 1 August 1942, when the South African Navy was established by the consolidation of the Seaward Defence Force and the South African Division of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve into the South African Naval Forces, eligibility for the award of the medal was extended to South African Naval Citizen Force members. == Order of wear == In the order of wear prescribed by the British Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood, the Efficiency Medal (South Africa) ranks on par with the British Efficiency Medal and takes precedence after the Territorial Efficiency Medal and before the Special Reserve Long Service and Good Conduct Medal. === South Africa === With effect from 6 April 1952, when a new South African set of decorations and medals was instituted to replace the British awards used to date, the older British decorations and medals which were applicable to South Africa continued to be worn in the same order of precedence but, with the exception of the Victoria Cross, took precedence after all South African decorations and medals awarded to South Africans on or after that date. Of the official British medals which were applicable to South Africans, the Efficiency Medal (South Africa) takes precedence as shown. Preceded by the Efficiency Decoration (South Africa) (ED). Succeeded by the Decoration for Officers of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (VRD). == Description == The medal was struck in silver and is oval, 39 millimetres (1.54 inches) high and 32 millimetres (1.26 inches) wide. The fixed suspender bar, a pair of laurel leaves, is affixed to the medal by means of a single-toe claw and a horizontal pin through the upper edge of the medal. The suspender is decorated on the obverse with a scroll-pattern bar, inscribed with the name of the country. The name of the recipient was impressed on the rim of the medal. ObverseThree versions of the medal were produced for South Africa, but only the first two were awarded. The obverse has a raised rim on all three versions and bears the crowned effigy of the reigning monarch. The original version has the effigy of King George V in coronation robes and wearing the Tudor Crown. It is circumscribed \"GEORGIVS•V•D•G•BRITT•OMN REX•ET•INDIÆ•IMP•\". The initials \"BM\" at the bottom of the effigy are those of the designer of the obverse, Sir Bertram Mackennal KCVO, an Australian sculptor. The King George VI version was introduced after his succession to the throne in 1936 and has his effigy in coronation robes and wearing the Tudor Crown, facing left and circumscribed \"GEORGIVS•VI•D•G•BR•OMN•REX•ET•INDIÆ•IMP•\". It is identical to the first King George VI obverse design of the British Efficiency Medal. The initials \"PM\" below the effigy are those of the designer of the obverse, sculptor Percy Metcalfe CVO RDI. The Queen Elizabeth II version was introduced after her succession to the throne in 1952 and has her effigy, facing right and wearing the Tudor Crown. It is circumscribed \"ELIZABETH II D: G: BR: OMN: REGINA F: D:\" reading around from the top. It is identical to the first Queen Elizabeth II obverse design of the British Efficiency Medal.Scroll barApproved by a Royal Warrant dated 29 December 1939, the scroll bar inscription on the King George VI version of the medal was in English and Afrikaans, \"UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA\" and \"UNIE VAN SUID-AFRIKA\" in two lines. The scroll bar on the Queen Elizabeth II version was English only, but this medal was never awarded since it was superseded within a few months of the Queen\\'s succession to the throne. ReverseThe reverse is smooth with a raised rim and bears the inscription \"FOR EFFICIENT SERVICE\" in three lines. On the bilingual King George VI version, the Afrikaans and English inscriptions are \"VIR BEKWAME DIENS\" and \"FOR EFFICIENT SERVICE\", each language in three lines and the languages separated by a 13 millimetres long line. ClaspThe clasp, struck in silver, is decorated with an embossed Tudor Crown and was designed to be sewn onto the medal ribbon. RibbonThe ribbon is 32 millimetres wide and dark green, edged with 3 millimetres wide lime yellow bands. == Discontinuation == On 6 April 1952, the Efficiency Medal was superseded by the John Chard Medal, which could be awarded to all ranks after twelve years of continuous efficient service in the Citizen Force. == References ==',\n",
              " \"Physical media refers to the physical materials that are used to store or transmit information in data communications. These physical media are generally physical objects made of materials such as copper or glass. They can be touched and felt, and have physical properties such as weight and color. For a number of years, copper and glass were the only media used in computer networking. The term physical media can also be used to describe data storage media like records, cassettes, VHS, LaserDiscs, CDs, DVDs, and Blu-rays, especially when compared with modern streaming media or content that has been downloaded from the Internet onto a hard drive or other storage device as files. == Types of physical media == === Copper wire === Copper wire is currently the most commonly used type of physical media due to the abundance of copper in the world, as well as its ability to conduct electrical power. Copper is also one of the cheaper metals which makes it more feasible to use.Most copper wires used in data communications today have eight strands of copper, organized in unshielded twisted pairs, or UTP. The wires are twisted around one another because it reduces electrical interference from outside sources. In addition to UTP, some wires use shielded twisted pairs (STP), which reduce electrical interference even further. The way copper wires are twisted around one another also has an effect on data rates. Category 3 cable (Cat3), has three to four twists per foot and can support speeds of 10 Mbit/s. Category 5 cable (Cat5) is newer and has three to four twists per inch, which results in a maximum data rate of 100 Mbit/s. In addition, there are category 5e (Cat5e) cables which can support speeds of up to 1,000 Mbit/s, and more recently, category 6 cables (Cat6), which support data rates of up to 10,000 Mbit/s (i.e., 10 Gbit/s).On average, copper wire costs around $1 per foot. === Optical fiber === Optical fiber is a thin and flexible piece of fiber made of glass or plastic. Unlike copper wire, optical fiber is typically used for long-distance data communications, being that it allows for data transmission over far distances and can produce high transmission speeds. Optical fiber also does not require signal repeaters, which ends up reducing maintenance costs, since signal repeaters are known to fail often.There are two major types of optical fiber in use today. Multimode fiber is approximately 62.5 µm in diameter and utilizes light-emitting diodes to carry signals over a maximum distance of about 2 kilometers. Single mode fiber is approximately 10 µm in diameter and is capable of carrying signals over tens of miles.Like copper wire, optical fiber currently costs about $1 per foot. === Coaxial cables === Coaxial cables have two different layers surrounding a copper core. The inner most layer has an insulator. The next layer has a conducting shield. These are both covered by a plastic jacket. Coaxial cables are used for microwaves, televisions and computers. This was the second transmission medium to be introduced (often called coax), around the mid-1920s. In the center of a coaxial cable is a copper wire that acts as a conductor, where the information travels. The copper wire in coax is thicker than that in twisted-pair, and it is also unaffected by surrounding wires that contribute to electromagnetic interference, so it can provide higher transmission rates than the twisted-pair. The center conductor is surrounded by plastic insulation, which helps filter out extraneous interference. This insulation is covered by a return path, which is usually braided-copper shielding or aluminum foil type covering. Outer jackets form a protective covering for coax; the number and type of outer jackets depend on the intended use of the cable (e.g., whether the cable is supposed to be strung in the air or underground, whether rodent protection is required). The two most popular types of coaxial cabling are used with Ethernet networks. Thinnet is used on Ethernet 10BASE2 networks and is the thinner and more flexible of the two. Unlike a thicknet, it uses a Bayonet Niell-Concelman (BNC) on each end to connect to computers. Thinnet is part of the RG-58 family of cable with a maximum cable length of 185 meters and transmission speeds of 10 Mbit/s. Thicknet coaxial cabling is used with Ethernet 10BASE5 networks, has a maximum cable length of 500 meters and transmission speeds of 10 Mbit/s. It's expensive and not commonly used, though it was originally used to directly connect computers. The computer is connected to the transceiver at the cable from the attachment unit interface of its network card using a drop cable. Maximum thicknet nodes are 100 on a segment. One end of each cable is grounded. ==== Application ==== In the midst of the 1920s, coax was applied to telephone networks as inter-office trunks. Rather than adding more copper cable bundles with 1500 or 1000 pairs of copper wire and cable in them, it was possible to replace those big cables with much smaller coaxial cable. The next major use of coax in telecommunications occurred in the 1950s, when it was deployed as submarine cable to carry international traffic. It was then introduced into the data processing realm in the mid 1960s. Early computer architectures required coax as the media type from the terminal to the host. Local area networks were predominantly based on coax from 1980 to about 1987.Coax has also been used in cable TV and the local loop, in the form of HFC architecture. HFC brings fiber as close as possible to the neighborhood. Fiber terminates at the neighborhood node, where coax fans out to provide home service. ==== Advantages ==== Broadband system-coax has sufficient frequency range to support multiple channels, allowing greater throughput. Greater channel capacity - each of the multiple channels offers substantial capacity depending on the service location (6 MHz wide in North America, 8 MHz wide in Europe). Greater bandwidth - compared to twisted pairs, it has greater bandwidth for each channel. This allows it to support a mixed range of services (voice, data, video, multimedia). Lower error rates - the inner conductor serves as a Faraday shield that protects the network from electronic noise. ==== Disadvantages ==== The bus network on which coax is deployed is susceptible to congestion, noise and security risks. Great noise - the return path has some noise problems, and the end equipment requires added intelligence to take care of error control. High installation costs Susceptible to damage from lightning strikes - if lightning is conducted by a coaxial cable, it could very easily damage the equipment at the end of it. == Debate on physical media == With technology constantly changing, there is a debate on whether physical media is still prudent and necessary to an increasingly wireless world. Wireless and physical media may actually complement each other, and physical media will matter more, not less, in a society dominated by the wireless technology. However, other opinions consider physical media a dead technology that will eventually disappear. == References ==\",\n",

He then attended Columbia University in New York, New York, from 1915 to 1917, and received a Master of Science degree in electrical engineering from the university in 1917. === World War I === After the United States entered World War I on 6 April 1917, Beary served in the Atlantic on convoy duty and in antisubmarine warfare against German submarines, commanding the armed yacht USS Remlik (SP-157) from 1917 to 1918 and then the destroyer USS Lamson in 1918. He received the Navy Cross in 1918 for distinguished service as commanding officer of Remlik and Lamson in the Atlantic campaign. === Interwar === A lieutenant commander by the end of World War I, Beary\\'s first post-war assignment was duty at the U.S. Navy Bureau of Navigation from 1919 to 1921. He then commanded three destroyers, USS Talbot (DD-114) in 1921, USS Parrott (DD-218) from 1921 to 1922, and USS Sumner (DD-333) from 1922 to 1923. From 1923 to 1924 he served ashore at the United States Department of the Navy in Washington, D.C., in the Division of Fleet Training, Navy Operations. He then returned to sea with duty aboard the battleship USS New Mexico (BB-40) from 1925 to 1927, seeing service in the Second Nicaraguan Campaign.From 1928 to 1930, Beary taught at the United States Naval Academy. He then served on the staff of the Commander-in-Chief, United States Asiatic Fleet, from 1931 to 1934, seeing service on the Yangtze Patrol. From 1934 to 1935, he was assigned to duty with the Chief of Naval Operations in Washington, D.C. He then served on the staff of the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1936.Beary went back to sea in 1937 as executive officer of the battleship USS Colorado (BB-45), serving aboard her until 1938, when he was promoted to captain. He then was commanding officer of the light cruiser USS Richmond (CL-9) from 1938 to 1939 before returning to duty at the United States Naval Academy, serving a second tour as an instructor there from 1939 until 1941. On 1 October 1941, he became commanding officer of both the troop transport USS Mount Vernon (AP-22) and Transport Division 19. === World War II === Mount Vernon was in the Atlantic Ocean as part of a convoy steaming from Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, bound for Cape Town, South Africa, when the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, brought the United States into World War II on 7 December 1941. She proceeded via the Cape of Good Hope and the Indian Ocean to Singapore, arriving there on 13 January 1942. In port until 16 January 1942, she landed desperately needed reinforcements and evacuated refugees despite frequent Japanese air raids, herself coming under air attack. She then operated in the Indian Ocean and Southwest Pacific until March 1942 to move additional reinforcements from the Middle East to Southeast Asia and evacuate refugees from Australia. Beary received the Bronze Star Medal in 1943 for meritorious achievement in these operations, and was especially cited for his conspicuous professional ability, leadership, and organization during Mount Vernon\\'s stay in Singapore. In July 1942, Beary became Commandant of Naval Operations Base Iceland. On 10 February 1943 he was promoted to rear admiral and took command of the United States Atlantic Fleet\\'s Fleet Operational Training Command, which organized and trained ships\\' crews, upon its establishment on 14 March 1943. As its commanding officer, he oversaw the creation and operation of a number of navy training establishments along the United States East Coast, at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and on Culebra Island off Puerto Rico, including a number of Anti-Aircraft Training Centers; the Anti-Aircraft Training Afloat Program aboard the antiaircraft training ship USS Wyoming (AG-17); the Combat Information Center Group Training Center in Norfolk, Virginia; the Anti-Submarine Warfare Unit in Norfolk; the Fleet Sonar School in Key West, Florida, and the Minecraft Training Center at Little Creek, Virginia. In all, he directed the training of more than a million officers and men and supervised the shakedown or refresher training of about 5,000 ships and craft. He received the Distinguished Service Medal in February 1945 for this service.On 1 October 1944, Beary took command of Service Squadron 6, a revolutionary new mobile underway replenishment element of the Service Force, United States Pacific Fleet, dedicated to support of the U.S. Third and Fifth Fleets in the Pacific. He proved particularly gifted in maintaining logistic support to the fleet despite the vast distances involved in the Pacific Theater and the complex and demanding task of keeping the fleets\\' combat forces supplied while underway for their frequent operations, including during the Battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa. His achievements in Service Squadron 6 were recognized by two awards of the Legion of Merit, both in 1945, for exceptional and meritorious conduct. During the ceremony in which Japan surrendered to the Allies on board the battleship USS Missouri (BB-63) on 2 September 1945 to end World War II, Beary served as a dignitary on the staff of United States Army General of the Army Douglas MacArthur. === Post-World War II === After World War II, Beary held various commands, serving as administrator of the U.S. Naval Shipping Control Authority; commandant of the 12th Naval District in 1946; commander of Naval Base San Francisco; commander of Western Sea Frontier; and commander of Pacific Reserve Fleet.On 1 November 1948, having reached the rank of vice admiral, Beary returned to the Naval War College as its president. During his presidency, he sought to broaden the views of students by bringing business authorities and leaders to meet with them in roundtable discussions, laying the groundwork for the college\\'s Global Strategy Discussions of the 1950s and Current Strategy Forum of today.Beary remained the war college\\'s president until 28 May 1950. He retired from the navy on 1 October 1950. == Personal life == Beary was married to Alice L. Beary (1889-1953). They had one daughter, Alice B. Beary Meschter (1920-2006).Beary was a decorated marksman and a member of the Navy Gun Club. == Death == Beary died on 7 March 1966 at the U.S. Naval Hospital in San Diego, California. He was interred alongside his wife at the United States Naval Academy Cemetery and Columbarium with full military honors. == Namesake == The U.S. Navy destroyer escort (later frigate) USS Donald B.

              " 'The South Staffordshire Railway (SSR) was authorised in 1847 to build a line from Dudley in the West Midlands of England through Walsall and Lichfield to a junction with the Midland Railway on the way to Burton upon Trent, with authorised share capital of £945,000. It was supported by the newly-formed London and North Western Railway (LNWR) and the Midland Railway, giving each company access to important areas. It completed its main line in 1849. As collieries in the Cannock region rose in importance, it built a second main line from Walsall to Rugeley, as well as numerous short spurs and connections to lines it intersected. Colliery working in the Cannock area expanded enormously, and mineral traffic carryings increased in step. In 1850 the entire company\\'s operation was leased to a private individual, John Robinson McClean, the first time this was ever done. His lease was successful, but the London and North Western Railway wanted control of the network for its own strategic purposes, and it manoeuvred to get the SSR shareholders to transfer the lease to the LNWR; in 1867 the LNWR acquired ownership of the SSR. Short distance passenger operation in the Walsall area was always buoyant, but in the post-1945 period a decline set in, and industrial retrenchment resulted in a gradual loss of goods and mineral business too. In 1965 a major round of passenger service closures was imposed, although the cessation of services on the Hednesford and Rugeley section was reversed from 1989. This Walsall to Rugeley service and a very short section at Lichfield are the only remaining passenger operations on the former SSR system == Early railways in Birmingham == Birmingham and the surrounding area acquired the epithet The Workshop of the World, supporting a huge range of diverse manufacturing industries. As the requirements of industrial customers became more advanced, it became a feature of Birmingham industry was that one manufacturer would make the basic part of a product, and for that piece to be transferred to another manufacturer for finishing. This resulted in a very large number of increasingly specialised makers, dependent on efficient local goods transport, over a widening local area. The first railways in Birmingham had their terminals on the then eastern margin of the city, around the Curzon Street station of the Grand Junction Railway and the London and Birmingham Railway; the Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway had a terminus at Lawley Street, a little further out. In the earliest days this was acceptable; the hilly nature of the centre of Birmingham would have been difficult for early railways to approach, and interchange, particularly between the L&BR and the GJR, were simplified by their proximity. As railway traffic developed, and it became clearer what the dominant traffic flows were, the limitations of this configuration became important, and led to a number of proposed changes. The earliest railways generally limited themselves to connecting pairs or small groups of major centres, but soon the benefit of amalgamations became apparent, so that larger companies serving larger areas began to develop. This led to the formation of (among others) two large groups with significant presences in Birmingham: the Midland Railway, formed on 10 May 1844, with a network from Leeds to Derby and Nottingham, and on to Rugby, and by leases to Gloucester and Bristol in 1845; andthe London and North Western Railway on 16 July 1846, connecting London, Manchester and Liverpool.In August 1845, the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway (OW&WR) was obtaining authorisation to build its line. This was a competitive threat to the established railways, but serious financial problems delayed the progress of the OW&WR. Eventually it became aligned with the Great Western Railway (GWR), but that remained in the future for the time being.As well as these organisational changes, practical difficulties were becoming important in handling traffic that did not start or end its journey in Birmingham, and the Curzon Street stations became a difficult obstruction to such traffic. The formation of the LNWR eliminated a competitive tension that had existed (between the London and Birmingham Railway and the Grand Junction Railway); at the same time the LNWR and the Midland Railway did not see themselves as direct competitors, so that a collaborative approach now seemed possible. == The core network == === Authorisation: Dudley, Walsall and northwards === Walsall and Dudley were important manufacturing towns, and it was to be expected that a railway connection between them would be put forward. The South Staffordshire Junction Railway was proposed to connect the two towns, with junction connections to the Grand Junction Railway, now to be part of the LNWR. The SSJR got its authorising Act of Parliament on 3 August 1846, with permitted share capital of £525,000. At the same time, another company, the Trent Valley, Midlands and Grand Junction Railway was authorised. It was to make a line from Walsall northwards through Lichfield to join the Midland Railway main line (heading towards Burton-on-Trent) at Wichnor. It too was authorised on 3 August 1846, with capital of £420,000. The two companies had been in discussion and saw there were advantages in combining, and this was allowed for in their respective Acts. Final agreement for this was accomplished on 6 October, ratified by an Act of 9 July 1847. The 1847 Act also confirmed a change of name for the combined company, which was to be called the South Staffordshire Railway; the combined share capital was fixed at £945,000; in addition the Act granted running powers over the Midland Railway from Wichnor Junction to Burton. === First construction: Walsall to Bescot === Although the Act of Parliament authorised the share capital, the Company had to obtain the share subscriptions, as well as acquire the necessary land. The Board decided on a modest start to construction, by building from Walsall to Bescot on the former Grand Junction Railway route. This was quickly accomplished, and the line was opened on 1 November 1847; temporary station premises were used at Walsall, south of Bridgeman Place, and the line connected to a junction on the GJR main line, called Bescot Junction. It is probable that the first trains were operated by the LNWR using their own rolling stock. There was no station at the junction. Prior to the opening of the Walsall line, there had been a station further north-west on the GJR line called \"Walsall\". It was now renamed Bescot Bridge, and it was used for journeys from Wolverhampton and further north to Walsall, by changing there to road transport. === Walsall to Wichnor === Of the main line sections originally authorised, there now remained the connection from Walsall to Wichnor Junction, joining the northward Midland Railway main line on the way to Burton: the length of this section was 17 miles. A construction contract was allocated on 17 May 1847. The work proceeded well enough, and on 1 March 1849 Captain Wynne of the Board of Trade inspected the line for passenger working. While much of the line was satisfactory, the junction connecting to the Midland Railway at Wichnor had not been installed. Wynne approved the line for passenger operation between Walsall and Lichfield, a distance of 10+1⁄2 miles. The company did not open that section at once, but waited until the remainder of the Wichnor route was ready. Wynne inspected the remainder of the line on 4 April 1849 and approved it, and it opened on 9 April 1849.However Boynton says: The date is often given as 9th April, but all that happened then was the running of a special for Directors, followed by a celebratory lunch at the George Hotel, Lichfield, attended by the mayor of the city and the High Sheriff of Staffordshire. Passenger services for ordinary mortals had to wait until 1st June. That day saw the opening 0f a permanent station at Walsall, on the present site... A South Staffs station at Lichfield Trent Valley opened in August, eleven months after one on the main Trent Valley line below. The Midland had running rights to Walsall and the LNWR had running rights through Wichnor Junction to Burton and Derby, capital of the Midland system. The temporary Walsall station was closed and the new permanent station, described by a newspaper as \"splendid\" was put into use. == South to Dudley == Now the Company extended its line southwards to Dudley, from a new junction off the Walsall to Bescot line, a distance of five miles. However the section of line presented to the Board of Trade inspecting officer for approval for passenger operation was not approved. Goods traffic (not needing that approval) started on 1 March 1850. On 1 May 1850 the line to Dudley was fully opened, the deficiencies having been rectified. This opening included an east-to-south spur enabling direct running from Bescot Junction to Dudley.The first Dudley station was a terminus north-east of Tipton Road; for a time the SSR Was the only railway with a presence in Dudley. In 1852 the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway opened its line as far as Dudley, and the South Staffordshire Railway opened a new station adjacent to the OW&WR station, but not connected to it. The OW&WR continued northwards the following year. The configuration of the two stations was still unsatisfactory, and an improved station connected to the OW&WR line platforms was opened in 1859. == Branches and spur connections == The core main line network of the SSR was thus completed. For some time it had been obvious that the original pattern of the earlier main lines was imperfect, and steps were taken to improve matters. In addition the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway was building its line, and the Great Western Railway too was taking steps to make a presence locally. The OW&WR and the GWR were later to align with one another under the GWR name, but for the time being they were far from friendly to one another. Moreover there was a rapid development in manufacturing industry in the area. There was a huge demand for transport of raw materials in and completed goods out, and factories were established in newly developed locations . Interconnection between railways of diverse ownership was essential in this environment, and the SSR\\'s position cutting across the grain of many main lines resulted in the construction of a number of junctions and spurs to enable transfer traffic. === Stour Valley line at Sedgeley === The Birmingham, Wolverhampton and Stour Valley Railway was opened in 1852. Usually referred to as the Stour Valley Line, it was an affiliate of the LNWR providing a more satisfactory route between Birmingham and Wolverhampton for that company. A new central station was being constructed in Birmingham, and as New Street station it opened fully in 1854. The Stour Valley line crossed over the Dudley to Walsall line of the South Staffordshire Railway at Dudley Port. The SSR Act of 1851 had authorised a short connecting line to the Stour Valley line with running powers into the LNWR High Level station, and gave the LNWR reciprocal running powers from there to Dudley. The connecting line was known as the Sedgeley Loop and it ran to a position alongside the new Stour Valley station and beyond it to form a junction with it. There was already a Low Level station at Dudley Port on the SSR main line, but the intention was to have a High Level station alongside the new Stour Valley station. However space at that point was extremely limited, as the Loop line was sandwiched between the Stour Valley line and the canal. Although the Sedgeley Loop and the connection to the Stour Valley line beyond were double track, the SSR station was built as a single line. The Board of Trade inspecting officer, Captain Galton, declined to allow opening of the section of line east of the station. The loop itself to the new SSR High Level station were acceptable, but the continuing through connection was not, apparently because of the perceived danger of working passenger trains from both east and west into the single line station. Use of the loop for trains terminating at Dudley Port started on 14 October 1853, but it was not until a connection was provided at the west end of the Stour Valley station, enabling the use of the BW&SVR platforms by through trains, that through running was permitted. This started on 2 January 1854, with a through passenger service between Dudley and Birmingham.In 1852 construction of the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway reached Dudley, and was continued to Tipton in 1853. The OW&WR was merged with other railways to form the West Midland Railway (WMR) in 1860 and in turn the WMR was absorbed into the Great Western Railway by Act of 1 August 1863.The opening of these portions of the OW&WR enabled through working by SSR trains from Kidderminster to Birmingham via the Sedgeley loop, but this service was operationally difficult and it was discontinued south of Dudley in 1867, with only two through New Street to Dudley services each way on weekdays. The connecting service for the short run from Dudley to Dudley Port prospered; it and the Walsall trains together were nicknamed \"The Dudley Dasher\". The Sedgeley loop service was eventually discontinued on 15 June 1964. === Birmingham, Wolverhampton and Dudley Railway === In 1846 another line between Birmingham and Wolverhampton had been authorised, on the same day as the original South Staffordshire Junction Railway: it was the Birmingham, Wolverhampton and Dudley Railway. It was nominally independent but very obviously aligned towards the Great Western Railway, which was to build towards Birmingham through the medium of another nominally independent company, the Birmingham and Oxford Junction Railway. The \"Dudley\" part of the BW&DR name represented a branch line that very closely duplicated most of the SSJR route. Although this had been authorised, the BW&DR agreed to leave the SSR (as it soon became) to build it, with running powers for BW&DR trains. There was a safeguard for the BW&DR if the SSR failed to build the line promptly. The BW&DR obtained an authorising Act in 1847 to sell its line to the Great Western Railway, and remarkably the Act authorised installation of mixed gauge (standard and broad gauge) track on the BW&DR. When the line opened in 1854 local passenger trains operated on the broad gauge. The SSR intersected and was crossed by the BW&DR at Wednesbury and a north-east to north-west connection was installed on 1 June, 1859, connecting the SSR to the BWDR route to Wolverhampton. It was laid with mixed gauge track, but the broad gauge rails were removed on 1 April 1869. The SSR had running powers over the BW&DR to Wolverhampton, although it is believed they were never exercised. === Wednesbury to Darlaston branch === An SSR Act of 23 July 1855 gave authorisation to build from Wednesbury SSR to Darlaston on the old GJR route. A single line opened on 14 September 1863 from the Darlaston former GJR station to Wednesbury. The Darlaston station was renamed James Bridge and a platform was provided on the Darlaston branch. The line was doubled on 22 December 1872. At first there was an intensive passenger service, of 56 daily trains; but the introduction of street-running trams practically wiped out the business and the passenger service was discontinued in 1887. The line was closed north of the Lloyds Works Siding at Fallings Heath on 24 December 1963; most of the rest of the line (except for a siding at the southern extremity) closed at the beginning of 1968. === Wednesbury – Princes End – Tipton branch === The 1855 Act also authorised a branch from Wednesbury to a triangular junction with the Stour Valley line at Tipton, penetrating a heavily industrialised area around Princes End. There was some delay in completing it, but it was opened on 14 September 1863. The south curve at Tipton to Tipton Station Junction was opened on 1 January 1883, and was not used for passenger traffic, except much later for diversionary purposes. A Walsall to Wolverhampton passenger service operated (to the northward curve) and its fate varied greatly, as there were better routes available for such a connection. The passenger services were withdrawn in 1916 as a wartime measure, and the line closed completely on 6 April 1981. === Leighs Wood colliery branch === A two-mile branch line was authorised in 1878, earlier (1855) powers having lapsed; it ran eastward from the SSR line near Pelsall to Leighs Wood colliery. The line opened on 14 November 1878, serving only a colliery and a brickworks; it closed in August 1965. === New Pleck curve === A west to north curve was provided at Pleck, connecting the old GJR route from Bushbury to the SSR route towards Walsall. It was authorised on 28 June 1877 and opened on 1 March 1881. On the same day the Portobello curve opened, connecting the GJR route into Wolverhampton LNWR station directly from the south-east for the first time. This enabled a Walsall to Wolverhampton passenger service. It was discontinued from 1964 but reinstated from 2000 with an hourly dmu service, but closed to passengers once again from 2008. == Control of the company == === Leasing the company === In 1849 with the main line only just completed, John Robinson McClean, the engineer to the SSR company, together with supporting business people, approached the SSR with an offer to lease the railway. The LNWR and MR were substantial shareholders and were opposed to the arrangement, fearing that the line would ally itself with competitors, but the majority of the shareholders considered that the offer was advantageous to them, and the idea was approved. The necessary powers were included in the SSR Leasing Act of 1850 The issued capital of the SSR was calculated as £669,375 and the rent charge was to be 2% of this in the first year, amounting to £13,387 10s., doubling after the first year and increasing to 5% after 14 years. The lease between McClean and the company became effective from 1 July 1850. No individual had ever been authorised by Parliament to lease a railway before, so this was a considerable precedent. After an initial period, McClean contracted train operation to the LNWR in 1852. === Relations with the Midland Railway === In 1853 James Allport became General Manager of the Midland Railway, and from that time relations between that company and the SSR became strained. Through running at Wichnor Junction was discontinued at Allport\\'s insistence, and exchange sidings had to be built there for handing over goods wagons. A \"Wichnor\" passenger station also had to be built, just inside SSR territory, for the exchange of engines on through passenger trains. SSR passengers heading for Derby had to change at Burton. Whatever Allport\\'s objective was, this pushed the SSR closer to the LNWR. === LNWR control === Towards the end of the 1850s the LNWR interests worked hard to make McClean\\'s lease unworkable; the LNWR clearly wanted to acquire the line. In 1858 McClean and the company agreed to discontinue the lease arrangement, and this was formally agreed on 21 January 1858. Negotiations to agree the financial implications of the disengagement were extremely protracted, and McClean\\'s lease terminated on 1 February 1860. He was compensated for the loss of profit for the residue of his lease; the sum was £110,099, which Boynton says, \"made an already wealthy man stupendously rich\".From that date the LNWR took over the lease. The Midland Railway had been a significant influence within the company from the outset, but now their involvement diminished. The LNWR lease was anticipated to be for 99 years. However, in common with many other railway leases, the advantages of outright control were compelling. Moreover the LNWR feared that the Midland Railway might get control of the line, establishing a significant presence in LNWR territory. The lease continued for a time, but arrangements were made to transfer the SSR company to LNWR ownership. The transfer was ratified by the LNWR (New Works and Additional Powers) Act of 15 July 1867.The SSR network was now part of the LNWR, although there were running powers protections retained for the Midland Railway. This was a double edged sword, for it gave the LNWR, as owner of the SSR network, running powers over the Midland Railway into Burton. This was an attractive benefit, of which the LNWR intended to take full advantage.The LNWR sent a goods train to exercise the running powers to Derby via Wichnor Junction. The train found the line blocked at the junction. Neele wrote, Arriving at Wichnor Junction I was surprised to see a large number of platelayers, about, two or three engines in steam, and a saloon carriage in the siding. One of the engines with steam up had attached to its tender the V crossing of the junction over which we had to pass to get to Burton... Mr Needham [the superintendent of the Midland], who had bivouacked all night in the saloon, refused to allow the LNW train to pass. On asking Mr Needham for what purpose the force of Midland men was requisitioned, he told me that it was reported that the London and North Western were coming down with a body of 300 men and three engines intending to force their way into Burton, and that it had been determined to resist. Instructions came to me by telegraph: once more at the appointed time in the afternoon, a passage must be claimed. Some wiser counsels had prevailed at Derby, for when the time came, the opposing force had disappeared, and we made a triumphal journey towards Burton. == Cannock lines == === Reaching Cannock === In the SSR Act of 1847 there were powers to build from Walsall to Cannock, which was becoming an important centre of extractive industry. The SSR did not progress this work at the time, but got an extension of time in 1854. In addition a three mile branch line was now authorised from near Pelsall on the SSR Lichfield line, to Norton Canes. Although the engineering of the line was relatively simple, there was a problem over the lack of a turntable at the Cannock terminus that resulted in a delay to the opening of the line, until 31 January 1858. The Norton Canes branch opened on the same day. === Cannock Mineral Railway === A prospective railway company called the Derbyshire, Staffordshire and Worcestershire Junction Railway had tried to get Parliamentary authority to build from Uttoxeter to Dudley, connecting Manchester in to its network as well by means of running powers. It had been rebuffed, but in the 1847 session a more modest scheme was authorised, from the North Staffordshire Railway at Uttoxeter to Cannock, making an end-on connection with the (proposed) SSR line there. Several years passed without much progress, largely due to failure to generate share subscriptions, and attempts to bring one of the large railway companies on board as a financial sponsor were also fruitless. A further reduction in scope was necessary, and the title of the Cannock Mineral Railway (CMR) was adopted. Further prevarication followed until in June 1857 the LNWR appeared as guarantor. The line was finally built, between Cannock and Rugeley only, opening on 2 November 1859; it was worked by the LNWR. === Norton branch === A colliery line was opened on 1 February 1858 from Norton Junction to Norton Crossing Junction, a distance of 2+3⁄4 miles. === Cannock Chase Railway === The Cannock Chase Railway was authorised in 1860 to provide a link between the Cannock Mineral Railway and the Marquis of Anglesey\\'s colliery interests. It ran east from Hednesford to Rawnsley, with a spur to Heathy Leasows to connect with the Littleworth Tramway. The Cannock Chase Railway was opened on 7 October 1862, and was worked by the collieries themselves. === Norton branch extension railway === A continuation of the Norton branch from Norton Crossing Junction opened on 25 April 1879. The line continued to East Cannock Junction on the Walsall to Rugeley line, forming a through route. == Grouping and nationalisation, and afterwards == In 1923 the London and North Western Railway was incorporated within the new London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), as part of a process known as the \"Grouping\" of the railways, following the Railways Act 1921. By this time the distinct character of the former South Staffordshire Railway was waning. In 1948 the railways were once again reorganised, following the Transport Act, 1947, which resulted in the LMS being taken into national ownership as part of British Railways. Following the end of World War II there was a steep decline in the use of local passenger trains, and of wagonload goods services, and British Railways accumulated huge losses. While some small-scale closures had taken place in the 1950s, by the following decade it was plain that the situation needed to be managed. === Passenger service withdrawals === There was a nationwide wave of withdrawal of unremunerative passenger services during the 1960s. The former Western Region (ex-GWR) services from Birmingham Snow Hill to Dudley were withdrawn on 15 June 1964, and the Walsall to Dudley line closed to passengers on 6 July 1964; Dudley station was therefore closed. The following year a large-scale passenger closure took place on 18 January 1965: from Walsall to Wichnor Junction via Lichfield; from Walsall to Water Orton via Sutton Park; from Walsall to Wolverhampton via Pleck; and Walsall to Rugeley. This left passenger operation on only the short section from Walsall to Bescot Junction, and a short length at Lichfield. === Electrification === In the mid 1960s an extensive electrification programme was undertaken involving main line routes through Birmingham and elsewhere. As part of the work, the short section from Bescot to Walsall was electrified, from 15 August 1966.The Hednesford and Cannock line was not opened to passenger trains until later, but in 2014 it was announced that the line between Walsall and Rugeley was to be electrified, with a completion date of 2017.Lichfield City and the short link on the former SSR route to Lichfield Trent Valley were served by the Cross-City line passenger services from 1978 and 1988 respectively. On 6 June 1993 the Cross-City services, and this short former SSR section, were electrified. === Rugeley passenger services === Passing through an area which after World War II was subject to industrial decline, usage of the passenger trains on the Cannock and Rugeley line declined steeply, and the passenger service had been discontinued from 18 January 1965. All the intermediate stations between Walsall and Rugeley Trent Valley were closed to passengers. The Walsall Area Passenger Group made strenuous efforts during 1974 to get the line reopened to passengers. A reconstructed and modernised station was opened at Walsall in 1980, giving impetus to the idea. The group were successful, and passenger services were reinstated between Walsall and Hednesford on 10 April 1989. The line north of Hednesford had been reclassified operationally as a goods line, and re-equipping it for passenger operation was stated to be excessively costly. However in November 1993 it was announced that the line would be reopened to passengers, but then the necessary work was greatly delayed and the services did not begin until March 1997. There were 13 trains each way daily. === Dudley Freightliner Terminal === As passenger use ceased, it was considered that Dudley station would be a good location for a freightliner terminal, particularly as the rail connectivity was good. It was opened on 6 November 1967. However the facility lasted only 21 years and was closed on 17 April 1988. === Cannock mineral traffic === Although coalmining in the Cannock area had declined substantially in the post-war period, there were still several operational collieries in 1965. These declined, but changing activity by the coal and electricity generating industries resulted in novel traffic flows. Nevertheless in the late 1970s substantial closure had taken place, and even a new opencast location at Essington Wood closed in 1992. Rugeley \\'B\\' power station opened in 1970. == Incidents == On 22 December 1859 one passenger jumped from a Walsall to Birmingham train near Perry Barr railway station and was killed, and others were injured, due to the train, using South Staffordshire Railway rolling stock, being derailed by one of its carriages shedding a tyre. == The present day == At present (2022) heavy rail passenger operation takes place from Bescot (now named Bescot Stadium) to Walsall; and on to Rugeley; and from Lichfield City Station to Lichfield Trent Valley. The line from Lichfield Trent Valley to Wichnor Junction has (2022) only one regular passenger service, the 08:11 Leeds to Plymouth, but it is used from time to time by trains between Burton and Birmingham when engineering works or other causes make the route through Kingsbury unavailable. == Locations == === Dudley – Walsall – Wichnor route === Dudley; temporary station, opened 4 May 1850; extended to permanent station after a few months; closed 6 July 1964; Sedgeley Junction; divergence to Dudley Port High Level; Dudley Port; opened 1 May 1850; closed 6 July 1964; Great Bridge North; opened 1 May 1850; renamed Great Bridge North 1 July 1950; closed 6 July 1964; Wednesbury; opened 1 May 1850; renamed Wednesbury Town 13 June 1960; closed 6 July 1964; Bescot Curve Junction; divergence to Aston; Pleck Junction; convergence from Aston; Walsall; temporary station opened 1 November 1847; replaced by permanent station 9 April 1849; still open; Ryecroft Junction; divergence to Cannock linel Rushall; opened 24 March 1856; closed 1 March 1909; Pelsall; opened 9 April 1849; closed 18 January 1965; Brownhills; opened 9 April 1849; renamed Brownhills High Street 2 June 1924; renamed Brownhills 1 August 1930; closed 18 January 1965; Hammerwich; opened June 1849 ;closed 18 January 1965; Lichfield City; opened 9 April 1849; renamed Lichfield City 1871; relocated 3 November 1884; still open; Lichfield Trent Valley Junction; 9 April 1849; replaced by Lichfield Trent Valley High Level 3 July 1871; closed 18 January 1965; reopened 28 November 1988; still open; Brookhay; opened 9 April 1849; closed December 1849; Alrewas; opened 9 April 1849; closed 18 January 1965; Wichnor Junction (station); opened 2 April 1855; closed 1 November 1877; Wichnor Junction; convergence with Midland Railway main line. === Cannock and Rugeley route === Walsall; above; Ryecroft Junction; above; Birchills; opened February 1858; closed 1 January 1916; Bloxwich; opened 1 February 1858; closed 18 January 1965; reopened 17 April 1989; still open; Bloxwich North; opened 2 October 1990; still open; Landywood; opened 2 March 1908; closed 1 January 1916; Wyrley and Church Bridge; opened 1 February 1858; renamed Wyrley and Cheslyn Hay 1 December 1912; closed 18 January 1965; Cannock; opened 1 February 1858; closed 18 January 1965; reopened 10 April 1989; still open; Hednesford; opened 7 November 1859; closed 18 January 1965; reopened 10 April 1989; still open; Brindley Heath; opened 3 August 1939 and 17 August 1939 for RAF families; fully open 26 August 1939; closed 6 April 1959; Rugeley Town; opened 1 June 1870; closed 18 January 1965; reopened 2 June 1997; still open; Rugeley Trent Valley; opened 15 September 1847; still open. == Notes == == References ==',\n",

              " 'Józef Kępiński ([juzɛf kɛ̃piɲski]; 12 September 1900 – 26 March 1964) was a Polish aviator and officer of the Polish Air Force and the Royal Air Force during World War II. Among other posts he was a commanding officer of the 111th Fighter Escadrille in Poland and the I/145 Polish Fighter Squadron in France, as well as the Air Training Centre. == Before World War II == He was born in Stryków near Łódź. Józef Kępiński joined the renascent Polish Army on 1 November 1918. Together with the 1st Chevau-léger Regiment he took part in the Polish-Ukrainian War. Withdrawn from the front for training he returned to front-line service with the rank of podporucznik, in time to take part in the Polish-Bolshevist War of 1920. After the armistice and the Peace of Riga he remained in the army and in 1926 he volunteered for the Polish Air Force. He trained as a fighter pilot in various escadrilles and eventually joined the 121 Fighter Escadrille (later renamed the 111th) flying Spad 61 fighters.An excellent and decorated pilot, in 1932 he became the commanding officer of his escadrille and the following year was promoted to the rank of captain. In 1936 he became the commanding officer of the IV Fighter Squadron (comprising 113th and 114th Fighter Escadrilles). Promoted to the rank of major, in 1937 Kępiński was dispatched to Dęblin, where he headed the Air Training Centre (Polish: Centrum Wyszkolenia Lotnictwa), the predecessor to Polish Air Force Academy. == World War II == After the start of the Invasion of Poland he headed an ad-hoc air defence of Dęblin. Ordered to evacuate from Poland after the Soviet invasion, he fled to Romania. Interned, he managed to escape and reach France, where he joined the Polish Air Forces in France and Great Britain. Dispatched to Lyon-Bron, he became the first commanding officer of the I/145 Polish Fighter Squadron.During the Battle of France, despite flying the obsolete Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 and Caudron C.714 fighters, the Polish unit under Kępiński\\'s command achieved 11 victories in the first three days of the Battle of France. However, on 10 June 1940 Kępiński led his unit against a German bombing raid south of Dreux, covered by approximately 12 Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters. Blinded by the sun, Kępiński became separated from his unit and mistook the enemy formation for his own. Heavily wounded, with his lung shot through, he managed to crash-land his damaged airplane at Dreux airfield. He spent the remainder of the campaign in hospitals in Chartres and Vichy. In October 1940, he escaped from Vichy France, passing through Spain and Portugal to reach Great Britain. Unable to serve as a fighter pilot due to his earlier wounds, he served on various rear-area posts for the rest of World War II flying Percival Proctor, Miles Master and Airspeed Oxford planes. He eventually rose to the Polish rank of lieutenant colonel (podpułkownik) and the British rank of group captain. == After World War II == After the war he returned to Communist-held Poland and continued his military service. Forced to retire in 1949, during the Stalinist repressions against pre-war Polish officers, he was placed on a proscription list and spent the remainder of his life doing menial jobs and working as an ordinary worker in Warsaw. He died 26 March 1964 in Warsaw and was buried at the Powązki Military Cemetery. == References == === Citations === === Bibliography === Wojciech Zmyślony (2009). \"Józef Kępiński\".

              " 'Information cards are personal digital identities that people can use online, and the key component of an identity metasystem. Visually, each i-card has a card-shaped picture and a card name associated with it that enable people to organize their digital identities and to easily select one they want to use for any given interaction. The information card metaphor is implemented by identity selectors like Windows CardSpace, DigitalMe or Higgins Identity Selector. An identity metasystem is an interoperable architecture for digital identity that enables people to have and employ a collection of digital identities based on multiple underlying technologies, implementations, and providers. Using this approach, customers can continue to use their existing identity infrastructure investments, choose the identity technology that works best for them, and more easily migrate from old technologies to new technologies without sacrificing interoperability with others. The identity metasystem is based upon the principles in \"The Laws of Identity\". == Overview == There are three participants in digital identity interactions using information cards: Identity providers issue digital identities for you. For example, businesses might issue identities to their customers, governments might vouch for the identities of their citizens, credit card issuers might provide identities enabling payment, online services could provide verified data such as age, and individuals might use self-issued identities to log onto websites. Relying parties (RPs) accept identities for you. Online services that you use can accept digital identities that you choose and use the information provided by them on your behalf, with your consent. Subject is yourself, the party in control of all these interactions. The subject can choose which of its applicable digital identities to use with the relying party. === Selectors === An identity selector is used to store, manage, and use their digital identities. Examples of identity selectors are Microsoft\\'s Windows CardSpace, the Bandit Project\\'s DigitalMe, and several kinds of Identity Selectors from the Eclipse Foundation\\'s Higgins project. An identity selector performs the following user-centric identity management tasks: Provides a consistent user experience for authentication (and in some cases other kinds of interactions) with an RP (also known as a Service Provider). Provides a user interface that displays a set of information card icons from which the user selects their preferred i-card when authentication is required by a local application or relying party (e.g. a website\\'s login page). Provides a user interface to create and manage personal (also known as self-issued) information cards. Provides a local security token service that is used to issue the security tokens for personal i-cards. Provides a user interface to import and export information cards in standard file formats. Is invoked by a browser extension or by a local rich client application.An identity selector may also allow the user to manage (e.g. create, review, update, and delete cards within) their portfolio of i-cards. === Identity metasystems === There are five key components to an identity metasystem: A way to represent identities using claims. Claims are carried in security tokens, as per WS-Security. A means for identity providers, relying parties, and subjects to negotiate. Dynamically negotiating the claims to be delivered and the security token format used enables the identity metasystem to carry any format of token and any kinds of claims needed for a digital identity interaction. Negotiation occurs using WS-SecurityPolicy statements exchanged using WS-MetadataExchange. An encapsulating protocol to obtain claims and requirements. The WS-Trust and WS-Federation protocols are used to carry requests for security tokens and responses containing those tokens. A means to bridge technology and organizational boundaries using claims transformation. Security token services (STS) as defined in WS-Trust are used to transform claim contents and formats. A consistent user experience across multiple contexts, technologies, and operators. This is achieved via identity selector client software such as Windows CardSpace representing digital identities owned by users as visual i-cards. === Generic qualities === I-cards are created by an entity known as a issuer. I-cards display the name of the issuer (issuerName) in a text string. I-cards have a text string to identify the card (cardName) that is initially set by the card issuer. Typically this card name is user-editable. I-cards may have a (GIF or JPEG) background image (cardImage) set by the card issuer (user-editable). In most i-cards the user is able to see the value of the claims. == Sign-in capabilities == Using i-cards, users can authenticate without needing a username and password for every website; instead, at sites accepting them, they can log in with an i-card, which may be used at multiple sites. Each information card utilizes a distinct pair-wise digital key for every realm where a key is requested. A realm may be a single site or a set of related sites all sharing the same target scope information when requesting an information card. The use of distinct pair-wise keys per realm means that even if a person is tricked into logging into an imposter site with an i-card, a different key would be used at that site than the site that the imposter was trying to impersonate; no shared secret is released. Furthermore, many identity selectors provide a means of phishing detection, where the HTTPS certificate of the relying party site is checked and compared against a list of the sites at which the user has previously used an information card. When a new site is visited, the user is informed that they have not previously used a card there. == Types of i-cards == The Identity Selector Interoperability Profile v 1.5 (or OASIS IMI v1.0 Committee Draft) specifies two types of information cards that an identity selector must support. Personal Information Cards: (Also called self-issued) these cards allow you to issue claims about yourself to sites willing to accept them. These claims can include your name, address, phone numbers, e-mail address, web address, birth date, gender, and a site-specific key uniquely generated for each site where the card is used. Managed Information Cards: These cards allow identity providers other than yourself to make claims about you to sites willing to accept them. These claims can include any information that an RP requests, an identity provider is able to provide, and you are willing to send between them.The Higgins project is defining two new kinds of i-cards as well: Relationship cards (or R-cards) are used to establish an ongoing relationship between multiple parties. Zero-knowledge cards (or Z-cards)However the Information Card format allows for custom types; The Bandit project demonstrated prototype managed cards backed by OpenIDs at the Novell BrainShare conference in March 2007. === Personal cards === The first kind of personal Information cards were also introduced as part of Microsoft’s Windows CardSpace software in November 2006. Their behavior is also defined by the same documents covering the Microsoft-defined managed cards (see above). Summary of characteristics: Data format an XML file containing: set of claim type URIs as well as the (user-defined) values of these claims, cardImage, a unique cardID, etc. This data format is defined in the ISIP documents. Issuer: The user\\'s own Identity Selector. Personal cards can be described as self-issued Genesis: Created by the user\\'s Identity Selector. Claims: 15 pre-defined claim types (e.g. firstname, surname, email address, etc.) are defined in the Identity Selector Interoperability Profile v 1.5 (or OASIS IMI v1.0 Committee Draft). Authority: The user\\'s Identity Selector is the authority for the issued token\\'s set of claim values. Data flow: On demand (e.g. as needed by a relying site), an STS local to the Identity Selector creates a security token with the current values. Editability: The claim values are directly editable by the user. Attribute data source: The personal card XML file contains claim values. When imported into an Identity Selector these data values are then managed internally by the selector. === Managed information cards === The first kind of managed card was introduced as part of Microsoft’s Windows CardSpace software in November 2006. The behavior, file format and interoperability characteristics of these kinds of managed cards are defined by Microsoft documents such as the Identity Selector Interoperability Profile v 1.5 (or OASIS IMI v1.0 Committee Draft; see self-issued.info for a more complete list), in combination with open standards including WS-Trust and others. Summary of characteristics: Data format: an XML file containing: network endpoint of the STS, set of claim type URIs, name of the card, cardImage, issuerName, a unique cardID, etc. The XML file format is defined in the ISIP documents. Issuer: An external, third party token service (representing an external person or organization). Genesis: A managed card is generated by a Security Token Service running at an Identity Provider site and imported into the user\\'s Identity Selector. Claims: The list of supported claim types (claim type URIs) is defined by the issuer. Authority: The issuer is the sole authority for the claim values contained within the token it issues. Data flow: Managed cards contain a network endpoint reference to an STS that, when requested by the Identity Selector (using WS-Trust, etc.) generates/provides a security token containing the required claims. Editability: Underlying attribute data is not directly editable by the user. Attribute data source: Determined by the issuer, and generally managed by the issuer.I-cards issued by third parties can employ any of four methods for the user to authenticate himself as the card owner: a Personal Information Card (self-issued), an X.509 certificate (which can either be from a hardware device such as a SmartCard or it can be a software certificate), a Kerberos ticket, such as those issued by many enterprise login solutions, or a username and password for the card.Additional methods could also be implemented by future identity selectors and identity providers. Managed i-cards can be auditing, non-auditing, or auditing-optional: Auditing cards require the identity of the RP site to be disclosed to the Identity Provider. This can be used to restrict which sites the identity provider is willing to release information to. Non-auditing cards will not disclose the identity of the RP site to the Identity Provider. Auditing-optional cards will disclose the identity of the Relying Party site if provided by the RP, but do not require this disclosure. === Relationship cards === Relationship cards are under development by the Higgins project (see the report by Paul Trevithick).Summary of characteristics: Data format: A managed card that supports a resource-udi claim. Supported Claims: Like all managed (or personal) cards, r-cards include a list of supported claim types (expressed as URIs) as defined by the issuer. This set defines the maximal set of claims that issuer will include in its generated security token. These claims are inherited from underlying ISIP-m-card upon which it is based and are used for the same purposes. Beyond managed cards the resource-udi \"meta\" claim provides a reference to a set of attributes. Authority: The issuer is the authority for the issued token\\'s set of claim values (as per a normal managed or personal card). Editability: The values of underlying attributes (referenced by the resource-udi claim) may be editable by parties other than the issuer. Supported Attributes: The value of an r-card\\'s resource-udi claim is an Entity UDI (URI) that \"points to\" a data entity (representing a person, organization, or other object). The set of attributes of this data entity is distinct from (though usually a superset of) the \"supported claims\" mentioned above. ==== Reliance on the Higgins Data Model ==== Conceptually a managed card is essentially a human-friendly \"pointer\" to a Token Service—a web service (e.g. a STS) from which security tokens can be requested. A security token is a set of attribute assertions (aka claims) about some party that is cryptographically signed by the issuer (the token service acting as the authority). An r-card, contains a second \"pointer\" that points to a data entity whose attribute\\'s values (i) shared by all parties to the r-card and (ii) form the underlying attributes that are consumed by the r-card issuer\\'s STS and provide the values of the claims that this STS makes. By including this second \"pointer\" on the r-card, r-card holders have the potential to access and update some subset of these underlying attributes. The card issuer maintains an access control policy to control who has what level of access. This second pointer is an Entity UDI—a reference to an Entity object in the Higgins Context Data Model. Entity UDIs may be dereferenced and the underlying Entity\\'s attributes accessed by using the Higgins project\\'s Identity Attribute Service. Once resolved, consumers of this service can inspect, and potentially modify the attributes of the entity as well as get its schema as described in Web Ontology Language (OWL). In addition to basic identity attribute values like strings and numbers, the data entity referred to by an r-card can have complex attribute values consisting of aggregates of basic attribute types as well as UDI links to other entities. == Claims == Beyond being used to log into sites, Information Cards can also facilitate other kinds of interactions. The Information Card model provides great flexibility because cards can be used to convey any information from an Identity Provider to a Relying Party that makes sense to both of them and that the person is willing to release. The data elements carried in i-cards are called Claims. One possible use of claims is online age verification, with Identity Providers providing proof-of-age cards, and RPs accepting them for purposes such as online wine sales; other attributes could be verified as well. Another is online payment, where merchants could accept online payment cards from payment issuers, containing only the minimal information needed to facilitate payment. Role statements carried by claims can be used for access control decisions by Relying Parties. == Interoperability and licensing == The protocols needed to build Identity Metasystem components can be used by anyone for any purpose with no licensing cost and interoperable implementations can be built using only publicly available documentation. Patent promises have been issued by Microsoft, IBM, and others ensuring that the protocols underlying the Identity Metasystem can be freely used by all. The Information Cards defined by the Identity Selector Interoperability Profile v 1.5 (or OASIS IMI v1.0 Committee Draft) are based on open, interoperable communication standards. Interoperable i-card components have been built by dozens of companies and projects for platforms including Windows, Mac OS, and Linux, plus a prototype implementation for phones. Together, these components implement an interoperable Identity Metasystem. Information Cards can be used to provide identities both for Web sites and Web Services applications. Several interoperability testing events for i-cards have been sponsored by OSIS and the Burton Group, one was at the Interop at the October 2007 European Catalyst Conference in Barcelona and the most recent was at RSA 2008. These events are helping to ensure that the different Information Card software components being built by the numerous participants in the Identity Metasystem work well together. The protocols needed to build Information Card implementations based on the Identity Selector Interoperability Profile v 1.5 (or OASIS IMI v1.0 Committee Draft) can be used by anyone for any purpose at no cost and interoperable implementations can be built using only publicly available documentation. Patent promises have been issued by Microsoft, IBM, and others, ensuring that this Information Card technology is freely available to all. In June 2008, industry leaders including Equifax, Google, Microsoft, Novell, Oracle, PayPal and others created the Information Card Foundation in order to advance the use of the Information Card metaphor as a key component of an open, interoperable, royalty-free, user-centric identity layer spanning both the enterprise and the Internet. In his report on the Interop at the June 2007 Catalyst Conference in San Francisco, analyst Bob Blakley wrote: The interop event was a milestone in the maturation of user-centric identity technology. Prior to the event, there were some specifications, one commercial product, and a number of open-source projects. After the event, it can accurately be said that there is a running Identity Metasystem. == History of the terminology == The term \"information card\" was introduced by Microsoft in May 2005 as a name for the visual information card metaphor to be introduced in its forthcoming Windows CardSpace software. Until early 2006, information cards were also sometimes referred to by the code-name “InfoCard”, which was not a name that was freely available for all to use. The name information card was specifically chosen as one that would be freely available for all to use, independent of any product or implementation. The name “information card” is not trademarked and is so generic as to not be trademarkable. The term i-card was introduced at the June 21, 2006, Berkman/MIT Identity Mashup conference. The intent was to define a term that was not associated with any industry TM or other IP or artifact. At the time, Microsoft had not yet finished applying the Open Specification Promise to the protocols underlying Windows CardSpace and there was also a misunderstanding that the term information card was not freely available for use by all, so to be conservative, the term i-card was introduced. Mike Jones, of Microsoft, explained to participants of a session at IIW 2007b that Microsoft always intended the term information card to be used generically to describe all kinds of information cards and to be freely usable by all, and tried to correct the earlier misunderstanding that the term might apply only to the kinds of information cards originally defined by Microsoft. He made the case that the industry would be better served by having everyone use the common term information card, than having two terms in use with the same meaning, since there remains no legal or technical reason for different terms. In this case the term i-card would become just the short form of information card, just like e-mail has become the short form of electronic mail. == Software implementations == DACS – open source RP & Information Card STS written in C.

              " 'The PC 1715 was an office computer produced by VEB Robotron in East Germany starting in 1985. The system featured an 8-bit microprocessor, the U880, a clone of the Zilog Z80. It was built for office work and education, but was also put to some specialist uses, for example an optional interface was available for controlling a pacemaker. The 1715 had minimal graphics and sound capabilities. The price was 19,000 East German marks. In contrast to the A5120 predecessor, the PC1715 was not built around the K1520 bus standard. There was no back plane, but the main board had 2 58-pin connectors that were largely K1520 compliant, with some signals omitted and replaced with custom internal signals. The floppy controller of the PC1715 used one of those internal bus extensions and was built with discrete components and logic chips, whereas other robotron computers of the 1980s used a clone of an Intel 8272 Floppy disk controller. The floppy controller board clearly appears to be based on the one used in the A5120. The graphics subsystem on the other hand was part of the main board circuitry and relied on a Intel 8275 compatible CRT controller with a portion of main memory used as video memory. A second U880 processor was used in the keyboard, together with a small firmware ROM to decode the keyboard matrix and transmit the keycode via a serial link to the main board. Though it was common practice at the time for processors that failed normal quality tests to be reused with much reduced clock frequencies and this may have been the case here. In 1987, a new version was produced, the PC 1715W (1715M in the Soviet Union). The system was identical to the PC 1715, except the processor was clocked at 4 MHz and the machine had 256KiB DRAM. In total, about 93,000 PC 1715 and PC 1715W units were manufactured. An estimated 50,000 of those were exported to the Soviet Union. In March 1987, a stamp was issued by the German Democratic Republic featuring the PC 1715. 8 million copies were printed. == Images == == See also == History of computer hardware in Eastern Bloc countries == References ==',\n",

              " 'A private road is a road owned or controlled by a private person, persons or corporation rather than a road open to the public and owned by a government. Private roads can be on private land or can be constructed on government land for use by government agencies or by agreements for access to private facilities. Private roads are private property and are not usually open to the public. Unauthorized use of a private road may be trespassing. In some cases, the owner of a private road may permit the general public to use the road. Road regulations that apply to a public road may not apply to private roads. Common types of private roads include roads retained in subdivisions of land but not dedicated to the public, residential roads maintained by a homeowners association, housing co-operative or other group of homeowners and roads for access to an industrial facilities such as forests, mines, power stations and telecommunications. == By country == There are also networks of private highways in Italy and other nations. Such highways typically are toll roads whose upkeep is paid for with user fees, for example, the Dulles Greenway in Virginia, United States. England and Wales are thought to have about 40,000 private roads. They are not normally the responsibility of the local authority, but the authority may provide services such as street lighting. They normally have to be maintained by residents. They are referred to as unadopted roads because they have not gone through the statutory process of adoption, for example under Highways Act 1980 s37 or s38. Even if not expressly or implicitly dedicated for public use, public use over time may nonetheless have created public rights of way; though by Part 6 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006, in force from 2 May 2006, many public rights of way for motor vehicles in private roads have now been extinguished. In Sweden, private road associations manage two thirds of the total road network. However, only four per cent of the total road transportation work is carried on them, mostly rural roads. In fact, only one per cent of the road transports are made on the half of the roads that do not receive government subsidies for their maintenance, with the bulk not receiving subsidies being built and maintained by the forestry industry as needed and most often closed to the public. New private roads that receive government support are often built by the government and transferred to the roads principal stakeholders, those living along it. These form a private road association to maintain it and get subsidies from the government to keep it open to the rest of the public. Even after factoring in the unpaid work of the members of the association, the cost of operation and maintenance is often considerably less than a comparable public road. Finland is similar, with 280,000 km of private roads and only 78,000 km of public roads.In Canada private roads are main access routes or private driveways onto private property. These roads are typically maintained by private owners of the land they occupy. Some private roads are maintained by a municipality and are open to the public. Many private roads do not have any name signage other than a sign indicating the ownership status; however, in some cities private roads are given conventional street names through the municipal addressing system. One notable private road, the Sultan Industrial Road in Northern Ontario, is 80 kilometres long and forms part of the only existing route between two major provincial highways; it is thus under a public access agreement permitting its use by the public, and nearly half of all traffic on the road in a 2016 study consisted of passenger vehicles rather than company trucks.In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, all roads of higher categories are public by law. Just the lowest category can be private. This category is called \"účelová komunikace\" (\"účelová komunikácia\" in Slovak), the adjective \"účelový\" can be translated as \"purpose-built\", special-purpose\" or \"utilitarian\". The road law distinguish \"publicly accessible\" and \"closed\" (in a closed area) special-purpose roads. This category includes roads that are used exclusively to connect a private structure or plots to the road network, but also field and forest roads, areas such as car parks, public transport terminals, roads within industrial, military, hospital or school premises and areas etc. Private roads outside closed areas are largely subject to public law and public traffic on them can be restricted only with the consent of state authorities (public accessibility of the landscape is also protected by law). In most cases, they are not distinguished from municipal or regional roads by any signs. == See also == Free-market road (concept of libertarian philosophies, specially anarcho-capitalism and minarchism) Private highway Private highways in the United States Dirt road == References ==',\n",

They moved up to Triple-A in 1985 as members of the American Association before joining the Pacific Coast League in 1998. With the restructuring of the minor leagues in 2021, they were placed in the Triple-A East, which became the International League in 2022. The first game of the new baseball season for a team is played on Opening Day, and being named the Opening Day starting pitcher is an honor which is given to the player who is expected to lead the pitching staff that season, though there are various strategic reasons why a team's best pitcher might not start on Opening Day. The Sounds have used 41 different Opening Day starters in their 45 seasons.Nashville's first Opening Day game was played against the Memphis Chicks at Tim McCarver Stadium in Memphis, Tennessee, on April 15, 1978. Bill Dawley was their starting pitcher that day; he took the decision in a game the Sounds lost, 4–2. Their first Opening Day game held at home was an 8–7 win against the Birmingham Barons at Herschel Greer Stadium on April 9, 1981. Starter Jamie Werly, who went on to win the Southern League Most Outstanding Pitcher Award that season, did not figure in the decision.On April 4, 2013, starter Tyler Thornburg took a no decision in the final Opening Day game at Greer Stadium, a 5–4 Sounds win. The team left Greer after the 2014 season, but did not play their first Opening Day game at First Horizon Park, their new facility then known as First Tennessee Park, until two years later. In that game, held on April 7, 2016, Sounds starting pitcher Chris Smith was charged with the loss in a 5–0 shutout by the Oklahoma City Dodgers. The 2020 Opening Day game, scheduled to be played at First Horizon Park on April 9, was postponed and ultimately cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Nashville's Opening Day starting pitchers have a combined Opening Day record of 11 wins, 15 losses, and 18 no decisions. At Greer Stadium, they had a record of 5 wins, 4 losses, and 8 no decisions in 17 Opening Day starts. At First Horizon Park, they have 0 wins, 2 losses, and 1 no decision in 3 Opening Day starts. They have an aggregate record of 5 wins, 6 losses, and 9 no decisions in 20 Opening Day starts at home. Nashville starters have a record of 6 wins, 9 losses, and 9 no decisions in 24 Opening Day starts on the road. The only Sounds pitchers with more than one Opening Day start are Bill Dawley (1978 and 1979), Rodney Imes (1990 and 1991), and Zach Jackson (2007 and 2008), each with two starts.

The theatre is named after Lawrence Batley, a local entrepreneur and philanthropist, who founded a nationwide cash and carry chain. The building was originally built in 1819 as a Methodist chapel, called the Queen Street Chapel. The architect is unknown but the chief mason was Joseph Kaye, the man who was also responsible for Huddersfield station. It was opened on 9 July 1819 and the reporter in the Leeds Mercury described it as \"one of the most handsome and commodious chapels in the kingdom; being capable of accommodating 3000 persons, and has been erected at an expense of from 8 to £10,000\". The chapel became a mission in 1906 until a decline in numbers saw the mission move out of the building in 1970 to a new building in King Street. In 1973 the building was converted into an arts centre. However serious structural problems were discovered by Kirklees Metropolitan Council in 1975 and the Arts Centre was rehoused into Venn Street Arts Centre and the building remained vacant before being sublet to Novosquash Limited and converted to a squash club known as The Ridings. It also housed a restaurant and a The Catacombs Disco. In 1989 the Kirklees Theatre Trust was given the go ahead to save the building from deterioration and launch Huddersfield\\'s newest theatre.

During Nordholm\\'s lifetime, tourism in Sweden expanded into one of the nation\\'s main revenue source, and Nordholm was a keen promoter of its transatlantic development. Nordholm initiated and headed the Swedish National Tourist Office 1921–1963, located in the Rockefeller Center in New York City, United States. He went on to serve as Managing Director for the Swedish State Railways Travel Information Agency as well as the Swedish-American Chamber of Commerce in New York City, and was a lifelong member of the Scandinavian Travel Commission.After World War II, as part of the Marshall Plan, Nordholm was appointed the initial Chairman (1949–1958) of the European Travel Commission by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. In addition, he was appointed President of the Conference of European Railroad Representatives. \"The ETC has come to be definitely recognised as the coordinating agency for all these interests and as such is able to attract other European travel advertising and promotion to support its own efforts and thereby present a vastly larger sales story to the American public than is possible with ETC funds alone.\" Following the simplification of visa regulations, customs procedures, and other formalities, as expressed in a 1952 edition of the This Week magazine, Birger Nordholm together with Arthur Haulot foregrounded the \"purposeful\" and \"educational\" dimension of \"a new type of tourism\" that would be \"the foundation of lasting peace\". This would eventually contribute to the development of the OECD Tourism Committee.Nordholm\\'s residences in New York City and Weston, Connecticut, would become centers of international festivities, including annual Midsummer celebrations held at his country house \"Tuckaway\", attended by ambassadors, consular heads, the press, Miss Sweden and other dignitaries, as well as friends and neighbours, and Nordholm became a well-known international speaker.He died in 1989 in Raleigh, Wake County, North Carolina, United States, with ashes buried at his country house \"Tuckaway\" in Connecticut. == Charities == Birger Nordholm promoted philanthropy to various international charities, such as to the humanitarian aid organization Finnish Relief Fund with purpose to assist civilians of Finland during the Winter War of World War II. He assisted cultural institutions such as the American Museum of Natural History, and was a member of the Swedish Pioneer Historical Society, and the American Swedish Historical Foundation behind the American Swedish Historical Museum.Nordholm was also a \"Founding Father\" and \"skålleage\" of the North American charter of the Skål International in New York City on 1 April 1938, with the objective to \"develop true friendship and common purpose among members of the tourist industry; through tourism, to promote mutual understanding and foster goodwill between the peoples of the world.\"The Birger Nordholm Foundation (Swedish: Birger Nordholms stiftelse) was posthumously established at his former secondary school Östra Real in Östermalm, Stockholm.

              " 'The Eel is an alias used by two fictional characters appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The first character to take up the identity was Leopold Stryke who first appeared in Strange Tales #112 (October 1963) created by Stan Lee and Dick Ayers, while his successor, Edward Lavell, first appeared in Power Man and Iron Fist #92 (April 1983). Both Eels were at one point members of the Serpent Squad even though the character they portray was not actually based on a snake, but on a fish that resembled a snake. Neither Eel has ever been featured as a regular character in any of Marvel\\'s ongoing or limited series. The original Eel, Leopold Stryke, wore a suit that could generate an electrical charge like an electric eel and was coated with a slippery substance. He was often depicted as a henchman, normally teaming up with other criminals such as Plantman, Porcupine, Scarecrow and Unicorn. He later became a founding member of the Serpent Squad along with his brother Jordan, the original Viper. He even worked for Madame Hydra, unaware that she had killed his brother. Stryke was killed by the Gladiator during a heist. The second Eel, Edward Lavell, started out as a foe of Power Man and Iron Fist, but later became a general henchman like the original Eel working for Justine Hammer\\'s Masters of Evil and the Maggia. At one point Lavall appeared to have been killed, but later appeared as part of the latest incarnation of the Serpent Squad led by Sin, the daughter of the Red Skull. Subsequently, the Eel became part of \"Serpent Solutions\", the next incarnation of the Serpent Society. == Publication history == The original Eel first appeared in Strange Tales #112 (September 1963), and was created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko. The character subsequently appears in Strange Tales #117 (February 1964), Daredevil #6 (February 1965), Fantastic Four Annual #3 (1965), X-Men #22-23 (July–August 1966), Captain America #158-159 (February–March 1973), #163 (July 1973), #180-181 (December 1974-January 1975), Defenders #36-38 (June–August 1976), and Ghost Rider #21-22 (December 1976-January 1977), in which he died. The character appeared posthumously in Alpha Flight Special Edition #1 (June 1992), Untold Tales of Spider-Man #11 (July 1996), and Marvel: Heroes and Legends #1 (October 1996). The original Eel received an entry in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition #17, and in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #2. The second Eel first appeared in Power Man and Iron Fist #92 (April 1983) and was created by Kurt Busiek and Denys Cowan. == Fictional character biography == === Leopold Stryke === Leopold Stryke was the first criminal known as the Eel. In Stryke\\'s first appearances, he battled the Human Torch when he stole a nuclear device. Stryke was also a teammate of Plantman, the original Porcupine, the Scarecrow and the original Unicorn when they worked as henchmen for Count Nefaria. He was dispatched to battle the original team of X-Men. He then served as a henchman of the original Mister Fear, along with the Ox, as part of the Fellowship of Fear.Leopold and his brother Jordan, who was the original Viper, were later members of the original Serpent Squad. This first lineup battled Captain America. Leopold also aided the Serpent Squad in a plot to raise the continent of Lemuria. They battled the original Nomad and Namor the Sub-Mariner. When Madame Hydra reorganized the second Serpent Squad, Leopold remained unaware that she had murdered his brother and taken his alias. Leopold Stryke is fatally mutilated in Las Vegas by the Gladiator, who was sent to acquire a disintegrator ray that the Eel had in his possession. === Edward Lavell === Edward Lavell is first seen attempting to break Hammerhead out of prison. He battles Power Man and Iron Fist. Later working with Nightshade, the Eel is defeated again by Iron Fist and reformed criminals Discus and Stiletto.The Eel is seen working with the criminals Blitz and the Vanisher. The trio is defeated by Spider-Man. Lavell also aids a group of villains attacking the Fantastic Four.In hopes of gaining revenge against the criminal Mister Hyde, the Eel arranged a murder of a woman he had befriended, framing Hyde. Lavell also secretly impersonated \"Snake\" Marston, joining his team, the Enforcers, and led them in throwing off Daredevil’s attempts to find the true killer. Ultimately, the Eel sucker-punched Daredevil and gloated of his plans, but the Enforcers overheard and turned on him. The Eel was taken into court to clear Hyde’s name and was remanded to custody.Lavell was a member of Justine Hammer\\'s Masters of Evil, and is defeated by the Thunderbolts. After the Masters of Evil are apprehended, he was seen among the Maggia leaders assembled by the Grim Reaper who tried to claim leadership of the scattered, fractious families on behalf of Count Nefaria. He was captured when the Avengers invaded the meeting place. The Eel once worked against Hammerhead, transporting the Lifeline Tablet on behalf of Caesar Cicero, although Hammerhead soon recovered the Tablet for his own purposes.Lavell was next seen participating in the Bloodsport tournament at Madripoor. There, he put on a poor showing. He is defeated by the Toad, who seemingly crushes Lavell using his extremely long and powerful tongue.Lavell apparently survives the fight and is briefly seen as a client for the law firm Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg & Holliway. He is discussing action to be taken against Power Man and refers to an \\'Eel-Mobile\\'.Lavell plays a small role in the \"Secret War\" crossover event.During the Civil War storyline, the Eel is apprehended by the Thunderbolts to serve in the so-called Thunderbolt Army.Following the disbanding of the Thunderbolt Army, the Eel was among the villains at Stilt-Man\\'s funeral at the Bar with No Name at which Punisher poisoned the drinks and then blew up the bar.Lavell turned up as a member of a new Serpent Squad led by Sin, the daughter of the Red Skull. He participates in several murderous missions, including one intended to damage the Asian stock markets. He breaks Crossbones out of jail and later attacked the White House, but he was stopped by the new Captain America.During the Original Sin storyline, the Eel is relaxing in his lounge alongside his goons when he receives an unexpected visit from the Black Cat. The Eel taunts her with the fallout from her capture by the Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus\\' mind in Spider-Man\\'s body) and then attacks her. The Black Cat retaliates revealing her companion, Electro, who attacks the Eel\\'s goons while the Black Cat taunts the Eel saying that she will take everything from him. Mister Negative and Phil Urich (who is now leading the remnants of the Goblin Underground as the self-proclaimed Goblin King) are waiting for the Eel in order to divide the criminal underground after Norman Osborn\\'s downfall, but they are stunned by seeing the Eel crashing into the place when the Black Cat comes into view.As part of the All-New, All-Different Marvel event, the Eel appears as a member of the Viper\\'s Serpent Society under its new name of Serpent Solutions. == Powers and abilities == Leopold Stryke designed the original Eel costume, which consisted of electrically superconducting fabric sandwiched in between body insulation and a layer of near-frictionless synthetic fabric. The Eel costume featured small devices capable of generating large and small bursts of electricity. It could fire electrical bolts (initially only through his suit\\'s chest protector) and give off bright glows, as well as set up an electric current in the costume that would shock anyone touching it. The costume was coated with a greasy silicon substance (which was sometimes asbestos grease) that made it slippery. The costume could operate underwater. The battle suit also projects an electrical field which allows him to sense his surroundings, even in total darkness. The Eel used various weapons, including a specially designed helicopter, an Aqua-Attractor gun, and an Eel-Cannon. == References == == External links == Eel (Leopold Stryke) at Marvel.com Eel (Edward Lavell) Eel (Leopold Styke) at MarvelDirectory.com Eel (Leopold Stryke) at The Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe Eel (Edward Lavell) at The Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe Eel (Leopold Stryke) at Marvel Wiki Eel (Edward Lavell) at Marvel.com',\n",

              " 'The Osteiner Hof (\"Court of Ostein\") is one of several Baroque-era palatial mansions along Schillerplatz square in the German city of Mainz. The mansion, along the southern edge of the square, was built in 1747-1752 by architect-soldier Johann Valentin Thomann for Franz Wolfgang Damian von Ostein, brother of Johann Friedrich Karl von Ostein, who was prince-bishop of Mainz at that time. Characteristic features for this building are the three round protrusions (risalits) at the front entrance and on the two corners. The building is lavishly decorated; for instance, the windows are framed by rococo-style cartouches symbolising the elements of air, earth and water. The classical gods Diana and Mars are shown on the cartouches framing the balcony doors. The von Osteins, a dynasty of counts, were not able to make use of the mansion for very long. After the left bank of the Rhine was occupied by French Revolutionary armies, the mansion was appropriated by the state, and in 1798 it became the seat of a newly created département of France, Mont-Tonnerre. The building continued to be used as a seat of government after the Napoleonic era, even gaining the nickname Gouvernement during the years 1854-1859, while emperor-to-be Wilhelm I was serving as military governor of Mainz. During the early days of the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871), the Osteiner Hof served as military headquarters of a Prussian field marshal, Prince Frederick Charles of Prussia. In 1914, then-military governor General Hugo von Kathen announced the start of World War I to the Mainz populace from the balcony of the Osteiner Hof. The mansion was destroyed by fire during World War II, but was restored in 1947-1948. From 1958 until 2014, the Osteiner Hof was in use by the Bundeswehr as military headquarters and officers\\' mess. The Osteiner Hof plays an important part in the local carnival traditions. Every year, on 11 November at 11 past 11, the start of the carnival season is proclaimed from the balcony of the mansion. == Sources == Landeshauptstadt Mainz: Historisches Mainz: Der Osteiner Hof (German)',\n",

It is notable for the presence of one of General Wade's military roads, built at the time of the Jacobite risings in the eighteenth century. == Military road == This pass would be relatively obscure were it not for General Wade's military road built over it in 1731, between Fort Augustus in the Great Glen to the north and Melgarve in Strath Spey in the south. This path almost became the site of a major battle in the Jacobite rising of 1745, when Prince Charles Edward Stuart encamped at the height of the pass, and the Government commander approached from the south to quell the rebellion. The Government forces retreated due to the strongly entrenched position of the Jacobite Forces. == The pass today == The Highland Council states that the Corrieyairack Pass is not maintained as a public road, and is not suitable for use as one, so it advises against using motor vehicles on the pass. The road surface is made of stone, though it is now very eroded and damaged, and in many places the original paving has been lost. It is now used primarily by hikers and mountain bikers, as well as access for workers maintaining the adjacent electricity pylon line.

              " 'The Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909 or Bangkok Treaty of 1909 was a treaty between the United Kingdom and the Kingdom of Siam signed on 10 March 1909, in Bangkok.Ratifications were exchanged in London on 9 July 1909, and the treaty established the modern Malaysia–Thailand border. The area around modern Pattani, Narathiwat, southernmost Songkhla, Satun, and Yala remained under Thai control, where decades later the South Thailand insurgency would erupt. Thailand relinquished its claims to sovereignty over Kedah (Thai: ไทรบุรี, romanized: Saiburi), Kelantan (กลันตัน, Kalantan), Perlis (ปะลิส, Palit) and Terengganu (ตรังกานู, Trangkanu) which entered the British sphere of influence as protectorates. These four states, along with Johor, later became known as the Unfederated Malay States. == Background == The Kingdom of Siam was controlled by the monarch. Although there were many previous monarchs, those most responsible for maintaining Siam\\'s independence begins with Rama I (r.1782-1809). Unlike previous rulers, Rama I was a technocratic ruler who consulted with social elites on political matters and Sangha (Buddhist monks) on religious matters. His consultations with the Siamese elites became de rigueur for his successors.: 94 Rama I was succeeded by Rama II (r.1809-1824). Rama II\\'s greatest accomplishment was the establishment of a government of ministers. Near the end of his reign, in 1820, the British came on the scene seeking control of Penang. Rama II was followed by Rama III (r.1824-1851). He granted concessions to the British in exchange for their support. The same would be done later with the French.: 95 In 1826, in an effort to establish independence, Rama III and British officials signed the Burney Treaty. The treaty affirmed British assent that Kedah, Perlis, Terengganu, and Patani were Thai provinces while Penang and Province Wellesley belonged to the British and that the Siamese would permit British trade in Kelantan and Terengganu. After Rama III\\'s reign, a succession crisis brought Mongkut (r.1851-1868) to power. Under Mongkut\\'s leadership the Bowring Treaty of 1855 was signed. It provided British subjects in Siam with extraterritoriality, meaning that Britons would have British laws applied to them rather than Siamese. Mongkut constantly made concessions to the British and French to maintain independence in Siam until, in 1868, he was succeeded by Chulalongkorn, who ruled from 1868 to 1910. Chulalongkorn was a moderniser, similar to his predecessors. He abolished slavery, centralised revenues, created a national educational system, and safeguarded Siamese independence. == Treaty == The Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909, signed under the leadership of Chulalongkorn, consists of eight articles. In return for the four provinces Siam ceded in the treaty, extraterritorial protections for most Asian subjects of Britain were removed, and the Siamese government received a loan at 4 percent interest from the Federated Malay States to build a railway in southern Siam. === Article 1 === \"The Siamese government transfers to the British government all rights of suzerainty, protection, administration and control whatsoever which they possess over the states of Kelantan, Tringganu, Kedah, Perlis, and adjacent islands. The frontiers of these territories are defined by the boundary protocol annexed hereto.\" === Article 2 === The transfer provided for in the preceding article shall take place within thirty days after the ratification of this treaty. === Article 3 === A mixed commission, composed of Siamese and British officials and officers, shall be appointed within six months after the date of ratification of this treaty and shall be charged with the delimitation of the new frontier. The work of the commission shall be commenced as soon as the season permits, and shall be carried out in accordance with the boundary protocol annexed hereto. Subjects of his majesty the king of Siam residing within the territory described in article 1 who desire to preserve their Siamese nationality will, during the period of six months after the ratification of the present treaty, be allowed to do so if they become domiciled in the Siamese dominions. His Britannic majesty\\'s government under take that they shall be at liberty to retain their immovable property within the territory described in article 1. It is understood that in accordance with the usual custom where a change of suzerainty takes place, any concessions within the territories described in article 1 hereof to individuals or companies, granted by or with the approval of the Siamese government, and recognised by them as still in force on the date of the signature of the treaty, will be recognised by the government of his Britannic majesty. === Article 4 === His Britannic majesty\\'s government undertake that the government of the Federated Malay States shall assume the indebtedness to the Siamese government of the territories described in article 1. === Article 5 === The jurisdiction of the Siamese International Courts, established by article 8 of the treaty of 3 September 1883, shall, under the conditions defined in the jurisdiction protocol annexed hereto, be extended to all British subjects in Siam registered at the British consulates before the date of the present treaty. This system shall come to an end, and the jurisdiction of the International Courts shall be transferred to the ordinary Siamese courts after the promulgation and the coming into force of the Siamese codes, namely, the penal code, the civil and commercial codes, the codes of procedure, and the law for organisation of courts. All other British subjects in Siam shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the ordinary Siamese courts under the conditions defined in the jurisdiction protocol. === Article 6 === British subjects shall enjoy throughout the whole extent of Siam the rights and privileges enjoyed by the natives of the country, notably the right of property the right of residence and travel. They and their property shall be subject to all taxes and services, but these shall not be other or higher than the taxes and services which are or maybe imposed by law on Siamese subjects. It is particularly understood that the limitation in the agreement of 20 September 1900, by which the taxation of land shall not exceed that on similar land in Lower Burmah, is hereby removed. British subjects in Siam shall be exempt from all military service, either in the army or navy, and from all forced loans or military exactions or contributions. === Article 7 === The provisions of all treaties, agreements, and conventions between Great Britain and Siam, not modified by the present treaty remain in full force. === Article 8 === The present treaty shall be ratified within four months from its date. In witness where of the respective plenipotentiaries have signed the present treaty and affixed their seals.

              " 'The Vale of Belvoir ( (listen) BEE-vər) covers adjacent areas of Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire, England. The name derives from the Norman-French for \"beautiful view\" and dates back to Norman times. == Extent and geology == The vale is a tract of low ground rising east-north-east, with a somewhat ill-defined area. Its vale-like form can be viewed from either its south-east to eastern flank (the Belvoir \"ridge\") or from the north-west along the A46 (Roman Fosse Way) from which it is less conspicuous. It is the product of geological processes, being occupied in the main by the sedimentary mudstones and thin limestones of the Liassic (Lias), with a northern fringe from the upper parts of the Triassic (Mercia Mudstone and Rhaetic). The south-eastern margin is the most clearly defined because it is formed by a conspicuous scarp slope, on which Belvoir Castle sits about 330 feet (100 m) above the valley floor. Its resistance to erosion is due to a capping of relatively thick Jurassic Ironstone. The vale-like form is further constrained by cappings of ancient glacial till that form the higher ground along its western margin. In the Pliocene epoch (1.7 million years ago) the Vale of Belvoir was occupied by the \"Proto-Trent\" River, which cut a gap through the limestone ridge at Ancaster and then flowed on to the North Sea. At the end of the Wolstonian Stage (c. 130,000 years ago) a mass of stagnant ice left in the Vale of Belvoir caused the river to divert north along the old Lincoln river, through the Lincoln gap. == Settlements == === Nottinghamshire === === Leicestershire === === Lincolnshire === The relatively populous places in or beside the Vale of Belvoir include Bingham, Cotgrave, Keyworth and Bottesford. == Attractions == Belvoir Castle, which occupies a dominant position overlooking the vale, is the ancestral home of the family of the Dukes of Rutland. The castle saw significant damage in both the Wars of the Roses and the English Civil War and has consequently been rebuilt a number of times in its history. It is now open to the public, whilst still remaining a family home. In recent years the Belvoir name has become more widely known through the national and international sale of various cordials and other produce, a scheme introduced by the present duke\\'s father to raise funds for the continued upkeep of the castle and to provide employment in an otherwise farm-dominated local economy. Two other local specialities dominate the world reputation of the vale: Stilton cheese and pork pies. Of the six dairies currently allowed to produce true Stilton cheese under the terms of its protected origin status, only one is not located in the vale. The vale is the historic centre for the production of this king of English cheeses and until the end of the 19th century all Stilton cheese was being produced within 20 miles of Melton Mowbray. However, the cheese took its name from the Huntingdonshire village of Stilton, where it was served at coaching inns on the Great North Road. Melton is also the home of the Melton Mowbray pork pie, produced by traditional methods using uncured pork and hand-formed pastry and served cold. Both Stilton cheese and Melton Mowbray pies are covered by European Protected Designation of Origin orders. \"Belvoir Angels\" are a type of 18th-century Swithland slate tombstone found in the district. A comprehensive account of the natural history of the vale was compiled in 1790 by the poet George Crabbe, who was chaplain to the Duke of Rutland and later concurrent Rector of Muston, Leicestershire, and the adjacent Allington, Lincolnshire. It includes a list of more than 70 beetle species. The vale was renowned fox hunting country and had many historical ties to the sport.A controversial coalfield development was proposed in the 1970s. It became the subject of a public enquiry in 1979. The requisite planning applications were ultimately quashed by the secretary of state for the environment in 1982. The Vale of Belvoir has an award-winning radio station – 103 The Eye – which was the UK\\'s first community radio station and has been broadcasting since 2005. Based in Melton Mowbray, it is heard on 103 FM and on its website. == References == \"About Belvoir Castle\". Belvoir Castle official website.

              " 'Vinegar Lane is a development in the suburb of Grey Lynn in Auckland, New Zealand. The $250 million project was announced in 2006 under the name Soho Square Ponsonby and was meant to be a major attraction in the area with apartments, office space and retail areas. Construction started on the site of an old yeast manufacturing plant, but progress was slow and the developers had gone into receivership by the end of 2009. In May 2010 receivers signed a conditional contract with Innovus; this bid failed due diligence and Soho Square was back on the market in August 2010. In 2011 the site was purchased by Progressive Enterprises with a plan to open a supermarket, an underground carpark, and other retail shops. As of 2021 a building featuring an underground car park, retail, and office space has been completed, as have multiple residential buildings. == Planned location and features == The project was planned for the west end of Grey Lynn, Auckland, near Western Park. It was to occupy 1.3 hectares, almost the whole block within Williamson Avenue, Pollen Street and Crummer Road.The developer website stated that the site would contain 25,000m² of office space, 35 retail shops, 53 apartments and over 1250 undercover car parking spaces. == History of the site == From 1910 the site had been a yeast production plant. The former Dominion Yeast Company site was sold in 2004 by New Zealand Food Industries (now part of the international AB Mauri group) and up until that stage had been producing nearly all of the compressed yeast in New Zealand. The plant has since been moved to Hamilton.In 2006 the Marlin Group bought the place. The resulting proposal caused controversy: many in the area protested against the development. In 2008 resource consent was turned down. Protests against the development continued after construction had halted; one included a group of artists using the area as a swimming pool.By early 2010, the development had not progressed further than the initial excavation for five floors of planned underground car park. This site remained unused for some months, and Progressive Enterprises bought it in June 2011. Construction has completed on much of the site, which includes mix of retail and residential property and a large Countdown supermarket. The new development is called Vinegar Lane, and comprises two precincts, Cider and Vinegar, which reference the former use of the site. The Cider Building houses the Countdown supermarket, office space and retail, and the Vinegar precinct is mixed commercial and residential buildings. As of October 2021, many of the buildings in the Vinegar precinct have been completed, with some under construction and several empty lots remaining. == References == == External links == Soho Square - The company website is currently offline',\n",

              " 'The Berlin U-Bahn (German: [ˈuː baːn]; short for Untergrundbahn, \"underground railway\") is a rapid transit system in Berlin, the capital and largest city of Germany, and a major part of the city\\'s public transport system. Together with the S-Bahn, a network of suburban train lines, and a tram network that operates mostly in the eastern parts of the city, it serves as the main means of transport in the capital. Opened in 1902, the U-Bahn serves 175 stations spread across nine lines, with a total track length of 155.4 kilometres (96 miles 45 chains), about 80% of which is underground. Trains run every two to five minutes during peak hours, every five minutes for the rest of the day and every ten minutes in the evening. Over the course of a year, U-Bahn trains travel 132 million kilometres (82 million miles), and carry over 400 million passengers. In 2017, 553.1 million passengers rode the U-Bahn. The entire system is maintained and operated by the Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe, commonly known as the BVG. Designed to alleviate traffic flowing into and out of central Berlin, the U-Bahn was rapidly expanded until the city was divided into East and West Berlin at the end of World War II. Although the system remained open to residents of both sides at first, the construction of the Berlin Wall and the subsequent restrictions imposed by East Germany limited travel across the border. The East Berlin U-Bahn lines from West Berlin were severed, except for two West Berlin lines that ran through East Berlin (U6 and U8). These were allowed to pass through East Berlin without stopping at any of the stations, which were closed. Friedrichstraße was the exception because it was used as a transfer point between U6 and the West Berlin S-Bahn system, and a border crossing into East Berlin. The system was reopened completely following the fall of the Berlin Wall and German reunification. The Berlin U-Bahn is the most extensive underground network in Germany. In 2006, travel on the U-Bahn was equivalent to 122.2 million km (76 million mi) of car journeys. == History == The Berlin U-Bahn was built in three major phases: Up to 1913: the construction of the Kleinprofil (small profile) network in Berlin, Charlottenburg, Schöneberg, and Wilmersdorf; Up to 1930: the introduction of the Großprofil (large profile) network that established the first north–south lines; From 1953 on: further development after World War II.In a bid to secure its own improvement, Schöneberg also wanted a connection to Berlin. The elevated railway company did not believe such a line would be profitable, so the city built the first locally financed underground in Germany (intentionally using standard of Kleinprofil). It was opened on 1 December 1910. Just a few months earlier, work began on a fourth line to link Wilmersdorf in the southwest to the growing Berlin U-Bahn. The early network ran mostly east to west, connecting the richer areas in and around Berlin, as these routes had been deemed the most profitable. In order to open up the network to more of the workers of Berlin, the city wanted north–south lines to be established. In 1920, the surrounding areas were annexed to form Groß-Berlin (\"Greater Berlin\"), removing the need for many negotiations, and giving the city much greater bargaining power over the private Hochbahngesellschaft (\"elevated railway company\"). The city also mandated that new lines would use wider carriages—running on the same, standard-gauge track—to provide greater passenger capacity; these became known as the Großprofil (\"large profile\") network. Construction of the Nord-Süd-Bahn (\"North-South railway\") connecting Wedding in the north to Tempelhof and Neukölln in the south had started in December 1912, but halted for the First World War. Work resumed in 1919, although the money shortage caused by hyperinflation slowed progress considerably. On 30 January 1923, the first section opened between Hallesches Tor and Stettiner Bahnhof (Naturkundemuseum), with a continuation to Seestraße following two months later. Desperately underfunded, the new line had to use trains from the old Kleinprofil network; the carriages exits had to be widened to fill the gap to the platforms with wooden boards that passengers jokingly referred to as Blumenbretter (\"boards for flower pots\"). The line branched at Belle-Alliance-Straße, now (Mehringdamm); the continuation south to Tempelhof opened on 22 December 1929, the branch to Grenzallee on 21 December 1930. In 1912, plans were approved for AEG to build its own north–south underground line, named the GN-Bahn after its termini, Gesundbrunnen and Neukölln, via Alexanderplatz. Financial difficulties stopped the construction in 1919; the liquidation of AEG-Schnellbahn-AG, and Berlin\\'s commitment to the Nord-Süd-Bahn, prevented any further development until 1926. The first section opened on 17 July 1927 between Boddinstraße and Schönleinstraße, with the intermediate Hermannplatz becoming the first station at which passengers could transfer between two different Großprofil lines. The completed route was opened on 18 April 1930. Before control of the U-Bahn network was handed over completely to the BVG in 1929, the Hochbahngesellschaft started construction on a final line that, in contrast to its previous lines, was built as part of the Großprofil network. The major development was stopped in 1930. The seizure of power by the National Socialists brought many changes that affected Germany, including the U-Bahn. Most notably, the new national flag was hung in every station, and two of the stations were renamed. Extensive plans—mostly the work of architect Albert Speer—were drawn up that included the construction of a circular line crossing the established U-Bahn lines, and new lines or extensions to many outlying districts. Despite such grand plans, no U-Bahn development occurred. In the Nazi period the only addition to Berlin\\'s underground railways was North–South Tunnel of S-Bahn, opened 1936–1939. During the Second World War, U-Bahn travel soared as car use fell, and many of the underground stations were used as air-raid shelters; however, Allied bombs damaged or destroyed large parts of the U-Bahn system. Although the damage was usually repaired fairly quickly, the reconstructions became more difficult as the war went on. Eventually, on 25 April 1945, the whole system ground to a halt when the power station supplying the network failed. Upon unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany following the Battle for Berlin there were 437 damaged points and 496 damaged vehicles. The war had damaged or destroyed much of the network; however, 69.5 km (43.2 mi) of track and 93 stations were in use by the end of 1945, and the reconstruction was completed in 1950. Nevertheless, the consequent division of Berlin into East and West sectors brought further changes to the U-Bahn. Although the network spanned all sectors, and residents had freedom of movement, West Berliners increasingly avoided the Soviet sector and, from 1953, loudspeakers on the trains gave warnings when approaching the border, where passage of East Germans into the Western sectors also became subject to restrictions imposed by their government. There was a general strike on 17 June 1953 which closed the sections of the Berlin U-Bahn that traveled through East Berlin. Just after the strike, on the following day, train service on the line A was resumed and the service C was resumed to provide connections to Nordbahnhof and Friedrichstraße. Between 1953 and 1955, the 200-Kilometre-Plan was drawn up, detailing the future development of the U-Bahn, which would grow to 200 km (124.3 mi). Extending the C line to run from Tegel to Alt-Mariendorf was considered the highest priority: the northern extension to Tegel was opened on 31 May 1958. In order to circumvent East Berlin, and provide rapid-transport connections to the densely populated areas in Steglitz, Wedding, and Reinickendorf, a third north–south line was needed. The first section of line G was built between Leopoldplatz and Spichernstraße, with the intention of extending it at both ends. It had been planned to open the G line on 2 September 1961, but an earlier opening on 28 August was forced by the announcement of the construction of the Berlin Wall. The next crisis was followed by the Berlin Wall construction on 13 August 1961, which had split the city between east and west. The U2 was split into two sections, and for the north–south lines, trains were not allowed to stop for passengers and become Geisterbahnhöfe (\"ghost stations\"), patrolled by armed East-German border guards. Only at Friedrichstraße, a designated border crossing point, were passengers allowed to disembark. A further consequence over the years is that most of the Berlin S-Bahn passengers boycotted the Deutsche Reichsbahn, and transferred to the U-Bahn with numerous expansion. From 9 November 1989, following months of unrest, the travel restrictions placed upon East Germans were lifted. Tens of thousands of East Berliners heard the statement live on television and flooded the border checkpoints, demanding entry into West Berlin. Jannowitzbrücke, a former ghost station, was reopened two days later as an additional crossing point. It was the first station to be reopened after the opening of the Berlin Wall. Other stations, Rosenthaler Platz and Bernauer Straße on the U8 soon followed suit; and by 1 July 1990, all border controls were removed. In the decade following reunification, only three short extensions were made to U-Bahn lines. In the 1990s some stations in the eastern portion of the city still sported bullet-riddled tiles at their entrances, a result of World War II battle damage during the Battle of Berlin. These were removed by 21 December 2004. == U-Bahn network == === Routes === The U-Bahn has nine lines: === Stations === Among Berlin\\'s 170 U-Bahn stations there are many with especially striking architecture or unusual design characteristics: Hermannplatz station resembles something of a U-Bahn cathedral. The platform area is 7 metres high, 132 metres long and 22 metres wide. It was built in connection with the construction of the first North-South Line (Nord-Süd-Bahn), now the U8. The architecturally important department store Karstadt adjacent to the station, was being constructed at the same time. Karstadt contributed a large sum of money towards the decoration of the station and was in return rewarded with direct access from the station to the store. Hermannplatz was also the first U-Bahn station in Berlin to be equipped with escalators. Today, Hermannplatz is a busy interchange between the U7 and U8. Alexanderplatz station is another of the more notable U-Bahn stations in Berlin, and is an important interchange between three lines (U2, U5 and U8). The first part of the station was opened in 1913 along with an extension of today\\'s U2 line. In the 1920s Alexanderplatz was completely redesigned, both above and below ground. The U-Bahn station was expanded to provide access to the new D (today\\'s U8) and E (today\\'s U5) lines, then under construction. The result was a station with a restrained blue-grey tiled colour-scheme and Berlin\\'s first underground shopping facilities, designed by Alfred Grenander. Over the last few years Alexanderplatz station has, in stages, been restored; the work was due to be finished in 2007. Wittenbergplatz station is also unusually designed. It opened in 1902 as a simple station with two side platforms, designed to plans created by Paul Wittig. The station was completely redesigned by Alfred Grenander in 1912, with five platform faces, accommodating two new lines, one to Dahlem on today\\'s (U3), and the other to Kurfürstendamm, today\\'s Uhlandstraße (Berlin U-Bahn) on the (U1). A provision for a sixth platform was included but has never been completed. The redesign also featured a new entrance building, which blended into the grand architectural styles of Wittenbergplatz and the nearby KaDeWe department store. The interior of the entrance building was again rebuilt after considerable war damage during World War II, this time in a contemporary 1950s style. This lasted until the early 1980s when the interior was retro-renovated back into its original style. Wittenbergplatz station was presented with a London style \"Roundel type\" station sign in 1952, the 50th Anniversary of the Berlin U-Bahn. Today\\'s station is an interchange station between the U1, U2 and U3 lines. The name of the Gleisdreieck (rail triangle) station is reminiscent of a construction which can only be imagined today. The wye was built in the opening year 1902. Plans for a redesign were made soon after, because the wye was already obsolete. An accident on 26 September 1908, which claimed 18 to 21 lives, was the final straw. The redesign and expansion of the Turmbahnhof, during which the station was still used, took until 1912. After World War II the station was put back into service on 21 October 1945 (lower platform) and 18 November 1945 (upper platform). However, service was interrupted again by the construction of the Berlin Wall. From 1972 onwards no trains ran on the lower platform, because servicing the U2 was no longer profitable due to the parallel traffic on the U1. The lower platform was reactivated in 1983, when the test line of the M-Bahn was built from the Gleisdreieck to the Kemperplatz station. It was broken down again after the fall of the Berlin Wall, since it obstructed parts of the reopened U2. Since 1993 the U1 and U2 trains both service the station again. === Tickets === Berlin public transit passes are available from many places, automated and non-automated, from BVG, Bahn, and authorized third-parties. The Ring-Bahn Line and the other S-Bahn lines are included, as are all U-Bahn lines, buses, trams, ferries, and most trains within the city limits: tickets are valid for all transportation considered part of the Berlin-Regional public transit system. Ride-passes (tickets) are available in fare classes: Adult and Reduced. Children between the ages of six and 14 and large dogs qualify for the reduced fare. Children below the age of six and small dogs travel free. There are senior discounts in the form of an annual ticket. Residents who have applied for and received a German Disability Identification card confirming 80% or more disability (ID\\'s available from the Versorgungsamt, German Disability Office), can ride without a pass, including an additional person (as a helper). The disability identification card must be in the owner\\'s possession when traveling. With unemployment in the east averaging 15%, another common fare class in Berlin is the S(ocial)-Class. These identification cards are cleared through the normal government offices, then fulfilled at a BVG ride-pass non-automated location. Provided either by the Job Center (Arbeitsamt) for out-of-work residents or by the Sozialamt for people who cannot work or are disabled, the S-Class ride-passes normally restrict travel to the AB zones and must be renewed (a new pass purchased at a non-automated location) on the 1st of each month. Additional passes are available for those which want to bring a bicycle on the public transit system. A bicycle-pass is included in the Student-class ride-pass, which is provided through the universities. For small dogs which can be carried there is no additional fare requirement. For each \"large dog\", a reduced fare ride-pass must be purchased. Tourist ride-passes, all-day, group passes, and season passes include a dog fare. BVG ride-passes are issued for specific periods of time, and most require validation with a stamping machine before they are first used. The validation shows the date and time of the first use, and where the ticket was validated (in code), and therefore when the ticket expires. For example, once validated, an all-day pass allows unlimited use from the time of purchase to 3:00 am the following day. Unlike most other metro systems, tickets in Berlin are not checked before entering tram, U-Bahn or S-Bahn stations. They are however checked by the bus drivers upon entering. On the tram, S-Bahn and U-Bahn, a proof-of-payment system is used: there are random spot checks inside by plain-clothed fare inspectors who have the right to demand to see each passenger\\'s ticket. Passengers found without a ticket or an expired/invalid ticket are fined €60 per incident. The passenger may be required to pay on the spot, and is required on the spot to give a valid address to which the relevant fine notice can be mailed (it does not have to be in Germany). On the third incident, the BVG calls the offender to court, as there is now a history of \\'riding without paying\\'. Fare zonesBerlin is a part of the Verkehrsverbund Berlin-Brandenburg (Berlin-Brandenburg Transit Authority, VBB), which means ticketing and fare systems are unified with that of the surrounding state of Brandenburg. Berlin is divided into three fare zones, known as A, B, and C. Zone A is the area in the centre of Berlin and is demarcated by the S-Bahn urban rail ring line. Zone B covers the rest of the area within the city borders, and Zone C includes the immediate surroundings of Berlin. Zone C is divided into eight parts, each belonging to an administrative district. The Potsdam-Mittelmark area is included in the city district of Potsdam.Tickets can be bought for specific fare zones, or multiple zones. Most passengers who live in Berlin buy AB fare zone tickets, while commuters coming in from the suburbs need ABC fare zone tickets. If a ticket not valid for travel in a tariff zone is checked by a ticket inspector, the passenger is subject to a fine.Short-term tickets Single-journey tickets (Einzeltickets) are issued for use within specific fare zones, namely AB, BC, and ABC. They are only valid for two hours after validation, and cannot be extended. The BVG also offers single-day tickets (Tageskarte), which are valid for the entire day when first validated until 3 a.m. the next morning.Long-term tickets Long-term paper tickets are issued with validity periods of seven days (7-Tage-Karte), one month (Monatskarten), or one year (Jahreskarte). The BVG is in the process of introducing the plastic MetroCard as a yearly ticket that also has additional features. The Metrocard also permits passengers to make reservations for hire cars at specific times, for example on weekends. It is expected that plastic Metrocards without such features will also be made available as they are more durable and ecofriendly than the paper tickets.Tourist passes The BVG offers tickets directed specifically for non-resident tourists of Berlin called the WelcomeCard and CityTourCard [1]. WelcomeCards are valid for either 48 or 72 hours, and can be used by one adult and up to three children between the ages of six and 14. WelcomeCards are valid in fare zones ABC, and have the additional benefit of a reduction on entry fees to many museums and tourist attractions. See the Current Prices and Descriptions link for more information. === Underground facilities === A full GSM (GSM-900 and GSM-1800) mobile phone network for Germany\\'s four carriers is in place throughout the U-Bahn system of stations and tunnels. This system was in place by 1995 for the E-Plus network, and was one of the first metro systems in the world to allow mobile telephone use; by the late-1990s the other networks could be used in some portions as well. Since 2015, UMTS and LTE is also available for E-Plus and O2 (LTE since 2016) customers, and since 2020 mobile reception in some underground sections has also been extended to Deutsche Telekom and Vodafone Germany customers, with complete reception for the latter two telcos expected to be realised by mid-2021.Many of the carriages on the U-Bahn feature small flat screen displays that feature news headlines from BZ, weekly weather forecasts, and ads for local businesses. Most major interchange stations have large shopping concourses with banks, supermarkets, and fast food outlets. === Unused stations and tunnels === There are several stations, platforms and tunnels that were built in preparation for future U-Bahn extensions, and others that have been abandoned following planning changes. For example, platforms have already been provided for the planned \"U3\" at Potsdamer Platz on the planned line to Weißensee. It is unlikely that this line, which had the working title \"U3\" will ever be built, so the platforms have been partially converted into a location for events and exhibitions. The line number \"U3\" has been used to re-number the branch to Krumme Lanke, which had been part of \"U1\". Line D, today\\'s U8, was intended to run directly under Dresdner Straße via Oranienplatz to Kottbusser Tor. This segment of tunnel was abandoned in favour of a slightly less direct route in order to provide the former Wertheim department store at Moritzplatz with a direct connection. This involved the construction of a 90-degree curve of the line between Moritzplatz and Kottbusser Tor stations. The construction of the tunnel under Dresdner Straße had only been partially completed before abandonment, leaving it with only one track. This tunnel is separated into three parts, as it was blocked by a concrete wall where it crossed the border between East and West Berlin. Another concrete wall separates this tunnel, which now houses a transformer for an electricity supplier, from the never-completed Oranienplatz Station which is located partially under the square of the same name. Stralauer Tor was a station on the eastern bank of the Spree between Warschauer Straße and Schlesisches Tor stations. It was completely destroyed in World War II. It had been opened in 1902 and was renamed Osthafen in 1924. Today, only struts on the viaduct remain to indicate its location. In the post-Second World War period it was not thought necessary to rebuild the station, due its close proximity to the Warschauer Straße station. Also its location was directly on the border between the Soviet and American sectors. Although a Berlin map dated 1946 shows the station renamed as Bersarinstraße after the Soviet General responsible for restoring civil administration of the city, this name was used later at another location. Nürnberger Platz station was closed on 1 July 1959. It was replaced by two new stations on either side, Augsburger Straße and an interchange station to the U9 at Spichernstraße. Today, nothing remains of the station as a third track siding was constructed in its place. Another tunnel, which once connected the U4 to its original depot and workshop at Otzenstraße (Schöneberg), is still in existence. The connection from Innsbrucker Platz station to the depot was severed when a deep level motorway underpass was constructed in the early 1970s; however, the continuation of the tunnel at Eisackstraße is still in existence for a distance of 270 metres and now ends at the former junction to the workshop of the Schöneberg line. Platforms at five stations, Rathaus Steglitz, Schloßstraße, Walther-Schreiber-Platz, Innsbrucker Platz, and Kleistpark, were provided for the planned but never constructed U10. The U10 platform at Kleistpark has been converted into office space for the BVG. At Schloßstraße, U9 and U10 were planned to share two directional platforms at different levels; the would-be U10 tracks have been abandoned, leaving both platforms used by U9 trains only. The other U10 platforms remain unused and are not generally open to the public. During the construction of Adenauerplatz (U7) station, which was built in conjunction with an underpass, platforms were also provided for a planned U1 extension from Uhlandstraße to Theodor-Heuss-Platz. A short tunnel section was also constructed in front of the Internationales Congress Centrum (ICC), beneath the Messedamm/Neue Kantstraße junction. This tunnel was built concurrently with a pedestrian subway and was also intended for the planned extension of the U1. The tunnel section, approximately 60 metres long, ends at the location of the planned Messe station adjacent to Berlins central bus station (ZOB). The tunnel is used as a storage area for theater props. At Jungfernheide station, double U-Bahn platforms similar to those at Schloßstraße were built for the planned extension of the U5. The unused platform sides are fenced off. The finished (U5) tunnel section which leads off towards Tegel airport is now used for firefighting exercises. On 4 December 2020, the U5 extension between Alexanderplatz and Brandenburger Tor was opened. This included the new Unter den Linden station, which acts as a transfer point between the lines U5 and U6. Französische Straße station on the U6 was simultaneously closed due to its short distance to the new station. === Future development === Berlin\\'s chronic financial problems make any expansion not mandated by the Hauptstadtvertrag—the document that regulates the necessary changes to the city as the capital of Germany—unlikely. Furthermore, there is still great rivalry for construction money between the U-Bahn and the S-Bahn. After the construction boom that followed the reunification of the city, enthusiasm for further growth has cooled off; many people feel that Berlin\\'s needs are adequately met by the present U- and S-Bahn. As of 2020, the only proposals receiving serious consideration aim to facilitate travel around the existing system, such as moving Warschauer Straße\\'s U-Bahn station closer to its S-Bahn station. There are several long-term plans for the U-Bahn that have no estimated time of completion, most of which involve closing short gaps between stations, enabling them to connect to other lines. This would depend on demand, and new developments in the vicinity. New construction of U-Bahn lines is frequently the subject of political discussion with the Berlin chapters of the CDU, FDP and AfD who usually advocate in favor of U-Bahn expansion while the SPD, Die Grünen and Die Linke typically advocate for tram construction instead. After the last extension of U5 opened on 4 December 2020, there are no immediate plans to expand the metro system due to lack of budgetary conditions, although there are several extensions of railway lines that can be discussed over time: == Rolling stock == The Berlin U-Bahn uses 750-volt DC electric trains that run on standard gauge (1,435 mm (4 ft 8+1⁄2 in) ) tracks. The first trains were based on trams; they have a width of 2.30 m (7 ft 6+9⁄16 in), and take their power from an upward facing third rail. To accommodate greater passenger numbers without lengthening the trains—which would require costly extended platforms—trains that ran on lines built after World War I were required to be wider. The original trains and lines, which continued to operate, were designated Kleinprofil (small profile), and the newer, wider trains and lines were designated Großprofil (large profile). Großprofil trains are 2.65 m (8 ft 8+5⁄16 in) wide, and take their power from a downward facing third rail. This is similar to New York City\\'s A Division and B Division systems, where the B Division trains are wider than A Division trains (though B Division trains are also longer, while Großprofil trains are generally about the same length as Kleinprofil ones). Although the two profiles are generally incompatible, Kleinprofil trains have been modified to run on Großprofil lines during three periods of economic difficulty. Between 1923 and 1927 on the Nord-Süd-Bahn, and between 1961 and 1978 on the E line, adapted Kleinprofil trains were used to compensate for the lack of new Großprofil trains: they were widened with wooden boards to reach the platforms; and had their power pickups adapted to accept power from the negatively charged downward-facing third rail, instead of positively charged upward-facing third rail. As of 2017, Class IK Kleinprofil trains are in operation on the Großprofil line U5, after refurbishing the existing F79 rolling stock was deemed unfeasible. They were widened with metal boards by 17.5 cm (6.9 in) on each side and elevated by 7.5 cm (3.0 in) to close the gap to the platforms; their power pickups were designed reversible to work on both profiles. As of October 2019, IK rolling stock is still used on the U5; it is intended to move the trains to Kleinprofil lines once new Großprofil rolling stock has been delivered. As of 2007, Kleinprofil trains run on the U1, U2, U3, U4 and U5 lines; and Großprofil trains operate on the U5, U55, U6, U7, U8, and U9 routes. === Kleinprofil (small profile) === Kleinprofil trains are 2.30 m (7 ft 6+9⁄16 in) wide, and 3.10 m (10 ft 2+1⁄16 in) high. When the U-Bahn opened in 1902, forty-two multiple units, and twenty-one railroad cars, with a top speed of 50 km/h (31.1 mph), had been built at the Warschauer Brücke workshop. In contrast to the earlier test vehicles, seating was placed along the walls, facing inward, which was considered more comfortable. Until 1927, U-Bahn trains had smoking compartments and third-class carriages. The trains were first updated in 1928; A-II carriages were distinguished by only having three windows, and two sliding doors. After the division of the city, West Berlin upgraded its U-Bahn trains more rapidly than did East Berlin. The A3 type, introduced in 1960, was modelled on the Großprofil D type, and received regular modifications every few years. Meanwhile, A-I and A-II trains operated exclusively in East Berlin until 1975, when G-I trains, which had a top speed of 70 km/h (43.5 mph), started to travel the Thälmannplatz–Pankow route. These were superseded in 1988 by the G-I/1 type, which used couplings that were incompatible with the older G-I carriages. Following reunification, the A3L type was again upgraded as the A3L92. In 2000, prototypes for a Kleinprofil variant of the H series were built; the HK, the first Kleinprofil type to use AC induction motors like their large counterparts, differs from its Großprofil counterpart by not being fully interconnected—carriages are only interconnected within each of the two half-trains. As of 2005, only trains of the HK, G-I/1 and A3(U/L) types are in active service. From 2017, new IK-type trains will enter service to replace the remaining examples of type A3L71. Like HK-type trains they will be interconnected and as a result of their regenerative braking will recuperate up to 20% of the energy they require. === Großprofil (large profile) === Großprofil trains are 2.65 m (8 ft 8+5⁄16 in) wide, and 3.40 m (11 ft 1+7⁄8 in) high. The first sixteen multiple units and eight ordinary carriages entered active service on the Nord-Süd-Bahn in 1924, after a year of using modified Kleinprofil trains. Designated B-I, the cars were 13.15 m (43 ft 1+11⁄16 in) long and each had three sliding doors; the large elliptical windows at the front of the train earned them the nickname, Tunneleulen (tunnel owls). Upgraded B-II trains were introduced in 1927, and continued to be used until 1969. The first 18-metre-long (59 ft 11⁄16 in) C-I trains were trialled in 1926, and two upgrades were produced before the end of the decade. The first U-Bahn trains to use aluminium in their construction, the C-IV types, were introduced in 1930. Many C-type trains were seized by Soviet forces in 1945, to be used in the Moscow Metro. The first D-type trains, manufactured in 1957, were built from steel, making them very heavy and less efficient; however, the DL type that followed from 1965 used metals that were less dense, allowing a 26% reduction in weight. In East Berlin, D-type trains bought from the BVG were designated D-I. Difficulties there in trying to develop an E series of trains led, in 1962, to the conversion of S-Bahn type 168 trains for use on the E line. These E-III trains were desperately needed at the time to allow modified Kleinprofil trains to return to the increasingly busy A line but, following reunification, high running costs led to their retirement in 1994. In West Berlin, the successor to the D-type was the F-type, which debuted in 1973. They varied from other models in having seats that were perpendicular to the sides of the train; from 1980, they also became the first U-Bahn trains to use three-phase electricity. In 1995, the original seating arrangement returned as the H series took up service. H-type trains are characterised by the interconnection of carriages throughout the length of the train; and they can only be removed from the tracks at main service depots. As of 2005, only F, H, and a variation of the IK-type trains are in active service. === Depots === Depots of the Berlin U-Bahn fall into one of two classes: main workshops (German: Hauptwerkstätten, abbreviated as Hw); and service workshops (German: Betriebswerkstätten, abbreviated Bw). The main workshops are the only places where trains can be lifted from the tracks; they are used for the full inspections required every few years, and for any major work on trains. The service workshops only handle minor repairs and maintenance, such as replacing windows, or removing graffiti. As of 2005, the only dedicated Kleinprofil depot is at Grunewald (Hw Gru/Bw Gru), which opened on 21 January 1913. The first Großprofil depot opened at Seestraße (Hw See/Bw See) in 1923, to service the Nord-Süd-Bahn. It has 17 tracks—2 for the main workshop, and 15 for the service workshop—but its inner-city location prevents any further expansion. Due to BVG budget cuts, the Seestraße depot also services Kleinprofil trains. Two further Großprofil service workshops are located at Friedrichsfelde (Bw Fri), and Britz-Süd (Bw Britz). In the past, there were other workshops. The first opened in 1901 at Warschauer Brücke, and was the construction site for most of the early U-Bahn trains. The division of the U-Bahn network on 13 August 1961 forced its closure, although it was reopened in 1995 as a storage depot. A small depot operated at Krumme Lanke between 22 December 1929 and 1 May 1968; and, while the network was split, East Berlin\\'s U-Bahn used the S-Bahn depot at Schöneweide, along with a small service workshop at Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz, which was closed following reunification. == Accidents == The Berlin U-Bahn ranks among the safest modes of transport: its history features few accidents. The most severe accident occurred at the original Gleisdreieck (rail triangle), where the main and branch lines were connected by switches that allowed the tracks to cross. On 26 September 1908, a train driver missed a stop signal. As a result, two trains collided at the junction, and one fell off the viaduct. The accident killed eighteen people, and severely injured another twenty-one. Gleisdreieck\\'s triangular layout had already been deemed unsuitable for future developments; this incident—and a later, less-serious one—triggered its reconstruction as a multi-level station, starting in 1912.On 30 June 1965, a train with brake failure stopped on the G line—today\\'s U9—between Zoologischer Garten and Hansaplatz. Unaware of the faulty train, a mechanic working at the Zoologischer Garten signal tower noticed that the signal for the affected section had been set to \"Stop\" for a long time. Thinking it was a fault of his, after several attempts he manually overrode the signal, in defiance of regulations that strictly prohibited such actions. The following train, which had been waiting at Zoologischer Garten, then left the station on the same track. With emergency brakes unable to prevent the accident, the two trains collided. One passenger was killed in the crash, and 97 were injured. The mechanic was fined 600,000 DM.Fires can be particularly dangerous and damaging within an underground system. In October 1972, two trains and a 200 m length of tunnel were completely destroyed when the trains caught fire; the reconstructed tunnel is clearly distinguishable from the old one. Another train burned out in the connecting tunnel between Klosterstraße and Alexanderplatz in 1987. On 8 July 2000, the last car of a GI/I train suffered a short circuit, burning out at the rear of the Deutsche Oper station. The single exit of the station was unreachable, forcing the passengers to run through the tunnel to reach the next emergency exit. The fire also damaged the station, which remained closed until that September. The Portuguese Ambassador, João Diogo Nunes Barata, presented the BVG with azulejos (tiled paintings), specially designed for the station, by the artist José de Guimarães. Installation of Portugal\\'s gift to the city was completed on 30 October 2002. As a consequence of the Deutsche Oper incident, BVG decided to post an employee at every station with only one exit until a second exit could be built. Over the following few years, many of those stations—including Britz-Süd, Schillingstraße, Viktoria-Luise-Platz, Uhlandstraße, and Theodor-Heuss-Platz—were retrofitted with additional exits. By June 2008, the only remaining stations with no second exit, Konstanzer Straße and Rudow, had been fitted with second exits. Despite these changes, several passenger organisations—such as Pro Bahn, and IGEB—demand that stations with exits in the middle of the platform also be fitted with additional emergency exits. Many stations are built this way; meeting those demands would place a heavy financial burden on both the BVG and the city.The U6 saw a particularly costly, though casualty-free, incident on 25 March 2003. Scheduled repair work on the line limited the normal service to between Alt-Mariendorf and Kurt-Schumacher-Platz; one train then shuttled back and forth between Kurt-Schumacher-Platz and Holzhauser Straße, sharing a platform at Kurt-Schumacher-Platz with the normal-service trains departing for their return journey to Alt-Mariendorf. Needing to pass several stop signals on the shuttle service, the driver had been given special instructions how to proceed. Unfortunately, he ignored the signal at the entry to Kurt-Schumacher-Platz, and ploughed into the side of a train heading back to Alt-Mariendorf. The impact wrecked both trains, and caused considerable damage to the tracks. Normal service did not resume for two days, and the removal of the two wrecked trains—which, surprisingly, could still roll along the tracks—also took nearly 48 hours. == Films, music and merchandising == The Berlin U-Bahn has appeared in numerous films and music videos. Offering access to stations, tunnels, and trains, the BVG cooperates with film-makers, although a permit is required.Whether set in Berlin or elsewhere, the U-Bahn has had at least a minor role in a large number of movies and television programmes, including Emil and the Detectives (2001), Otto – Der Film (1985), Bang! You\\'re Dead! (1987) featuring Ingolf Lück, Run Lola Run (1998), and several Tatort episodes. The previously unused Reichstag station was used to shoot scenes of the movies Resident Evil and Equilibrium. The U Bahn station Messe was used as coverage in the films Hanna and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2. Möbius 17, by Frank Esher Lämmer and Jo Preussler from Berlin, tells the story of an U-Bahn train that, caught in a Möbius strip, travels through alternate universes after a new line is built. Alexanderplatz station plays an essential role in Berlin Alexanderplatz—a film of thirteen hour-long chapters and one epilogue—produced in 1980 by Rainer Werner Fassbinder, based on the book by Döblin. The film\\'s scenes feature a recreation of the station as it was in 1928—rather darker and dirtier than in the 21st century. In the surrealistic two-hour epilogue, Fassbinder transforms parts of the station into a slaughterhouse where people are killed and dissected. Since 2001, the Berlin U-Bahn has hosted the annual short-film festival Going Underground. Short films (up to 90 seconds long) are shown on the monitors found in many of the U-Bahn trains. Passengers on board vote for the festival winner. Sandy Mölling, former singer of the pop band No Angels, shot the video for her single \"Unnatural Blonde\" in the U-Bahn station Deutsche Oper. Kate Ryan, Overground, Böhse Onkelz, Xavier Naidoo, Die Fantastischen Vier, and the DJ duo Blank & Jones have all used the U-Bahn and its stations for their videos as well. \"Linie 1\", a musical performed by Berlin\\'s Grips-Theater, is set completely in stations and trains of the Berlin U-Bahn; a movie version has also been produced. In 2002, the BVG cooperated with design students in a project to create underwear with an U-Bahn theme, which, in English, they named \"Underwear\". They used the names of real stations that, in the context of underwear, appeared to be mild sexual double entendres: men\\'s underpants bore labels with Rohrdamm (pipe dam), Onkel Toms Hütte (Uncle Tom\\'s Cabin), and Krumme Lanke (crooked lake); the women\\'s had Gleisdreieck (triangle track), and Jungfernheide (virgin heath). After the first series sold out quickly, several others were commissioned, such as Nothammer (emergency hammer), and Pendelverkehr (shuttle service; though Verkehr also means \"intercourse\" and Pendel also means \"pendulum\"). They were withdrawn from sale in 2004. == See also == == References == == Bibliography == == External links == Berlin Metro Map on Google Maps with Geolocation Official website (in English) VSWB – Disused Rails and Lanes in Berlin Photo tour of U-Bahn stations including map of architectural styles pics of Berlin Metro Track map of the Berlin U-Bahn Berlin U-Bahn Map Photographing the Berlin U-Bahn',\n",

              " 'Little Crackers is a British Christmas comedy-drama that was broadcast on Sky1. It consists of a series of short films featuring stars of British and Irish comedy, including Stephen Fry, Catherine Tate, Chris O\\'Dowd, Kathy Burke, Victoria Wood, and Bill Bailey. According to Sky Television, the show marked the start of their biggest investment in British comedy during Sky1\\'s twenty-year history. The success of the first series led Sky to renew the show for a second series, which began airing on 18 December 2011. The comedians involved in the second series included Harry Hill, Sheridan Smith, Sanjeev Bhaskar, John Bishop, Shappi Khorsandi and Jack Whitehall. Moone Boy, created by and starring Chris O\\'Dowd for Sky1, and Walking and Talking, written by and starring Kathy Burke for Sky Atlantic, are both full series based on Little Crackers shorts. They have been commissioned for 6 episodes and 4 episodes respectively. == Summary == In the films, the stars – with the help of rising young actors such as Madeleine Power as the young Catherine Tate – recreate stories from their childhood. The films, which last between 10 and 12 minutes each, include Catherine Tate reenacting an occasion when she decided to mimic the controversial singer Gary Glitter in a school nativity; Stephen Fry as a head teacher doling out corporal punishment to his younger self played by Daniel Roche; and Dawn French as the Queen Mother, whom she met at the age of four. David Baddiel, Julian Barratt, Bill Bailey, Jo Brand, Victoria Wood, Chris O\\'Dowd and Julia Davis are among the other actors who recreate childhood incidents and memories.Catherine Tate\\'s Little Cracker, My First Nativity, was nominated for Best Comedy Programme, at the British Academy Television Awards 2011. It was beaten by BBC Two\\'s Harry and Paul. == Production == The series was commissioned by Sky1 after the success of the short film series 10 Minute Tales in 2009. That series featured 12 silent short films of around 8 minutes in length and starred popular British actors (including Bill Nighy) and was directed by Ian Rickson.Two of the episodes were produced by Silver River. The titles of the two episodes were revealed as \"First Kiss\" and \"Satan\\'s Hoof\", starring Julia Davis and Julian Barratt respectively. A further three episodes were produced by Tiger Aspect: \"Better Than Christmas\", \"The Queen Mother\\'s Visit\" (alternatively known as \"Operation Big Hat\") and \"My First Nativity\".The first series of Little Crackers saw Catherine Tate, Julia Davis and Bill Bailey, marking their directorial debuts. == Broadcast == The show began airing on Sky1 and in high definition on Sky1 HD on 19 December 2010. Two episodes were broadcast each evening until 23 December, while the final two episodes were broadcast on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. The Meera Syal short was the UK\\'s first ever scripted TV comedy broadcast in 3D.A second series of 11 episodes was broadcast on Sky1 from 18 to 23 December 2011.

              " \"The Chen-Kao reaction (named after Ko Kuei Chen and Chung-Hsi Kao, Madison, Wisconsin 1926) is a chemical method for determining the presence of pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and similar phenylalkylamines. The reaction is used in spot tests and is also known as Chen-Kao test (or simply as Chen, Test T in UN Precursor Test Kit). The test is often used to distinguish ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, norephedrine, cathinone and methcathinone from amphetamine and methamphetamine, which do not react with Chen’s test reagent. == Testing Method == The Chen-Kao test is performed by creating an acidic solution of the compound to be tested and adding dilute Copper (II) Sulfate and Sodium hydroxide solutions.The procedure is as follows: Place small amount of material to be tested on a spot plate. Add 2 drops of reagent A Add 2 drops of reagent B Add 2 drops of reagent C A violet color indicates presence of ephedrine or pseudoephedrine Reagent A - 1% (vol/vol) aqueous acetic acid solution Reagent B - dissolve 1g Copper(II) sulfate in 100ml water Reagent C - dissolve 8g of NaOH in 100ml of water (that is 2N NaOH solution) Further, the coordination complex might be extracted with organic solvent like diethyl Ether or n-butanol (see Table II), as proposed in the literature, which provides additional confirmation of the original results, but no further differentiation. This modification is not included in the UN Precursor Test Kit and other spot tests alike. In order to further differentiate between ephedrine enantiomers - ephedrine, pseudoephedrine and other ephedrine-related compounds, Simon’s test (with acetaldehyde) and Simon’s test (with acetone) are used. (see Table III) == Reaction mechanism == When acidic solution of ephedrine or pseudoephedrine is mixed with copper sulfate and sodium hydroxide solutions, a violet color is formed. Upon shaking with ether, the organic phase turns red/purple and the aqueous phase turns blue. The staining is based on the formation of a coordination complex of two ephedrine molecules and a copper ion Cu2+This works, because, in an alkaline solution, the hydroxyl and amine groups are de-protonated, leaving a negative charge on the central atoms. They can then form a coordination complex with the positively-charged cupric ions from the copper sulfate. Phenethylamines (and their derivatives) that have a β-ketone group will also react, but less predictably and dramatically (the carbonyl oxygen is less nucleophilic than the deprotonated hydroxyl group). They usually form a deeper blue color, and often a grey-ish precipitate. This includes the cathinones and presumably βK-2C-x compounds. == Description == The execution of the Chen-Kao reaction is simple, needs little practice and limited skills. Also, the violet color obtained in the reaction is easy to define. For a correct execution, it is important to note that the typical colors develop relatively slowly, and that a good color intensity requires a sample of a few milligrams of the substances tested (i.e., more than what would typically be required for most other tests included in the UN test kits). Of all ephedrine-related compounds, only ephedrine and pseudoephedrine produce the typical, stable violet color. Other ephedrine-related compounds produce a blue to greenish-blue precipitate. This precipitate could be seen as characteristic for the members of the ephedrine group other than pseudoephedrine and ephedrine itself, hence, the Chen-Kao test appears to show a significant specificity within the ephedrine group. However, it is known from previously published cross-testing work that various pharmaceuticals not related to the ephedrine group may produce similar blue copper complexes. The two keto-amines, cathinone and methcathinone, initially also produce blue-colored complexes with the Chen-Kao reagent. However, a slow transition of the initial color into yellow, followed by an orange-brown color can be observed with both compounds, thus indicating the instability of the complexes initially formed, and an obvious decomposition of the two compounds under the alkaline conditions of this color reaction. The results of the solvent extractions, summarized in Table II appear to add little novelty to the results of the original Chen-Kao reactions. However, in cases of doubts, they may serve as confirmatory steps. == Results == == See also == Drug test Drug checking Drug testing reagents Marquis reagent Scott test Froehde reagent Duquenois–Levine reagent Ehrlich's reagent Gold(III) bromide Dille–Koppanyi reagent Liebermann reagent Mandelin reagent Mecke reagent Simon's reagent Zwikker reagent == References ==\",\n",

              " 'The Chee Kung Tong Society Hall was a former Chinese society hall located on 2151 Vineyard Street in Wailuku, Maui. Built to provide services to single immigrant Chinese males, mostly working for the sugarcane plantations, it provided religious and political help, in addition to mutual aid. Converted to a dormitory in the 1920s, it suffered neglect until finally collapsing in 1996. The site now contains remnants of the foundation, assorted cement structures, and a distinct lintel gate and wall facing the street. The site was placed on the Hawaii State Register of Historic Places and the National Register of Historic Places (under the Chinese Tong Houses of Maui Island TR nomination form), but delisted from the State register after its collapse; it is still listed in the NRHP database. == History == It is unclear when the society hall was first built due to conflicting information; County of Maui records indicate that the building was first listed as being built in 1897, though an article from December 1904 by the Maui News lists the building being built and celebrations made upon completion of the society hall on January 14 and 15, 1905.The hall provided a place for Chinese immigrants to visit, socialize (such as playing pai gow), and provide aid.Sometime in 1928, it was noted that the society hall was converted for use as a dormitory by single men, and this use was supposedly practiced up until the 1960s. After the last occupant died, the property was neglected. == Collapse == In September 1988, part of a wall of the building collapsed, smashing adjacent trees, plants, and two clothesline poles in a neighboring property.On April 17, 1996, the derelict wood building collapsed due to damage caused by wood rot, termites, and gravity. Before the collapse, Society Elders had planned to meet to discuss the fate of the building. Certain elements of the building were to have been recovered, and possibly reused in the reconstruction of the building. == Design == The property is 4,544 square feet (422.2 m2) according to Maui County tax records via the Department of Finance\\'s Real Property Division and the NRHP nomination form.The entrance gate comprises two concrete posts and a lintel with Chinese characters on it. Formerly delineated in red, the front facing the street contains incused Chinese characters spelling out Chee Kung Fui Kon (Chinese: 致公會館; Jyutping: zi3 gung1 wui6 gun2), and the back containing the phrase (translated as) Everyone is equal.The main building was a rectangular, two-story structure approximately 55 feet (17 m) by 34 feet (10 m), with covered verandas on both floors. Architectural elements included shingled intersecting gabled roofs with gabled ends and fish-scaled shingles painted in various colors. Assorted other details included a scalloped archway, chamfered posts, decorative wheel and quatrefoil brackets, and an entrance gable with a carved bridgeboard. Diamonds and rectangles were also incorporated into the structure via ornamental lintels and balustrades.A trapezoid cinder block structure approximately 19 feet (5.8 m) by 32 feet (9.8 m) stood next to the building to the east. == Historic listings == The site was placed on the Hawaii State Register of Historic Places on July 30, 1982 and the National Register of Historic Places on November 15, 1982, but delisted in August 1998 from the State register; it is still listed in the NRHP database. == Current condition == Today, the site consists of only a few cement structures and several trees obscuring the front of the property. The gate and adjoining walls, stairs, sidewalks, foundation pillars, and the cinderblock addition lie in decrepit condition. The phrase Everyone is equal is barely discernible behind the lintel on the gate.As of 2010, a property listing sale noted additional details, including the lack of a water meter and possible building restrictions due to it being under the jurisdiction of a redevelopment authority. == Gallery == == References == == Further reading == Bartholomew, Gail, Bailey, Bren (June 1995).

As a child, Ørsted Pedersen played piano, but from the age of 13, he started learning to play upright bass and at the age of 14, while studying, he began his professional jazz career in Denmark with his first band, Jazzkvintet 60 (Danish for Jazz Quintet 60). By the age of fifteen, he had the ability to accompany leading musicians at nightclubs, working regularly at Copenhagen\\'s Jazzhus Montmartre, after his debut there on New Year\\'s Eve 1961, when he was only 15. When seventeen, he had already turned down an offer to join the Count Basie orchestra, mainly because he was too young to get legal permission to live and work as a musician in the United States. The Montmartre was a regular stop-off for touring American Jazz stars, and as a member of the house band, the young Ørsted Pedersen performed with saxophonists such as Sonny Rollins, Dexter Gordon, Rahsaan Roland Kirk and Stan Getz, and pianist Bill Evans, with whom he toured in Europe in 1965. During the 1960s, Pedersen played with a series of other important American jazzmen who were touring or resident in Denmark, including Ben Webster, Brew Moore, Bud Powell, Count Basie, Roy Eldridge, Dizzy Gillespie, Jackie McLean, and vocalist Ella Fitzgerald. He is perhaps best known for his extensive collaboration with Oscar Peterson from 1972 to 1987. His predecessor, Ray Brown, thought highly of the Dane and regarded him as the only upright bassist equal to the task of keeping up with the pianist. He was awarded Best Bass Player of the Year by DownBeat Critics\\' Poll in 1981.Ørsted Pedersen worked in duo and trio arrangements with pianist Kenny Drew, recording over 50 albums together. He also worked with Stéphane Grappelli and Joe Pass and recorded extensively as a leader. His best known songs are \"My Little Anna\", \"Jaywalkin\\'\", and \"The Puzzle\", as well as jazz arrangements of traditional Danish folk songs. A duo performance with Rune Gustafsson at Vossajazz 1980, concluded on the album Just The Way You Are on the label Sonet Gramofon, recorded half a year after this first meeting. He was awarded the Nordic Council Music Prize in 1991. Pedersen had a particular ability to interpret Danish songs and folk melodies. He often played within trio ensembles, partly collectively with the trumpeter Palle Mikkelborg and the keyboard player Kenneth Knudsen, and partly under his own name, usually with guitarists like Philip Catherine and Ulf Wakenius. In 1999, he co-led a duo with pianist Mulgrew Miller, touring Europe, Japan, Australia, and Korea. This format was later enlarged into a trio featuring drummer Alvin Queen. This trio remained intact until Pedersen\\'s death. == Death == Ørsted Pedersen died of heart failure in 2005 at the age of 58 in Copenhagen, Denmark. He was survived by his wife, Solveig, and his three children.Oscar Peterson wrote: == Awards and honors == 1974: Grammy Award.

He lived in the jungle, without contact with civilization, until the age of 17, when he became cacique. In the 1970s he became famous for walking the halls of FUNAI, in Brasilia to fight for land rights of Indians, while carrying a tape recorder, which he used to record everything that was said to him and to prove that the authorities, in most cases, did not keep their word. He was elected to the Chamber of Deputies of Brazil by the Democratic Labour Party from 1983–1987, representing Rio de Janeiro. His election had strong repercussions in Brazil and the world. He was responsible for the creation of a permanent commission for Indians, which brought formal recognition to issues related to Indians. In 1984, he denounced the businessman Calim Eid for having attempted to bribe him to vote for Paulo Maluf, the presidential candidate supported by the military regime then in power. He voted for Tancredo Neves, the democratic opposition candidate. He was not reelected in 1986, but he remained active in politics for several years. With his mandate ended, and abandoned by his tribe, he remained in Brasilia and died on July 18, 2002, due to complications from diabetes. == References == == Further reading == Conklin, Beth A. & Graham, Laura R. 1995. \"The Shifting Middle Ground\".

              " 'The harp is a stringed musical instrument that has a number of individual strings running at an angle to its soundboard; the strings are plucked with the fingers. Harps can be made and played in various ways, standing or sitting, and in orchestras or concerts. Its most common form is triangular in shape and made of wood. Some have multiple rows of strings and pedal attachments. Ancient depictions of harps were recorded in Current-day Iraq (Mesopotamia), Iran (Persia), and Egypt, and later in India and China. By medieval times harps had spread across Europe. Harps were found across the Americas where it was a popular folk tradition in some areas. Distinct designs also emerged from the African continent. Harps have symbolic political traditions and are often used in logos, including in Ireland. == History == Harps have been known since antiquity in Asia, Africa, and Europe, dating back at least as early as 3000 BCE. The instrument had great popularity in Europe during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, where it evolved into a wide range of variants with new technologies, and was disseminated to Europe\\'s colonies, finding particular popularity in Latin America. Although some ancient members of the harp family died out in the Near East and South Asia, descendants of early harps are still played in Myanmar and parts of Africa; other variants defunct in Europe and Asia have been used by folk musicians in the modern era. === Origin === ==== Middle East ==== The earliest harps and lyres were found in Sumer, 3500 BCE, and several harps were excavated from burial pits and royal tombs in Ur. The oldest depictions of harps without a forepillar can be seen adjacent to the Near East, in the wall paintings of ancient Egyptian tombs in the Nile Valley, which date from as early as 3000 BCE. These murals show an instrument that closely resembles the hunter\\'s bow, without the pillar that we find in modern harps. The Chang flourished in Persia in many forms from its introduction, about 4000 BCE, until the 17th century. Around 1900 BCE arched harps in the Iraq-Iran region were replaced by angular harps with vertical or horizontal sound boxes.By the start of the Common Era, \"robust, vertical, angular harps\", which had become predominant in the Hellenistic world, were cherished in the Sasanian court. In the last century of the Sasanian period, angular harps were redesigned to make them as light as possible (\"light, vertical, angular harps\"); while they became more elegant, they lost their structural rigidity. At the height of the Persian tradition of illustrated book production (1300–1600 CE), such light harps were still frequently depicted, although their use as musical instruments was reaching its end. ==== South Asia ==== Mesolithic era paintings from Bhimbetka show harp playing. An arched harp made of wooden brackets and metal strings is depicted on an Indus seal. The works of the Tamil Sangam literature describe the harp and its variants, as early as 200 BCE. Variants were described ranging from 14 to 17 strings, and the instrument used by wandering minstrels for accompaniment. Iconographic evidence of the yaal appears in temple statues dated as early as 600 BCE One of the Sangam works, the Kallaadam recounts how the first yaaḻ harp was inspired by an archer\\'s bow, when he heard the musical sound of its twang.Another early South Asian harp was the ancient veena, not to be confused with the modern Indian veena which is a type of lute. Some Samudragupta gold coins show of the mid-4th century CE show (presumably) the king Samudragupta himself playing the instrument. The ancient veena survives today in Burma, in the form of the saung harp still played there. ==== East Asia ==== The harp was popular in ancient China and neighboring regions, though harps are largely extinct in East Asia in the modern day. The Chinese konghou harp is documented as early as the Spring and Autumn period (770–476 BCE), and became extinct during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644 CE). A similar harp, the Gonghu was played in ancient Korea, documented as early as the Goguryeo period (37 BCE – 686 CE). === Development === ==== Europe ==== While the angle and bow harps held popularity elsewhere, European harps favored the \"pillar\", a third structural member to support the far ends of the arch and soundbox.: 290 A harp with a triangular three-part frame is depicted on 8th-century Pictish stones in Scotland: 290 and in manuscripts (e.g. the Utrecht Psalter) from early 9th-century France. The curve of the harp\\'s neck is a result of the proportional shortening of the basic triangular form to keep the strings equidistant; if the strings were proportionately distant they would be farther apart. As European harps evolved to play more complex music, a key consideration was some way to facilitate the quick changing of a string\\'s pitch to be able to play more chromatic notes. By the Baroque period in Italy and Spain, more strings were added to allow for chromatic notes in more complex harps. In Germany in the second half of the 17th century, diatonic single-row harps were fitted with manually turned hooks that fretted individual strings to raise their pitch by a half step. In the 18th century, a link mechanism was developed connecting these hooks with pedals, leading to the invention of the single-action pedal harp. The first primitive form of pedal harps was developed in the Tyrol region of Austria. Jacob Hochbrucker was the next to design an improved pedal mechanism around 1720, followed in succession by Krumpholtz, Naderman, and the Erard company, who came up with the double mechanism, in which a second row of hooks was installed along the neck, capable of raising the pitch of a string by either one or two half steps. While one course of European harps led to greater complexity, resulting largely in the modern pedal harp, other harping traditions maintained simpler diatonic instruments which survived and evolved into modern traditions. ==== Americas ==== In the Americas, harps are widely but sparsely distributed, except in certain regions where the harp traditions are very strong. Such important centeres include Mexico, the Andean region, Venezuela, and Paraguay. They are derived from the Baroque harps that were brought from Spain during the colonial period. Detailed features vary from place to place. The Paraguayan harp is that country\\'s national instrument, and has gained a worldwide reputation, with international influences alongside folk traditions. They have around 36 strings, are played with fingernails, and with a narrowing spacing and lower tension than modern Western harps, and have a wide and deep soundbox that tapers to the top.The harp is also found in Argentina, though in Uruguay it was largely displaced in religious music by the organ by the end of the 18th century. The harp is historically found in Brazil, but mostly in the south of the country. The Andean harp (Spanish/Quechua: arpa), also known as the Peruvian harp, or indigenous harp, is widespread among peoples living in the highlands of the Andes: Quechua and Aymara, mainly in Peru, and also in Bolivia and Ecuador. It is relatively large, with a significantly increased volume of the resonator box, which gives basses a special richness. It usually accompanies love dances and songs, such as huayno. One of the most famous performers on the Andean harp was Juan Cayambe (Pimampiro Canton, Imbabura Province, Ecuador) Mexican jarocha harp music of Veracruz has also gained some international recognition, evident in the popularity of \"La Bamba\". The arpa jarocha is typically played while standing. In southern Mexico (Chiapas), there is a very different indigenous style of harp music. The harp arrived in Venezuela with Spanish colonists. There are two distinct traditions: the arpa llanera (\\'harp of the Llanos’, or plains) and the arpa central (\\'of the central area\\'). By the 2020s, three types of harps are typically found: the traditional llanera harp, made of Cedar wood and has 32 strings, originally of the gut, but in modern times are of nylon. It is used to accompany both dancers and singers playing joropo music, a traditional form of Venezuelan music, also known as llanera music. the arpa central (also known as arpa mirandina \\'of Miranda State’, and arpa tuyera \\'of the Tuy Valleys’) is strung with wire in the higher register. the Venezuelan electric harp ==== Africa ==== A number of types of harps are found in Africa, predominantly not of the three-sided frame-harp type found in Europe. A number of these, referred to generically as African harps, are bow or angle harps, which lack forepillars joining the neck to the body. A number of harp-like instruments in Africa are not easily classified with European categories. Instruments like the West African kora and Mauritanian ardin are sometimes labeled as \"spike harp\", \"bridge harp\", or harp lute since their construction includes a bridge which holds the strings laterally, vice vertically entering the soundboard. ==== Middle East ==== While lyres and zithers have persisted in the Middle East, most of the true harps of the region have become extinct, though some are undergoing initial revivals. The Turkish çeng was a nine-string harp in the Ottoman Empire which became extinct at the end of the 17th century, but has undergone some revival and evolution since the late 20th century. A similar harp, the changi survives in the Svaneti region of Georgia. ==== South Asia ==== In India, the Bin-Baia harp survives about the Padhar people of Madhya Pradesh. The Kafir harp has been part of Nuristani musical tradition for many years. ==== East Asia ==== The harp largely became extinct in East Asia by the 17th century; around the year 1000, harps like the vajra began to replace prior harps. A few examples survived to the modern era, particularly Myanmar\\'s saung-gauk, which is considered the national instrument in that country. Though the ancient Chinese konghou has not been directly resurrected, the name has been revived and applied to a modern newly invented instrument based on the Western classical harp, but with the strings doubled back to form two notes per string, allowing advanced techniques such as note-bending. == Modern European and American harps == === Concert harp === The concert harp is a technologically advanced instrument, particularly distinguished by its use of \"pedals\", foot-controlled devices which can alter the pitch of given strings, making it fully chromatic and thus able to play a wide body of classical repertoire. The pedal harp contains seven pedals that each affect the tuning of all strings of one pitch-class. The pedals, from left to right, are D, C, B on the left side and E, F, G, A on the right. Pedals were first introduced in 1697 by Jakob Hochbrucker of Bavaria. In 1811 these were upgraded to the \"double action\" pedal system patented by Sébastien Erard. The addition of pedals broadened the harp\\'s abilities, allowing its gradual entry into the classical orchestra, largely beginning in the 19th century. The harp played little or no role in early classical music (being used only a handful of times by major composers such as Mozart and Beethoven), and its usage by Cesar Franck in his Symphony in D minor (1888) was described as \"revolutionary\" despite some body of prior classical usage. In the 20th century, the pedal harp found use outside of classical music, entering musical comedy films in 1929 with Arthur \"Harpo\" Marx, jazz with Casper Reardon in 1934, the Beatles 1967 single \"She\\'s Leaving Home\", and several works by Björk which featured harpist Zeena Parkins. In the early 1980s, Swiss harpist Andreas Vollenweider exposed the concert harp to large new audiences with his popular new age/jazz albums and concert performances. === Folk, lever, and Celtic instruments === In the modern era, there is a family of mid-size harps, generally with nylon strings, and optionally with partial or full levers but without pedals. They range from two to six octaves, and are plucked with the fingers using a similar technique to the pedal harp. Though these harps evoke ties to historical European harps, their specifics are modern, and they are frequently referred to broadly as \"Celtic harps\" due to their region of revival and popular association, or more generically as \"folk harps\" due to their use in non-classical music, or as \"lever harps\" to contrast their modifying mechanism with the larger pedal harp. The modern Celtic harp began to appear in the early 19th century in Ireland, contemporary with the dying-out of earlier forms of Gaelic harp. Dublin pedal harp maker John Egan developed a new type of harp which had gut strings and semitone mechanisms like an orchestral pedal harp; it was small and curved like the historical cláirseach or Irish harp, but its strings were of gut and the soundbox was much lighter. In the 1890s a similar new harp was also developed in Scotland as part of a Gaelic cultural revival. In the mid-20th century Jord Cochevelou developed a variant of the modern Celtic harp which he referred to as the \"Breton Celtic harp\"; his son Alan Stivell was to become the most influential Breton harper, and a strong influence in the broader world of the Celtic harp. === Multi-course harps === A multi-course harp is a harp with more than one row of strings, as opposed to the more common \"single course\" harp. On a double-harp, the two rows generally run parallel to each other, one on either side of the neck, and are usually both diatonic (sometimes with levers) with identical notes. The triple harp originated in Italy in the 16th century, and arrived in Wales in the late 17th century where it established itself in the local tradition as the Welsh harp (telyn deires, \"three-row harp\"). The triple consists of two outer rows of identical diatonic strings with a third set of chromatic strings between them. These strings are off set to permit the harpist to reach past the outer row and pluck an inner string if a chromatic note is needed. === Chromatic-strung harps === Some harps, rather than using pedal or lever devices, achieve chromaticity by simply adding additional strings to cover the notes outside their diatonic home scale. The Welsh triple harp is one such instrument, and two other instruments employing this technique are the cross-strung harp and the inline chromatic harp. The cross-strung harp has one row of diatonic strings, and a separate row of chromatic notes, angled in an \"X\" shape so that the row which can be played by the right hand at the top may be played by the left hand at the bottom, and vice versa. This variant was first attested as the arpa de dos órdenes (\"two-row harp\") in Spain and Portugal, in the 17th century.The inline chromatic harp is generally a single-course harp with all 12 notes of the chromatic scale appearing in a single row. Single course inline chromatic harps have been produced at least since 1902, when Karl Weigel of Hanover patented a model of inline chromatic harp. === Electric harps === Amplified (electro-acoustic) hollow body and solid body electric lever harps are produced by many harp makers, including Lyon & Healy, Salvi, and Camac. They generally use individual piezo-electric sensors for each string, often in combination with small internal microphones to produce a mixed electrical signal. Hollow body instruments can also be played acoustically, while solid body instruments must be amplified. The late-20th century Gravikord is a modern purpose-built electric double harp made of stainless steel based on the traditional West African kora. == Variations == Harps vary globally in many ways. In terms of size, many smaller harps can be played on the lap, whereas larger harps are quite heavy and rest on the floor. Different harps may use strings of catgut, nylon, metal, or some combination. All harps have a neck, resonator, and strings, frame harps or triangular harps have a pillar at their long end to support the strings, while open harps, such as arch harps and bow harps, do not. Modern harps also vary in techniques used to extend the range and chromaticism of the strings (e.g., adding sharps and flats). On lever harps one adjusts a string\\'s note mid-performance by flipping a lever, which shortens the string enough to raise the pitch by a chromatic sharp. On pedal harps depressing the pedal one step turns geared levers on the strings for all octaves of a single pitch; most allow a second step that turns a second set of levers. The pedal harp is a standard instrument in the orchestra of the Romantic music era (ca. 1800–1910 CE) and the 20th and 21st century music era. == Structure and mechanism == Harps are essentially triangular and made primarily of wood. Strings are made of gut or wire, often replaced in the modern day by nylon or metal. The top end of each string is secured on the crossbar or neck, where each will have a tuning peg or similar device to adjust the pitch. From the crossbar, the string runs down to the sounding board on the resonating body, where it is secured with a knot; on modern harps the string\\'s hole is protected with an eyelet to limit wear on the wood. The distance between the tuning peg and the soundboard, as well as tension and weight of the string, determine the pitch of the string. The body is hollow, and when a taut string is plucked, the body resonates, projecting sound. The longest side of the harp is called the column or pillar (though some earlier harps, such as a \"bow harp\", lack a pillar). On most harps the sole purpose of the pillar is to hold up the neck against the great strain of the strings. On harps which have pedals (largely the modern concert harp), the pillar is a hollow column and encloses the rods which adjust the pitches, which are levered by pressing pedals at the base of the instrument. On harps of earlier design, a single string produces only a single pitch unless it is retuned. In many cases this means such a harp can only play in one key at a time and must be retuned to play in another key. Harpers and luthiers have developed various remedies to this limitation: the addition of extra strings to cover chromatic notes (sometimes in separate or angled rows distinct from the main row of strings), addition of small levers on the crossbar which when actuated raise the pitch of a string by a set interval (usually a semitone), or use of pedals at the base of the instrument, pressed with the foot, which move additional small pegs on the crossbar. The small pegs gently contact the string near the tuning peg, changing the vibrating length, but not the tension, and hence the pitch of the string.These solutions increase the versatility of a harp at the cost of adding complexity, weight, and expense. == Terminology and etymology == The modern English word harp comes from the Old English hearpe; akin to Old High German harpha. A person who plays a pedal harp is called a \"harpist\"; a person who plays a folk-harp is called a \"harper\" or sometimes a \"harpist\"; either may be called a \"harp-player\", and the distinctions are not strict. A number of instruments that are not harps are none-the-less colloquially referred to as \"harps\". Chordophones like the aeolian harp (wind harp), the autoharp, the psaltery, as well as the piano and harpsichord, are not harps, but zithers, because their strings are parallel to their soundboard. Harps\\' strings rise approximately perpendicularly from the soundboard. Similarly, the many varieties of harp guitar and harp lute, while chordophones, belong to the lute family and are not true harps. All forms of the lyre and kithara are also not harps, but belong to the fourth family of ancient instruments under the chordophones, the lyres, closely related to the zither family. The term \"harp\" has also been applied to many instruments which are not even chordophones. The vibraphone was (and is still) sometimes referred to as the \"vibraharp\", though it has no strings and its sound is produced by striking metal bars. In blues music, the harmonica is often casually referred to as a \"blues harp\" or \"harp\", but it is a free reed wind instrument, not a stringed instrument, and is therefore not a true harp. The Jew\\'s harp is neither Jewish nor a harp; it is a plucked idiophone and likewise not a stringed instrument. The laser harp is not a stringed instrument at all, but is a harp-shaped electronic instrument controller that has laser beams where harps have strings. == As a symbol == === Political === ==== Ireland ==== The harp has been used as a political symbol of Ireland for centuries. Its origin is unknown but from the evidence of the ancient oral and written literature, it has been present in one form or another since at least the 6th century or before. According to tradition, Brian Boru, High King of Ireland (died at the Battle of Clontarf, 1014) played the harp, as did many of the gentry in the country during the period of the Gaelic Lordship of Ireland (ended c. 1607 with the Flight of the Earls following the Elizabethan Wars).In traditional Gaelic society every clan and chief of any consequence would have a resident harp player who would compose eulogies and elegies (later known as \"planxties\") in honour of the leader and chief men of the clan. The harp was adopted as a symbol of the Kingdom of Ireland on the coinage from 1542, and in the Royal Standard of King James VI and I in 1603 and continued to feature on all English and United Kingdom Royal Standards ever since, though the styles of the harps depicted differed in some respects. It was also used on the Commonwealth Jack of Oliver Cromwell, issued in 1649 and on the Protectorate Jack issued in 1658 as well as on the Lord Protector\\'s Standard issued on the succession of Richard Cromwell in 1658. The harp is also traditionally used on the flag of Leinster. Since 1922, the government of Ireland has used a similar left-facing harp, based on the Trinity College Harp in the Library of Trinity College Dublin as its state symbol. This design first appeared on the Great Seal of the Irish Free State, which in turn was replaced by the coat of arms, the Irish Presidential Standard and the Presidential Seal in the 1937 Constitution of Ireland. The harp emblem is used on official state seals and documents including the Irish passport and has appeared on Irish coinage from the Middle Ages to the current Irish imprints of euro coins. ==== Elsewhere ==== The South Asian Tamil harp yaal is the symbol of City of Jaffna, Sri Lanka, whose legendary root originates from a harp player.The arms of the Finnish city of Kangasala features a red, eagle-headed harp. === Religious === In the context of Christianity, heaven is sometimes symbolically depicted as populated by angels playing harps, giving the instrument associations of the sacred and heavenly. In the Bible, Genesis 4:21 says that Jubal, the first musician and son of Lamech, was \\'the father of all who play\\' the harp and flute.Many depictions of King David in Jewish art have him holding or playing a harp, such as a sculpture outside King David\\'s tomb in Jerusalem.\"King David statue at King David\\'s tomb\". Jerusalem.com. photo gallery. Jerusalem. === Corporate === The harp is also used extensively as a corporate logo, predominantly by companies that have, or wish to suggest, a connection with Ireland. The Irish brewer Guinness has used a right-facing harp (in contrast to the Irish State emblem’s left-facing version) as its emblem since 1759, the Harp Lager brand has done so since 1960. The Irish Independent newspaper has used a harp in its masthead since 1961. The Irish airline Ryanair, founded in 1985, also features a stylised harp in its logo. Other organisations in Ireland use the harp in their corporate identity, but not always prominently; these include the National University of Ireland and the associated University College Dublin, and the Gaelic Athletic Association. In Northern Ireland, the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Queen\\'s University of Belfast use the harp as part of their identity. === Sporting === In sport, the harp is used in the emblems of the League of Ireland football team Finn Harps F.C., Donegal\\'s senior soccer club. Outside of Ireland, it appears in the badge of the Scottish Premiership team Hibernian F.C. - a team originally founded by Irish emigrants. Not all sporting uses of the harp are references to Ireland, however: the Iraqi football club Al-Shorta has used a harp as its emblem since the early 1990s, after they gained the nickname Al-Qithara (Assyrian Neo-Aramaic: \"the harp\") when their style of play was likened to fine harp-playing by a television presenter. == See also == List of compositions for harp List of harpists Category:Harpists === Types of harp === Celtic harp, or Clàrsach, a modern replica of Medieval north European harps Claviharp, a 19th century instrument that combined a harp with a keyboard Epigonion, a 40 stringed instrument in ancient Greece thought to have been a harp Kantele, a traditional Finnish and Karelian zyther-like instrument Konghou, name shared by an ancient Chinese harp and a modern re-adaption Kora, a west-African folk-instrument, intermediate between a harp and a lute Lyre, kithara, zyther-like instruments used in Greek classical antiquity and later Pedal harp, the modern, chromatic concert harp Psaltery, a small, flat, lap instrument in the zither family Triple harp, a chromatic multi-course harp traditional in Wales == References == == Sources == Gaisford, Thomas (1848).

              " '\"In dir ist Freude\" (In You Is Joy) is a German hymn with text attributed to Cyriacus Schneegaß, written to a 1591 dance song melody by Giovanni Giacomo Gastoldi. It was first published in a collection of Christmas carols in Erfurt in 1594, and then published again in 1598. Johann Sebastian Bach composed a chorale prelude, BWV 615, as part of his Orgelbüchlein. The song is part of the common Protestant hymnal Evangelisches Gesangbuch, and of many hymnals and songbooks, including ecumenical collections. It was translated by Catherine Winkworth as \"In Thee Is Gladness\". == History == The text of \"In dir ist Freude\" is written to a secular melody. The tune by Giovanni Giacomo Gastoldi was first published in 1591, for an Italian dancing song, \"A lieta vita amor ci invita\" (Amor invites to a merry life) that has elements of song for entertainment. The text and melody of \"In dir ist Freude\" first appeared in Erfurt in Johann Lindemann\\'s 1594 collection of 20 Christmas carols. Lindemann published them in Erfurt in 1598. While the text was first attributed to Lindemann, it is unclear if he wrote any hymns, and it became later rather attributed to Cyriacus Schneegaß.It is contained in the modern Protestant hymnal Evangelisches Gesangbuch as EG 389, and is part of many hymnals and songbooks, including ecumenical collections. == Text == The text is in two stanzas of 16 short lines. Most lines have five syllables in always the same rhythm. Lines 3, 6, 11 and 16 are longer and rhyme, in an AAB CCB DDEEF GGHHF rhyme scheme. Lines 11 and 16 of each stanza end on \"Halleluja\". The text is based on Bible verses including Psalm 30:11–12 and Romans 8:38–39. The singer addresses Jesus as the source of joy in all distress.The hymn was translated by Catherine Winkworth as \"In Thee Is Gladness\" for the second edition of her Lyra Germanica (1858).

In a fashionable country house near Paris, the Pavillon du Butard in La Celle-Saint-Cloud, belonging to the National Assembly, a group of girls aged 15 to 17 performed \"ballets\" attended by prominent figures of the political and social worlds, notably, André Le Troquer, at the time president of the National Assembly. The performances were alleged to have ended in orgies.The scandal came to light when four mothers of the girls became suspicious. 23 people were charged in relation to the ballets roses, including Le Troquer, who was charged with \"offences against morality\", as well as actress Elisabeth Pinajeff. 22, including Le Troquer and Pinajeff, were found guilty and sentenced in court. == References == == Bibliography == Manheim, Ralph Nord by Louis-Ferdinand Céline ISBN 1-56478-142-9, p. 441',\n",

              " 'Liberty is the ability to do as one pleases, or a right or immunity enjoyed by prescription or by grant (i.e. privilege). It is a synonym for the word freedom. In modern politics, liberty is understood as the state of being free within society from control or oppressive restrictions imposed by authority on one\\'s way of life, behavior, or political views. In theology, liberty is freedom from the effects of \"sin, spiritual servitude, [or] worldly ties\".Sometimes liberty is differentiated from freedom by using the word \"freedom\" primarily, if not exclusively, to mean the ability to do as one wills and what one has the power to do; and using the word \"liberty\" to mean the absence of arbitrary restraints, taking into account the rights of all involved. In this sense, the exercise of liberty is subject to capability and limited by the rights of others. Thus liberty entails the responsible use of freedom under the rule of law without depriving anyone else of their freedom. Liberty can be taken away as a form of punishment. In many countries, people can be deprived of their liberty if they are convicted of criminal acts. Liberty originates from the Latin word libertas, derived from the name of the goddess Libertas, who, along with more modern personifications, is often used to portray the concept, and the archaic Roman god Liber. The word \"liberty\" is often used in slogans, such as in \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\" and \"Liberté, égalité, fraternité\". == Philosophy == Philosophers from the earliest times have considered the question of liberty. Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius (121–180 AD) wrote: a polity in which there is the same law for all, a polity administered with regard to equal rights and equal freedom of speech, and the idea of a kingly government which respects most of all the freedom of the governed. According to compatibilist Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679): a free man is he that in those things which by his strength and wit he is able to do is not hindered to do what he hath the will to do. John Locke (1632–1704) rejected that definition of liberty. While not specifically mentioning Hobbes, he attacks Sir Robert Filmer who had the same definition. According to Locke: In the state of nature, liberty consists of being free from any superior power on Earth. People are not under the will or lawmaking authority of others but have only the law of nature for their rule. In political society, liberty consists of being under no other lawmaking power except that established by consent in the commonwealth. People are free from the dominion of any will or legal restraint apart from that enacted by their own constituted lawmaking power according to the trust put in it. Thus, freedom is not as Sir Robert Filmer defines it: \\'A liberty for everyone to do what he likes, to live as he pleases, and not to be tied by any laws.\\' Freedom is constrained by laws in both the state of nature and political society. Freedom of nature is to be under no other restraint but the law of nature. Freedom of people under government is to be under no restraint apart from standing rules to live by that are common to everyone in the society and made by the lawmaking power established in it. Persons have a right or liberty to (1) follow their own will in all things that the law has not prohibited and (2) not be subject to the inconstant, uncertain, unknown, and arbitrary wills of others. John Stuart Mill (1806–1873), in his work, On Liberty, was the first to recognize the difference between liberty as the freedom to act and liberty as the absence of coercion.In his book Two Concepts of Liberty, Isaiah Berlin formally framed the differences between two perspectives as the distinction between two opposite concepts of liberty: positive liberty and negative liberty. The latter designates a negative condition in which an individual is protected from tyranny and the arbitrary exercise of authority, while the former refers to the liberty that comes from self-mastery, the freedom from inner compulsions such as weakness and fear. == Politics == === History === The modern concept of political liberty has its origins in the Greek concepts of freedom and slavery. To be free, to the Greeks, was not to have a master, to be independent from a master (to live as one likes). That was the original Greek concept of freedom. It is closely linked with the concept of democracy, as Aristotle put it: \"This, then, is one note of liberty which all democrats affirm to be the principle of their state. Another is that a man should live as he likes. This, they say, is the privilege of a freeman, since, on the other hand, not to live as a man likes is the mark of a slave. This is the second characteristic of democracy, whence has arisen the claim of men to be ruled by none, if possible, or, if this is impossible, to rule and be ruled in turns; and so it contributes to the freedom based upon equality.\"This applied only to free men. In Athens, for instance, women could not vote or hold office and were legally and socially dependent on a male relative.The populations of the Persian Empire enjoyed some degree of freedom. Citizens of all religions and ethnic groups were given the same rights and had the same freedom of religion, women had the same rights as men, and slavery was abolished (550 BC). All the palaces of the kings of Persia were built by paid workers in an era when slaves typically did such work.In the Maurya Empire of ancient India, citizens of all religions and ethnic groups had some rights to freedom, tolerance, and equality. The need for tolerance on an egalitarian basis can be found in the Edicts of Ashoka the Great, which emphasize the importance of tolerance in public policy by the government. The slaughter or capture of prisoners of war also appears to have been condemned by Ashoka. Slavery also appears to have been non-existent in the Maurya Empire. However, according to Hermann Kulke and Dietmar Rothermund, \"Ashoka\\'s orders seem to have been resisted right from the beginning.\"Roman law also embraced certain limited forms of liberty, even under the rule of the Roman Emperors. However, these liberties were accorded only to Roman citizens. Many of the liberties enjoyed under Roman law endured through the Middle Ages, but were enjoyed solely by the nobility, rarely by the common man. The idea of inalienable and universal liberties had to wait until the Age of Enlightenment. === Social contract === The social contract theory, most influentially formulated by Hobbes, John Locke and Rousseau (though first suggested by Plato in The Republic), was among the first to provide a political classification of rights, in particular through the notion of sovereignty and of natural rights. The thinkers of the Enlightenment reasoned that law governed both heavenly and human affairs, and that law gave the king his power, rather than the king\\'s power giving force to law. This conception of law would find its culmination in the ideas of Montesquieu. The conception of law as a relationship between individuals, rather than families, came to the fore, and with it the increasing focus on individual liberty as a fundamental reality, given by \"Nature and Nature\\'s God,\" which, in the ideal state, would be as universal as possible. In On Liberty, John Stuart Mill sought to define the \"...nature and limits of the power which can be legitimately exercised by society over the individual,\" and as such, he describes an inherent and continuous antagonism between liberty and authority and thus, the prevailing question becomes \"how to make the fitting adjustment between individual independence and social control\". == Origins of political freedom == === England and Great Britain === Timeline: 1066 – as a condition of his coronation William the Conqueror assented to the London Charter of Liberties which guaranteed the \"Saxon\" liberties of the City of London. 1100 – the Charter of Liberties is passed which sets out certain liberties of nobles, church officials and individuals. 1166 – Henry II of England transformed English law by passing the Assize of Clarendon. The act, a forerunner to trial by jury, started the abolition of trial by combat and trial by ordeal. 1187-1189 – publication of Tractatus de legibus et consuetudinibus regni Anglie which contains authoritative definitions of freedom and servitude. 1215 – Magna Carta was enacted, becoming the cornerstone of liberty in first England, then Great Britain, and later the world. 1628 – the English Parliament passed the Petition of Right which set out specific liberties of English subjects. 1679 – the English Parliament passed the Habeas Corpus Act which outlawed unlawful or arbitrary imprisonment. 1689 – the Bill of Rights granted \"freedom of speech in Parliament\", and reinforced many existing civil rights in England. The Scots law equivalent the Claim of Right is also passed. 1772 – the Somerset v Stewart judgement found that slavery was unsupported by common law in England and Wales. 1859 – an essay by the philosopher John Stuart Mill, entitled On Liberty, argued for toleration and individuality. \"If any opinion is compelled to silence, that opinion may, for aught we can certainly know, be true. To deny this is to assume our own infallibility.\" 1948 – British representatives attempted to but were prevented from adding a legal framework to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. (It was not until 1976 that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights came into force, giving a legal status to most of the Declaration.) 1958 – Two Concepts of Liberty, by Isaiah Berlin, identified \"negative liberty\" as an obstacle, as distinct from \"positive liberty\" which promotes self-mastery and the concepts of freedom. === United States === According to the 1776 United States Declaration of Independence, all people have a natural right to \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\". But this declaration of liberty was troubled from the outset by the institutionalization of legalized Black slavery. Slave owners argued that their liberty was paramount since it involved property, their slaves, and that Blacks had no rights that any White man was obliged to recognize. The Supreme Court, in the Dred Scott decision, upheld this principle. It was not until 1866, following the Civil War, that the US Constitution was amended to extend limited rights to persons of color, and not until 1920 that voting rights were extended to women.By the later half of the 20th century, liberty was expanded further to prohibit government interference with personal choices. In the United States Supreme Court decision Griswold v. Connecticut, Justice William O. Douglas argued that liberties relating to personal relationships, such as marriage, have a unique primacy of place in the hierarchy of freedoms. Jacob M. Appel has summarized this principle: I am grateful that I have rights in the proverbial public square – but, as a practical matter, my most cherished rights are those that I possess in my bedroom and hospital room and death chamber. Most people are far more concerned that they can control their own bodies than they are about petitioning Congress. In modern America, various competing ideologies have divergent views about how best to promote liberty. Liberals in the original sense of the word see equality as a necessary component of freedom. Progressives stress freedom from business monopoly as essential. Right-wing libertarians disagree, and see economic and individual freedom as best. The Tea Party movement sees the \"big government\" as the enemy of freedom. Other major participants in the modern American right-wing libertarian movement include the Libertarian Party, the Free State Project, and the Mises Institute. === France === France supported the Americans in their revolt against English rule and, in 1789, overthrew their own monarchy, with the cry of \"Liberté, égalité, fraternité\". The bloodbath that followed, known as the reign of terror, soured many people on the idea of liberty. Edmund Burke, considered one of the fathers of conservatism, wrote \"The French had shewn themselves the ablest architects of ruin that had hitherto existed in the world.\" == Ideologies == === Liberalism === According to the Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics, liberalism is \"the belief that it is the aim of politics to preserve individual rights and to maximize freedom of choice\". But they point out that there is considerable discussion about how to achieve those goals. Every discussion of freedom depends on three key components: who is free, what they are free to do, and what forces restrict their freedom. John Gray argues that the core belief of liberalism is toleration. Liberals allow others freedom to do what they want, in exchange for having the same freedom in return. This idea of freedom is personal rather than political. William Safire points out that liberalism is attacked by both the Right and the Left: by the Right for defending such practices as abortion, homosexuality, and atheism, and by the Left for defending free enterprise and the rights of the individual over the collective. === Libertarianism === According to the Encyclopædia Britannica, libertarians hold liberty as their primary political value. Their approach to implementing liberty involves opposing any governmental coercion, aside from that which is necessary to prevent individuals from coercing each other.Libertarianism is guided by the principle commonly known as the Non-Aggression Principle (NAP). The Non-Aggression Principle asserts that aggression against an individual or an individual\\'s property is always an immoral violation of one\\'s life, liberty, and property rights. Utilizing deceit instead of consent to achieve ends is also a violation of the Non-Aggression principle. Therefore, under the framework of the Non-Aggression principle, rape, murder, deception, involuntary taxation, government regulation, and other behaviors that initiate aggression against otherwise peaceful individuals are considered violations of this principle. This principle is most commonly adhered to by libertarians. A common elevator pitch for this principle is, \"Good ideas don\\'t require force.\" === Republican liberty === According to republican theorists of freedom, like the historian Quentin Skinner or the philosopher Philip Pettit, one\\'s liberty should not be viewed as the absence of interference in one\\'s actions, but as non-domination. According to this view, which originates in the Roman Digest, to be a liber homo, a free man, means not being subject to another\\'s arbitrary will, that is to say, dominated by another. They also cite Machiavelli who asserted that you must be a member of a free self-governing civil association, a republic, if you are to enjoy individual liberty.The predominance of this view of liberty among parliamentarians during the English Civil War resulted in the creation of the liberal concept of freedom as non-interference in Thomas Hobbes\\' Leviathan. === Socialism === Socialists view freedom as a concrete situation as opposed to a purely abstract ideal. Freedom is a state of being where individuals have agency to pursue their creative interests unhindered by coercive social relationships, specifically those they are forced to engage in as a requisite for survival under a given social system. Freedom thus requires both the material economic conditions that make freedom possible alongside social relationships and institutions conducive to freedom.The socialist conception of freedom is closely related to the socialist view of creativity and individuality. Influenced by Karl Marx\\'s concept of alienated labor, socialists understand freedom to be the ability for an individual to engage in creative work in the absence of alienation, where \"alienated labor\" refers to work people are forced to perform and un-alienated work refers to individuals pursuing their own creative interests. ==== Marxism ==== For Karl Marx, meaningful freedom is only attainable in a communist society characterized by superabundance and free access. Such a social arrangement would eliminate the need for alienated labor and enable individuals to pursue their own creative interests, leaving them to develop and maximize their full potentialities. This goes alongside Marx\\'s emphasis on the ability of socialism and communism progressively reducing the average length of the workday to expand the \"realm of freedom\", or discretionary free time, for each person. Marx\\'s notion of communist society and human freedom is thus radically individualistic. === Anarchism === While many anarchists see freedom slightly differently, all oppose authority, including the authority of the state, of capitalism, and of nationalism. For the Russian revolutionary anarchist Mikhail Bakunin, liberty did not mean an abstract ideal but a concrete reality based on the equal liberty of others. In a positive sense, liberty consists of \"the fullest development of all the faculties and powers of every human being, by education, by scientific training, and by material prosperity.\" Such a conception of liberty is \"eminently social, because it can only be realized in society,\" not in isolation. In a negative sense, liberty is \"the revolt of the individual against all divine, collective, and individual authority.\" == Historical writings on liberty == John Locke (1689).

              " 'Bagh District (Urdu: ضلع باغ) is one of the ten districts of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan. Previously part of Poonch District, it was established as a separate district in 1988.The Bagh District is bounded on the north by the Muzaffarabad District, the Hattian Bala District, and the Baramulla District of Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir, on the east by the Haveli District, on the south by the Poonch District, and on the west by the Rawalpindi District of Pakistan\\'s Punjab Province. The total area of the district is 770 square kilometers. The Bagh District is linked to the Muzaffarabad District by two roads, one via Sudhan Gali (80 km) and the other via Kohala (97 km). The district headquarters is the city of Bagh, which is situated 46 km from Rawalakot. It is said that a bagh (garden) was set up by a landowner where the premises of the Forest Department are now located. As a result, the area that is now the district headquarters was named \"Bagh\". == History == There is an archaeological site in the Bagh District called Bagh Fort.Prior to 1947, Bagh was a tehsil in the Poonch District of Jammu and Kashmir. == Administrative divisions == The district of Bagh is subdivided into 5 tehsils: Bagh Tehsil Dhirkot Tehsil Hari Ghel Tehsil Rera Tehsil Birpani Tehsil == Geography == Topographically, the entire Bagh District is a mountainous area, generally sloping from north-east to south-west. The area is part of the Lesser Himalayas zone. The main mountain range in the district is the Pir Panjal. The Haji-Pir Pass is situated at a height of 3421 meters above sea level. The general elevation is between 1500 and 2500 meters above sea level. The mountains are generally covered with coniferous forests. The main river in the district is the Mahl Nala, but numerous other rivulets also flow in the district. == Climate == The climate of the district varies with altitude. The temperature generally remains between 2 °C and 40 °C. The main eastern part of the district is very cold in the winter and moderate in the summer. However, the lower valleys, the localities bordering Bagh at Kohala and its adjoining areas (Mongbajri and Ajra-Bagh) remain cold in the winter and hot in the summer. May, June, and July are the hottest months. The maximum and minimum temperatures during the month of June are about 40 °C and 22 °C, respectively. December, January, and February are the coldest months. The maximum temperature in January is about 16 °C, and the minimum temperature is 3 °C. Annual rainfall is about 1,500 millimetres (59 in). == Demography == The total population of the district according to the 2017 census is 371,919.The main language of the district is Pahari, which is estimated to be native to around 95% of the inhabitants. The Pahari dialect spoken in Bagh is closely related to the dialect spoken to the north in the Muzaffarabad (84% shared basic vocabulary) and to the core Pahari varieties spoken to the south-west in the Galyat region around Murree (86–88%). There are also small groups of speakers of Gujari and Kashmiri. == Education == According to the Pakistan District Education Ranking 2017, a report by Alif Ailaan, the Bagh District is ranked at number 5 nationally in the ranking related to education, with an education score of 73.99. The learning score is at 85.42, with a gender parity score of 88.32.The school infrastructure score of the Bagh District is 28.32, giving Bagh a national rank of 126. School infrastructure is a major problem in all of Azad Kashmir. Access to schools, with schools being far away, is the primary reason why there are fewer enrollments after the completion of primary school. == 2005 earthquake == The city of Bagh, like other areas of the district, was heavily damaged in the 2005 Kashmir earthquake. Sixty percent of the buildings collapsed. Thousands of people died, and many more found themselves homeless. In the aftermath of the earthquake, NATO sent specialists to the district to help with clearing and reconstruction. There was a report that an entire village in the district had been wiped out. The United States government, through Pakistan, distributed vouchers to people in the district so that they could buy food and water. == References == == External links == Bagh Azad Jammu and Kashmir Official Portal District Profile – Bagh Earthquake Reconstruction & Rehabilitation Authority (ERRA) 2007',\n",

              " 'Broadway station is a Caltrain station in Burlingame, California. Caltrain only serves the stop on weekends and holidays; weekday service is provided by a bus shuttle to nearby Millbrae station. == History == A station in north Burlingame was opened around 1911, and renamed to Buri Buri in 1917, then Broadway in 1926. The former Southern Pacific Railroad depot building at Broadway still stands and used as a restaurant. A lightly-used station at nearby Easton (which existed as a separate town from 1906 to 1910) was in service until at least 1925. The San Francisco Municipal Railway 40 San Mateo interurban, originally operated by United Railroads of San Francisco, served passengers at the station from their line on what became California Drive: 32 until the service ceased in 1949. Like most stations on the corridor, the Southern Pacific built Broadway with a side platform on the west track for southbound trains, and a narrow island platform between the tracks for northbound trains. Because of the narrow center platform for northbound passengers, a hold-out rule is in effect at the station: if a train is stopped for passengers, an approaching train in the opposite direction on the other track must wait outside the station. The resulting delays were the main reason that Broadway became a weekend-only station on August 1, 2005, shortly after the Caltrain Express project was completed. A free shuttle to Millbrae station was implemented in lieu of weekday service. === Future plans === After the electrification of Caltrain is completed, daily service is planned to be reinstated at Broadway. The nearby level grade crossing at Broadway Avenue is planned to be grade-separated, with construction projected to start as early as 2025 if funding can be identified. The at-grade crossing has been identified as the second-most necessary grade separation among 10,000 at-grade crossings in California because it handles 70,000 vehicles per day, and city officials state it is the site of the worst traffic congestion in Burlingame. Grade separation is projected to cost $250 million. Plans for a grade separation started in 1965 when the Peninsula Commute was being operated by the Southern Pacific Railroad, but were stymied by the complex geometry of Broadway, which intersects with roads immediately east (Carolan) and west (California) of the level crossing, and (further east) passes over U.S. 101 at an interchange rebuilt in 2017, and the heavy rail traffic, projected at more than 114 trains per day by 2020. Traffic through the actual grade crossing was estimated at 27,000 vehicles per day in 2015.: 1–2 There are an average of two accidents and 105 traffic citations issued each year resulting from traffic stopped on the tracks.Seven alternatives (including a no-build option preserving the current layout) were studied in the Broadway Grade Separation Project Study Report, which recommended Alternative A, a combination of partially elevating the rail line for 7,300 feet (2,200 m) and partially depressing the roadway for a length of 730 feet (220 m), resulting in acceptable grades of up to 4.8 percent for road traffic and 0.75 percent for rail traffic.: 12–14 Under Alternative A, shoofly tracks would first be constructed east of the existing line and west of Carolan, then rail traffic would be diverted while the existing line was elevated. After the new rail bridge and embankments were completed, rail traffic would shift back to the newly elevated original alignment and Broadway would be temporarily closed while being reconstructed at a depressed alignment.: 15–16 Alternatives with the rail line lowered were considered, but they were rejected because of the high cost of drainage due to three nearby creeks.: 21 Broadway station would be rebuilt with an island platform to remove the existing hold-out rule. A preliminary design for the grade separation and station rebuild was anticipated for Spring 2019, and ultimately completed in October 2020 along with environmental clearance. The project is forecast to finish construction by summer of 2027. == References == == External links == Caltrain - Broadway Broadway Grade Separation (City of Burlingame) Burlingame Broadway Grade Separation Project (Caltrain)',\n",
              " 'Jack of Hearts (Jack Hart) is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character first appeared in The Deadly Hands of Kung Fu #22 (March 1976), and was created by writer Bill Mantlo and artist Keith Giffen. He starred in his own four-issue mini series and has been a regular character in the Iron Man comics as well as at one point being a regular in The Avengers comic book. Jack of Hearts, real name Jack Hart, is the son of scientist Philip Hart (creator of \"Zero Fluid\") and an alien woman from the Contraxian race. As a young man Jack was doused in Zero Fluid and gained super powers but was not in total control of his powers. In an attempt to control his powers, Jack of Hearts built a containment suit that resembled the Jack of Hearts playing card. The lack of control became a recurring theme with Jack of Hearts, including his stint in the Avengers where he had to spend 14 hours a day in a containment room to prevent self-destruction. When his powers became uncontrollable he chose to leave Earth, exploding in space without harming any innocent bystanders. The return of Jack of Hearts and the explosion that killed Scott Lang was the launching point of the 2004-05 \"Avengers Disassembled\". The character was resurrected as part of one of the Marvel Zombies mini-series where Zero Energy reforms into Jack of Hearts, bringing the character back to life. The Zombies were later defeated with the help of Jack of Hearts. == Publication history == Jack of Hearts first appeared in the black & white magazine The Deadly Hands of Kung Fu #22 (March 1976), and was created by writer Bill Mantlo and illustrator Keith Giffen. He was presented as an antagonist for the superhero White Tiger but his origin story in the following issue established him as a hero. His debut appearance in a color comic book was in The Incredible Hulk vol. 2 #214 (Aug. 1977) where he fights the Hulk. He later serves a brief stint as an ally and apprentice of Iron Man, becoming a regular cast member of the series during Mantlo\\'s tenure as writer. Jack has made various guest appearances in several books over the years, including Marvel Two-In-One, The Defenders, Marvel Premiere, (in a solo story meant to launch the character in his own series) ROM, and Marvel Team-Up, (which served as an intro to his 1984 mini-series) among others. He starred in his own self-titled, four issue limited series from Jan. to April 1984.He was later made a regular in The Avengers by writer Kurt Busiek, who explained, \"I first ran into Jack in The Deadly Hands of Kung Fu in an issue drawn by Gil Kane and Rico Rival. That great overcomplicated costume and the energy that Gil put into the storytelling hooked me, and I’ve been a fan ever since\". == Fictional character biography == === Early life === Jack Hart was born in New Haven, Connecticut. He is the son of Philip Hart, a scientist who created an energy source called \"zero fluid\", and Marie, an alien humanoid woman of the Contraxian race. After being exposed to a vat of zero fluid, Jack underwent a mutagenic change and gained the ability to project concussive energy from his body. After gaining these powers, Jack began his mission of vengeance against the Corporation that killed his father. This led to Jack fighting other superheroes such as the Sons of the Tiger and the Hulk. He also fought the White Tiger. Eventually, he killed Stryke, his father\\'s killer.Later, Jack mistakenly fought Iron Man. Being new to super-heroics, he asked Iron Man to take him on as an apprentice, which he did, to show him the ropes. Jack teamed with Iron Man, Nick Fury, Guardsman, Jasper Sitwell, Jean DeWolff, and the Wraith, and battled Midas. Jack was briefly turned to a golden living statue by Midas, and then freed from this golden state by Iron Man and Yellowjacket. Jack then aided Iron Man in fighting the Soviet Super-Soldiers on the moon. Jack aided Iron Man against the Rigellian Commander Arcturus. Jack later went off on his own, and fought Hemlock. === Being a Hero === Later, Jack moved past his mission of blind vengeance and became a true hero, working with various other superheroes such as the Defenders. Jack fought the Thing, who was under mental control of the Machinesmith. Jack Hart was then reunited with a college girlfriend named Marcy Kane (who was also a fellow graduate student of Peter Parker, a.k.a. Spider-Man). Marcy, a scientist, and S.H.I.E.L.D. offered to help find a cure for Jack\\'s dangerous super powers. Jack fought some S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, and his powers were temporarily dampened by Spider-Man. Marcy turned out to be a Contraxian agent sent to Earth to find Jack. It was at this time Jack learned of his half-Contraxian heritage. Marcy took Jack to Contraxia, where he discovered that his powers had become much stronger, and saved the home-world of his mother by reenergizing its dying sun. The Contraxians could not find a solution for Jack\\'s unstable powers, and he left Contraxia to wander outer space in exile.While wandering space he was captured by the Stranger. He later escaped captivity on the Stranger\\'s planet. Jack fought Quasar during his return to Earth; however, Jack exploded when his containment suit was breached in battle with the Presence. Jack was retrieved from space, revived and mentally controlled by Moondragon, and he attacked Kismet. The damage to his armor led Jack to seek aid from the Silver Surfer, who found an alien armorer on Anvil who designed a new containment suit for Jack. Jack then battled Nebula and Geatar. Shortly after this adventure, Jack fell in love with the alien warrior woman known as Ganymede, though she did not return his feelings. In an effort to save R-76, an outpost manned by the Rigellians, Jack of Hearts was injured in battle with the Servitors. Jack was rescued by a team of Avengers, and succeeded in convincing the Infinites to restore R-76. Subsequently, Jack and these Avengers were captured, first by the Shi\\'Ar, and then by the Ruul acting under the orders of the Supreme Intelligence. Jack and the Avengers eventually escaped to Earth and helped reverse a plan to have Earth consumed by Ego the Living Planet.Jack\\'s return to Earth happened during the period known as the Kang War, and Jack of Hearts was accepted as a member of the Avengers, becoming the fifty-second superhero to join the team, though the traditional welcoming ceremony for new Avengers were deferred given the nature of the crisis they faced. During his tenure, the Avengers teamed-up with the Justice League of America, and fought the Red Skull for unleashing a biological weapon at Mount Rushmore, killing many civilians. === Death === When his power levels began to increase beyond the capacity for his containment suit, Jack of Hearts chose to commit suicide rather than continue living in an isolated containment room for 14 hours a day. Jack took a child murderer who had abducted Cassandra Lang, the daughter of Scott Lang (the second Ant-Man), along with him when he exploded in space. With his uniform destroyed in the blast, the naked body of Jack of Hearts drifted deeper into space. === Avengers Disassembled === At the onset of the \"Avengers Disassembled\" event, Jack reappeared in uniform as what appeared to be a zombie just long enough to blow himself up, killing Scott Lang and destroying half of the Avengers Mansion. Jack\\'s return was caused by the reality-shifting powers of the Scarlet Witch through methods that have remained ambiguous. Unlike his prior explosion in space, Jack\\'s body was never recovered from the ruins. === Afterlife === During the adventures of Hercules in Hades, Jack can be seen playing slots to win a chance to return to the living. This is not the intended way the afterlife should operate, according to the characters. Jack wins, and excitedly declares that he is next for resurrection. === The Children\\'s Crusade === Iron Lad (the young Kang the Conqueror) transports the Young Avengers and the amnesiac Wanda, no longer the Scarlet Witch, back to the onset of the \"Avengers Disassembled\" when Jack had been used as a weapon to destroy the Avengers. While there they discovered that he was actually the real Jack of Hearts, summoned by Scarlet Witch. Undead and quite miserable, Jack pleads with Wanda not to go through with her monstrous plan, unaware that he is facing a different Wanda. The pity of this and the horror of seeing Jack blow himself up, shocks Wanda into recovering her memory—and therefore her powers. As an unexpected side effect, the life of Scott Lang is also saved, as the Young Avengers take Scott back to the future with them when they depart, thus saving his life while preserving the timeline as everyone still \\'saw\\' him \\'die\\' in the explosion. Jack\\'s last words before exploding were, \"I\\'m sorry.\" === Marvel Zombies Supreme and resurrection === Jack Hart returned to life once more in the second issue of the Marvel Zombies Supreme mini-series. While defending scientists at Project Pegasus, (which has been besieged by zombiefied clones of the Squadron Supreme) a team of special operatives led by Jill Harper and the superhero known as Battlestar came across a source of zero-point energy which Harper believed could help them stop the zombies. The zero-point energy unexpectedly reformed itself into corporeal form as Jack, who returned to life wearing his original suit for unexplained reasons. Harper managed to revive Jack, who was temporarily amnesiac and fainting from the stress of becoming human again. Although initially weakened, Jack quickly regained control of his powers and assessed the situation. Using his powers, Jack destroyed the zombies and saved Harper\\'s life after she became infected with the zombie virus. Afterwards, the two shared a romantic kiss.Jack Hart was absent for some time, but eventually returned to a more public life when he literally crashed into the apartment of Jennifer Walters (She-Hulk), and found that he was now able to eat, drink, and sleep normally for the first time since his accident. As Jack regained his powers, he and Jen became romantically involved, Jack assisting Jen in the Reckoning War conflict as they aided the Fantastic Four. == Powers and abilities == Jack Hart\\'s superhuman powers are as a result of the mutagenic effect of his father\\'s \"Zero Fluid\", combined with the alien genes from his Contraxian mother. He has superhuman stamina and durability. Jack of Hearts also has the ability to generate \"zero energy\" within his body and project it as concussive force or intense heat or as a propellant to fly. Jack is sometimes unable to exert complete control over his energies, however. For a short time after restarting Contraxia\\'s sun, he uncontrollably radiated enough heat to melt one of Contraxia\\'s polar ice caps. He can survive unprotected in space. Jack of Hearts\\'s brain has incorporated the artificial intelligence of a computerized device called the Scanalyzer, enabling him to think with the speed of a computer and store and retrieve information with a computer-like capacity and efficiency. The left half of Jack of Hearts\\' body has turned purplish-black from direct exposure to \"Zero Fluid\". Jack of Hearts\\' left eye has an opaque white membrane covering the entire pupil. These mutations were not solely caused by exposure to the \"Zero Fluid\", but are actually aspects of his half-Contraxian genetics brought to the fore, as Contraxians naturally have such appearances.Jack originally wore a suit of armor crafted in medieval Europe. His second suit of armor was designed by Torval, and made from alien materials designed to contain the zero energy his body generates. His original suit of armor was later restored and upgraded by Moondragon after Jack was rescued from space by the Avengers and thus leading to his connection with the team.Jack is a fair hand-to-hand combatant, has had some S.H.I.E.L.D. combat training, and is a talented poet. == In other media == In the Silver Surfer TV series, Jack of Hearts is seen as part of Nebula\\'s crew. == References == == External links == Jack of Hearts (Marvel Comics) at the Marvel Universe wiki Jack of Hearts on Marvel Database, a Marvel Comics wiki',\n",
              " 'Vivek Maru is an American social entrepreneur and human rights activist who is a pioneer in the field of legal empowerment. He is currently the CEO of Namati, which he founded in 2011. Namati and its partners have supported cadres of grassroots legal advocates – sometimes known as \"barefoot lawyers\" or \"community paralegals\"– in ten countries. These advocates equip their communities to protect common lands, enforce environmental law, and secure basic rights to healthcare and citizenship.In a 2014 article, Maru complained that \"when world governments adopted development goals 15 years ago, law and justice were left out.\" As a result, while major progress has been made in the fields of health, education, and the reduction of poverty, access to law and justice has lagged behind. He asserted that all people should have the right to information about the laws and institutions they live under, the right to a legal identity, the right to have their property ownership respected, the right to participate in the shaping of laws and policies, and the right to a fair legal resolution of problems and conflicts. == Early life and education == Maru\\'s parents were immigrants from India; his grandfather was a Gandhian who ran a small printing press.Maru attended Harvard College from 1993–97, receiving an A.B. in Social Studies. He graduated magna cum laude, was a member of Phi Beta Kappa, and was Class Marshal. His thesis was entitled \"Mohandas, Martin, and Malcolm on Violence, Culture and Meaning.\" From August 1997 to August 1998, he was a Frederick Sheldon Fellow at the Harvard University Extension School in western India, where he worked with grassroots rural-development organizations, taught classes, trained teachers, designed a curriculum, and conducted research. He lived in \"a hut made of sticks and dung amid the poverty and pollution of India\\'s Kutch region, from which his grandfather came.\" He \"worked with grassroots organizations on watershed management and education for girls.\"He attended Yale Law School from 1998 to 2001, receiving a Doctor of Law (JD). According to the ABA Journal, Maru nearly quit law school \"because it wasn\\'t presenting him with a Gandhian approach\" to legal work. At Yale he was co-founder and director of the Umoja Education Program and a fellow of the Schell Center for Human Rights. He was also a Founding Team Member of the Amistad Academy Charter School. == Career == From August 2001 to August 2002, Maru served as law clerk for Federal Appellate Judge Marsha Berzon of the Ninth Circuit of Appeals in the San Francisco Bay Area. Based in New York City, he was a Finberg Fellow at Human Rights Watch from September 2002 to September 2003.After Maru was invited by a friend, Simeon Koroma, to help Sierra Leone in the wake of its civil war, they co-founded Timap for Justice, which developed a nationwide network of paralegals at a time when there were only about 100 lawyers in the entire country, almost all of them in Freetown. \"Paralegals working and living in the community can squeeze a lot of justice out of the system,\" Maru explained. Maru directed Timap from October 2003 to October 2007. During the same period he was also co-director of the Fourah Bay Human Rights Clinic in Freetown. In addition, he was a Sierra Leone-based consultant for the World Bank for four months in 2007. Based in Washington, D.C., he was senior counsel for the World Bank\\'s Justice Reform Group from November 2007 to August 2011, and director of the World Bank Justice for the Poor Program in Sierra Leone. During this period he directed a program on community paralegals in Indonesia, Philippines, South Africa, Kenya, and Sierra Leone, and created a global \"Grassroots Justice Network\" to link these programs. He also developed the World Bank\\'s first global strategy for justice reform. He is now CEO of Namati: Innovations in Legal Empowerment, which he founded in August 2011. It is an international organization that seeks to build a movement of grassroots legal advocates. Namati has 186 paralegals in Kenya, Liberia, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, Uganda, Bangladesh, India, and Myanmar, who are part of a legal-empowerment network involving some 1,000 organizations. Matt Brown, a member of Namati\\'s board, has said that \"Vivek and Namati are creating a new field of legal empowerment.\" The organization has received support from the British and Australian governments, the United Nations Development Program, and other funders. He called the organization Namati, a Sanskrit word meaning to shape something into a curve, because of Martin Luther King Jr.\\'s statement that the \"arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.\"Ashoka has distinguished Namati from other such efforts to provide community justice. While previous groups have worked alone and on a relatively small scale, have rarely documented the impact of their work, and haven\\'t been in a position to learn lessons from the results of one another\\'s work, Namati is a larger-scale activity that places emphasis on documenting its results and on enabling workers in the field to learn from one another about best practices. In 2014, Namati helped 700 Nubians in Kenya to acquire citizenship rights, resolves health-care problems in Sierra Leone and Mozambique, helped resolve violations of environmental law along the Indian coast, secured land-rights documentation for several thousand Burmese farmers, and helped dozens of communities in Liberia, Uganda, and Mozambique to win their land rights.Namati convenes the Global Legal Empowerment Network, more than 1,000 groups from 150 countries who are learning from one another and collaborating on common challenges. This community successfully advocated for the inclusion of access to justice in the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. == Honors and awards == At Harvard, he won the Frederick Sheldon Fellowship, the Harvard Foundation Award for Advancing Intercultural and Race Relations, the Revival Undergraduate Prize, and the John Harvard Award for Academic Excellence.He received the Pioneer Award from the North American South Asian Bar Association in 2008. In the same year he won the Professional Achievement Award from the Kutchi Jain Association of North America. In 2012 he won the Entrepreneur Award from the Connecticut Chapter of the Global Organization of People of Indian Origin.He received the Ashoka Fellowship in 2014. In 2015, he was named an ABA 2015 Legal Rebel. In 2016, he, Namati, and the Global Legal Empowerment Netowrk received 2016 Skoll Award for Social Entrepreneurship. In 2017, the Schwab Foundation named Vivek and Sonkita Conteh, director of Namati – Sierra Leone, two of its Social Entrepreneurs of the Year. == Memberships == He is a member of the New York Bar Association and the Council on Foreign Relations. He is a founding board member of Timap for Justice Sierra Leone and Res Publica. He is an affiliate expert with the United Nations Commission on Legal Empowerment, a member of the editorial board of the Harvard Journal of Health and Human Rights, a member of the advisory council of the International Development Law Organization Community Land Titling Project, and a member of the board of the Ebou Fund.

              " 'HMCS Carleton is a Canadian Forces Naval Reserve Division (NRD) located in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Dubbed a stone frigate, HMCS Carleton is a land-based naval training establishment crewed by part-time sailors and also serves as a local recruitment centre for the Canadian Forces Naval Reserve. It is one of 24 naval reserve divisions located in major cities across Canada. == Namesake == HMCS Carleton is named after HMS Carleton, a British schooner which took part in the American War of Independence at the Battle of Valcour Island in 1776. == History == With the establishment of the Royal Canadian Navy Volunteer Reserve (RCNVR) in 1923, the Ottawa Half-Company was stood up in 1923. In 1935, the name of the Ottawa Half-Company was changed to the \"Ottawa Division of the RCNVR\". Just prior to Canada\\'s declaration of war on Germany, the Canadian government called the Naval Reserve into active service. For the duration of hostilities, the Ottawa Division concentrated on the recruitment and basic training of sailors and by the end of the war some 4,620 officers and men had enlisted through the Ottawa Reserve Division. On 1 November 1941, the Ottawa Division was commissioned as HMCS Carleton, named after HMS Carleton, a schooner named after Governor Guy Carleton, who defeated Richard Montgomery and Benedict Arnold at the Battle of Quebec on 31 December 1775.On 17 December 1943, HMCS Carleton moved to its current facilities at Canadian Forces Reserve Barrack Dow\\'s Lake, when the new \"stone frigate\" was inaugurated in the presence of Major General Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone and the then Governor General of Canada. In 1944, a new type of naval presence was added to Carleton when the barracks blocks were occupied by the Women\\'s Royal Canadian Naval Service (WRENS). New training facilities were then added to Carleton in the late 1940s and early 1950s. A memorial anchor with plaques on a concrete base, and nine-pounder guns were erected by HMCS Carleton. This memorial, which was unveiled on 6 May 1973 by Governor General Roland Michener, is dedicated to the Naval Reservists and the Naval Reserve in the fiftieth year of the Naval Reserve.Since its establishment, members of Carleton have played an active role in the National Capital Region. In recognition of its contribution to the community, Carleton was presented with the Key to the City of Ottawa in 1976 and Freedom of the City in 2017. == Operations == Until September 2013, HMCS Carleton operated continuously to provide employment and training for its sailors. Its facilities consisted of an administration building, drill hall, classroom building, shooting range, boat shed and a large vehicle compound. On 19 March 2008 several main supports for the roof of the drill hall failed resulting in its closure and then demolition, and this accelerated plans to replace the 65-year-old administration building and drill hall. Temporary office and classroom spaces, as well as a temporary parade structure, were installed on site. At the end of September 2013 demolition of the administration building began. A new administration building, including a drill hall, was built and opened its doors in 2015. An official \\'Manning Ship Ceremony\\' was held on 21 November 2015. Although most of the sailors who are members of HMCS Carleton work on a part-time basis through the training year (September to May), there is a staff of ten full-time members (five Class B Reservists and five Regular Force) who ensure the efficient operation and administration of the unit. HMCS Carleton has administration nights every Tuesday, and training nights on Thursdays from mid-September through to early May. HMCS Carleton also has weekend training throughout the year in order to augment training. == Battle honours == Lake Champlain, 1776 == Badge == Description: Barry wavy of eight Argent and Azure the crest from the Arms of Sir Guy Carleton, Baron Dorchester which is \"A dexter arm embowed and naked at the elbow the shirt sleeve folded above the elbow Argent and vested Gules; the hand grasping an arrow in bend sinister point downwards proper.\"Significance: Although the division was named after the British schooner HMS Carleton (Battle of Valcour Island, 11 October 1776), there is no doubt that the original ship was named in honour of Sir Guy Carleton who is accredited with having saved Canada for the British in the defeat of Montgomery and Arnold at Quebec, New Year\\'s Eve 1775–1776.

              " 'Qu Xixian (23 September 1919 – 19 March 2008) was a Chinese composer. She was born in Shanghai and graduated from Shanghai National Conservatory of Music in 1948 with degrees in composition and piano. She had a full, eventful career that spanned several eras of important Chinese history. She worked with the Central Philharmonic Society and held several leadership positions on the board of the Chinese Musicians\\' Association. Her choral works were performed in 1997, 1999 and 2000 in Beijing and Shanghai. == Early life and education == Xixian was born to parents Qu Baowen and Zhu Pingyu on September 23, 1919 in Shanghai. She loved music from a very young age, and began her formal music education during her childhood. In 1939, Xixian studied with German-Jewish composer, Wolfgang Fraenkel while he was living in Shanghai. Fraenkel had a profound influence on Xixian, as well as other prominent Chinese composers such as Ding Shande and Sang Tong. From 1940 to 1948, Xixian studied piano and composition at the Shanghai National Conservatory. Among her many teachers was Tan Xiaolin, a former pupil of Paul Hindemith, before his return to the United States in 1944. Shortly after graduating from the composition department of the Shanghai National Conservatory in 1948, Xixian began to teach harmony and music history at the Beijing Art Institute, now called Beijing Opera Arts College. == Composition career == In 1949 Xixian began to compose professionally. She wrote original scores for the Central Song and Dance Ensemble (which became the Central National Music Ensemble) from 1949 to 1954. Consequently, she composed for the Central Philharmonic Society (1954-unknown). A large portion of Xixian\\'s compositions are vocal pieces. She was particularly interested in choral writing and her unconventional use of diverse vocal timbres resulted in unique and innovative work. She became musically renowned for her beloved choral arrangements of Chinese folk songs. For example, her most famous piece “Pastoral” (Mu Ge) is a four-part vocal work based on the Dongmeng (Zhaowuda League, Inner Mongolia) folk song “Throwing Sticks.” In this piece, Xixian employs Western tonality and harmonically-driven melodies in conjunction with polyphonic interweaving. In 2010, the work was performed by Peiyang Chorus and can be viewed.Xixian had given personal concerts of choral works in 1987,1999, and 2000 in Beijing and Shanghai; had published Qu Xixian Chorus Selections in 2003, including 53 pieces, among which were arrangements of Pastoral, Usuli Bacarole, Clouds Flying Over the Unmoving Sky, and original compositions: Flying Petals, Call Me By My Pet Name, The Cuckoos are Singing, etc. Many of her works are still being performed in the 21st century. Xixian published C.D. and cassette entitled Flying Petals including 16 chorus works in 1995. Many of her works are still being performed in the 21st century. == Works == === Choral works === Pastoral (1954) Listening to Mother Talking of the Past (1957) - (lyrics by Guan Hua) First Prize in 1980 Children\\'s Song Contest. Chinese NCPA Chorus Cantata of the Red Army Base (1958) The Rickshaw Boy (1982) Call Me By My Pet Name (1985) We and You (1987) - First Prize Children\\'s Song Contest The Flying Petals (1988) - First Prize Teacher\\'s Song Contest.

Releasing Pigeons at the Great Wall (1992) - First Prize Children\\'s Song Contest === Film scores === Song of Youth (1959) Music of the Red Flag (1960) Xiangzi the Camel (1981) == Leadership positions == Throughout her life, Xixian was involved as a composer and administrator for several elite music societies and organizations. In 1979 she was elected as the Director of the Chinese Musicians\\' Association. A few years later, in 1985, she became the Vice President. == Political involvement == A great deal of Xixian\\'s compositional work reflects various historical periods she lived through in China, such as New China, the Cultural Revolution and the Reform Era. Along with several other Chinese artists in the 1950s, Xixian used composition to participate in protesting their government\\'s plan to control social messages in music. Many songs that were written by this generation of Chinese musicians are still sung in the 21st Century. Xixian\\'s song in particular was quite positive and celebratory, entitled “Quan Shijie Renmin Xin Yi Tiao” which translates to “All The World’s People Are of the Same Mind.”Many of her compositions were inspired by folkloric stories or by what she observed of the world around her. Particularly, a few of her songs reflected the challenges and struggles faced by the Chinese lower class. For example, The Rickshaw Boy was inspired by the novel Rickshaw Boy written by Lao She, detailing the life of an impoverished boy who supports himself by towing a rickshaw. == Personal life == Beyond her musical career, Xixian\\'s interest in socio-political developed throughout her entire life. At the age of 18, Xixian left Shanghai and travelled to Hunan to participate in anti-Japanese rioting that occurred there in 1937. Toward the end of her life, Xixian greatly suffered from lung cancer. She believed that China should pass a “Right to Die” law, stating that “A good death is better than living with pain.\" On March 19, 2008, she died from lung cancer at the age of 89. While she was alive, her interests included reading and socializing with her friends. == Family == Ex-husband: Zhao Fusan == See also == Chan Hing-yan == References ==',\n",

There were also water shortages with drought worsening the impact of the heat wave. == Background == According to the India Meteorological Department, a heat wave is defined as a maximum air temperature of at least 40 °C (104 °F) in the plains and 30 °C (86 °F) in hilly regions, and is also declared when the maximum temperature remains 45 °C (113 °F) or higher, irrespective of the normal maximum temperature.In India, the month of May is typically one of the hottest and driest. In 2016, the heat came early, with 111 heat-related casualties reported by 8 April. Most of the heat waves in India since 1998 are associated with droughts; a major drought and worsening water shortages had affected around 330 million people by 23 May. The high temperatures, combined with other atmospheric disturbances, led to thunderstorms and lightning strikes in some states, leading to deaths, the destruction of houses and uprooted trees, as well as affecting crops and farm animals. The monsoon rains that would provide some relief were nearly one week behind the scheduled date, and would not reach the north until several weeks later.More than 20,000 people have died of heat wave-related causes in India since 1992; the heat wave in 2015 was one of the five deadliest on record. == Impact == The highest temperatures typically occur in May or June prior to the annual monsoon. Increasing temperatures and more frequent heat waves appear to be a result of human-induced climate change. In response to these more frequent events, many cities across India have implemented plans to warn people of the dangers of excessive heat.While the number of deaths was relatively small, those most likely to die from heat exposure were labourers who were forced to work outside despite a government ban limiting work during the hottest part of the day. Schools were also ordered to extend the summer holiday to reduce the risk to children. The greatest impact of the extreme temperatures were on crops, with hundreds of millions of people affected by the failure of food crops.The government hospital in Phalodi reported 500 patient visits, double the average number; many of those patients were complaining of diarrhea. To combat the heat, people drink water, but in 2016 the heat was coupled with drought. Lack of adequate water leads to dehydration and consumption of contaminated water leads to diarrhea. It is likely that the death totals were significantly underestimated due to a lack of systematic data collection. == Health effects == A heat wave usually causes severe health conditions and death. Heat stroke and heat stress are two of these adverse effects. Also, the heat wave was the main cause of the prevalence of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases in hospitals. The humidity and temperature increases caused harmful health effects, especially for vulnerable people such as the elderly, children, outdoor workers and people in poor living conditions. Indian people\\'s health were affected indirectly by water scarcity for both drinking and grazing purposes. That led to heat-related health challenges such as dehydration hyperthermia. Therefore, Indian people suffered from dizziness and organ dysfunction. In Phalodi, people suffered from diarrhea and high body temperature.The mortality rate differs in India during different months and in different cities. At the beginning of April 2016, more than 100 people died from heat. In the three Indian cities of Delhi, Telangana and Odisha more than 600 died in just one month. In the region of Bihar, 180 people died, and a large number were affected by heat stroke. The National Disaster Management Authority Government of India shows that 1,111 died because of the heat wave in 2016. == Local response == In Orissa, Maharashtra and Gujarat, programs were launched to educate people on hydration, providing shelters and training medical workers. In Andhra Pradesh, government workers distributed water and buttermilk, whilst TV and newspaper adverts urged people to stay indoors during peak hours.Schools were shut down in Odisha and Telangana weeks ahead of summer holidays. Hospitals stopped performing surgeries. A ban on day-time (9am - 6pm) cooking was imposed to prevent accidental fires. India\\'s Supreme Court ordered the Indian Premier League out of Maharashtra, stopping 13 cricket matches because of the amount of water needed to prepare pitches.There were numerous calls for more government action. Leading Indian economists, rights activists and academics sent an open letter to the government expressing the same. In his monthly radio address, Modi pledged 20 billion rupees ($400 million) to deal with the crisis.In Maharastra, the local government\\'s response to the portable water shortage was to supply water to its city via train. The train became known as \"Jaldoot\" (Hindi), meaning \"water saviour\". In a single nine-hour journey the train was able to deliver 2.5 million litres of water. == References ==',\n",
              " 'Carlo Salteri (23 October 1920 – 12 October 2010) was a prominent Australian businessman, mechanical engineer, founder of Tenix and co-founder of Transfield. == Background and early years == The eldest child of Giuseppe and Flavia Salteri, Carlo Salteri was born on 23 October 1920 and raised in a well-heeled family in Milan, Italy. In 1940 he commenced an engineering degree at Politecnico before being called up by the Italian army a year later, where he served as a junior artillery officer. At the conclusion of World War II Salteri commenced work with Italian engineering company, Società Anonima Elettrificazione SpA (SAE), before the company was awarded a contract to build powerlines in Australia. Salteri was appointed in charge of the 25 workers travelling to Australia, together with Franco Belgiorno as his deputy. In 1951 Salteri migrated to Australia with his wife Renata and young family. == Career == === Transfield === After working in Australia for five years with SAE, in 1956 both Salteri and Belgiorno-Nettis (as he later became known) jointly decided to leave SAE and form Transfield, in a partnership that lasted 40 years. The company focused on major engineering projects, such as bridges, tunnels, dams, hydro-electric and coal power stations, oil rigs, concert halls, sugar mills and power lines. Included in their list of major achievements are the construction of the Gateway Bridge in Brisbane and the Sydney Harbour Tunnel. By the early 1980s, Transfield had in excess of 3,000 employees and an annual turnover of A$350 million; and within five years grew to the point of being the biggest engineering firm in south-east Asia. The company acquired the Williamstown Dockyard in Melbourne and, in 1989 after winning a A$6 billion contract to build ten ANZAC class frigates for the Australian and New Zealand governments, the largest defence company in Australia. When visiting Australia in 1986 Pope John Paul II toured the Transfield factory located at Seven Hills.The pair stood down as joint managing directors in 1989 in favour of their eldest sons, Paul Salteri and Marco Belgiorno-Zegna. However, in a dispute between Salteri and Belgiorno-Nettis in 1995, the differences between the two families became irreconcilable and Transfield, then valued at A$733.2 million was split in two. The Belgiorno-Nettis family kept the name Transfield and the construction side of the business, while the Salteri family got the company\\'s North Sydney headquarters and the defence operations, which they then renamed as Tenix. === Tenix === Tenix grew quickly on the back of the contracts to construct the ANZAC class frigates and completion of the Jindalee Operational Radar Network (JORN) project. The company expanded across the defence sector into engineering infrastructure and service businesses, such as gas, water, electricity, and the supply of speed cameras and traffic wardens. By the time that Salteri retired in 2007, Tenix had annual revenue of A$1.7 billion. Tenix sold its defence business to BAE Systems in June 2008, and its main business interests are in infrastructure and parking and traffic businesses across Australia, New Zealand, the Pacific and the USA.The name Tenix derives from tenacity, inspired by a comment made by Salteri\\'s grandfather when Salteri was a young boy: \"...to make one million, one has to start from a 5 centime coin...\"Salteri reputably kept this coin from that day, until the day of his death. == Personal == In 1999, Salteri was made a Grand Officer of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic by the Italian government. In 2002, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia for service as a leader in industrial and technological development in Australia, to the engineering, construction and manufacturing industries, and to the community through a range of artistic, cultural and health-related organisations.Salteri established the Tenix Foundation to provide assistance for education, research and underprivileged children. Up until his death, Salteri was a patron of the Australian Indigenous Education Foundation and was a key supporter of education for Indigenous students.Salteri died at the Mater Hospital in Sydney after a short illness on 10 October 2010, aged 89. == See also == Tenix Tenix Defence Transfield Services == References ==',\n",

              " 'The Samad (Arabic: صماد) (also spelled Sammad) is a family of long-range UAVs of unidentified origin used in the Middle East. The Samad is available in three variants: The Samad-1, the Samad-2 (also known as \"UAV-X\"), and the Samad-3. The Samad family of UAVs is primarily used by the Houthi movement in the Yemeni civil war, where the drone\\'s long range is used to strike targets in Saudi Arabia and the UAE. == Etymology == The UAV was named after Houthi leader Saleh al-Sammad, who was assassinated by the UAE in 2018. == Design == The Samad is available in three models. All models have distinctive V-shaped tail fins and a pusher engine. Samad UAVs have a ventral protrusion and wing skids, which they use for takeoff and landing.The Houthis say they have designed and manufactured the Samad family of drones. They say that the Samad 1 was designed in 2018 and the Samad Samad 2 and Samad 3 in 2019. Independent analysts say the Samad-2 is probably of Iranian origin.[needs better source] According to James Rogers, of the Center for War Studies at the University of Southern Denmark, the Samad 3 is believed to be supplied by Iran.The Samad-1 is the base variant. It has a wingspan of approximately 3.5 meters. It has a range of 500 km and is for surveillance.The Samad-2 is 2.8 meters long and has a wingspan of 4.5 meters. It has distinctive V-shaped tail fins and is powered by a rear-mounted German or Chinese pusher-engine. It is also known as the \"UAV-X\", the provisional designation given to it in a UN report. The Samad-2 can carry either a reconnaissance or an explosive payload. The reconnaissance version carries a camera, a Nikon D810 digital camera in one model. The attack variant has a warhead of 18 kg of explosives mixed with ball bearings.The Samad-3 is an \"extended-range\" version with a conformal fuel tank mounted on the top of the drone. The dimensions are estimated at 4.5m wingspan, like the Samad-2. According to the Houthis, it has a range of 1,500 km and carries an explosive payload. Qualitatively, the Samad-3 is described as \"inexpensive, small, slow and clumsy\" and unlikely to strike targets with good accuracy. == Operational history == The Houthis have operated Samad UAVs since at least August 2018.The Houthis say a Samad-3 UAV was used to attack Abu Dhabi international airport on 26 July 2018. Analysis by Jeremy Binnie of Jane\\'s of footage released by the Houthis of the attack says it is consistent with a Samad-2 or Samad-3, or also a different drone, the Hudhud 1. The UAE denied there was any drone attack on the airport. Two other alleged claims on a drone attack on the airport were reported by the Houthis, as well as two attacks on Dubai International Airport, all which were denied and unverified. An investigation by Bellingcat, published months before video of the attack was released, said \"It is highly likely that a Houthi-led drone attack did not take place in Abu Dhabi and Dubai\".The Houthi military spokesman said used Samad 3 drones, at the Abqaiq–Khurais attack on 14 September 2019. == Operators == Hezbollah– Samad-1 (according to two bloggers, Stijn Mitzer and Joost Oliemans) Houthis – Samad-1, Samad-2, and Samad-3 Iran – IRGC, Samad-1 (according to the above bloggers.) == Specifications (Samad-2 / UAV-X) == Data from UN Panel of Experts on YemenGeneral characteristics Crew: none (unmanned) Length: 2.80 m (9 ft 2 in) Wingspan: 4.50 m (14 ft 9 in) Powerplant: 1 × Chinese-made DLE 170 or German-made 3W110i B2 enginePerformance Maximum speed: 200–250 km/h (120–160 mph, 110–130 kn) Ferry range: 1,200–1,500 km (750–930 mi, 650–810 nmi) (est. by engine manufacturer)Avionics unknown == References == == External links ==',\n",

              " 'Caesar Tarrant (1740–1797) was an American boat pilot who served as a patriot in the American Revolutionary War. Born a slave, Tarrant\\'s skill as a pilot aboard the Patriot led to his manumission by the state after the war. == Early life == Tarrant was from Hampton, Virginia, home to many river boat pilots. Though a slave, by the time he was a young adult he had learned how to pilot vessels through the nearby riverways. He was sold once after gaining this skill and it increased his sale price. He married Lucy, a woman enslaved by a different owner, and they had three children. == Revolutionary War == Lord Dunmore, governor of the Colony of Virginia, responded in 1775 to early revolutionary actions by recruiting Virginians to strike back. He issued Dunmore\\'s Proclamation, offering freedom to any enslaved people who fought for the crown. Hundreds signed up to fight with him, but Tarrant decided instead to fight for the Patriots.The Virginia Navy hired Tarrant as a pilot, placing him on several vessels during the war. While serving on the Patriot in 1778, Tarrant participated in a battle at the Virginia Capes, a high priority area for the navy. Tarrant out-maneuvered and rammed the Lord Howe, a British privateer vessel. Both sides took injuries and the British ship escaped, but Tarrant garnered praise from his captain, who said he \"behaved gallantly\". == After the war == Having served in the state navy for three years, Tarrant returned home to Hampton. The state and fledgling United States governments had not promised freedom to slaves fighting on the Patriots\\' side. Tarrant remained enslaved and was passed on to his owner\\'s daughter after his death in 1784. In 1789, the Virginia General Assembly directed the executive branch to purchase Tarrant and manumit him. The purchase was concluded that year, and the newly-free Tarrant began freeing the rest of his family. == Legacy == In his will, written in 1796, Tarrant willed his property in Hampton to his wife, with half to go to their daughter Nancy upon Lucy\\'s death. His son Sampson also inherited some property. Lucy sold part of the estate to free their daughter Lidy from slavery.Two schools in Hampton were named after Tarrant. Cesar Tarrant Elementary closed in 2015. Cesar Tarrant Middle School was renamed from Jefferson Davis Middle School in 2018, with support for the renaming shifting in part due to backlash against the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. == Notes == == References == === Bibliography === Jackson, L.

In May 2017, he joined Place Beauvau as a diplomatic advisor to the Minister of the Interior. === Honorary consuls === As a whole of the consular jurisdiction (nearly 4 million km2), the honorary consuls relieves the actions of the Consulate within the states of the Northwest. Usually, they legalize certain administrative procedures and directly collaborating with the Consulate General. However, they can not provide passports, identification cards or create official registration (documents such as birth certificates, marriage licenses, or death certificates).Current honorary Consuls: Alaska - Mrs. Catherine Ferret California (Sacramento) - Mr. Guy Michelier Guam - Mrs. Joëlle Wainer Hawaii - Mr. Guillaume Maman Idaho - Mrs. Gabrielle Applequist Montana - Mrs. Laurence Markarian Nevada - Mr. Pascal Baboulin Oregon - Mrs. Françoise Aylmer Utah - Mrs. Marie-Hélène Glon Washington - Mr. Jack Cowan Wyoming - Mrs. Séverine Murdoch === French presence === The Consulate General collaborates regularly with numerous French associations and organizations abroad. == France in California == === California, French territory? === On September 15, 1789, Jean-François de La Pérouse dropped anchor in Monterey Bay and then, marking the first official French presence in California. The explorer collected precious geographic and scientific goods from the region, boasting its \"enormous resources\" and strategic position. The French naturalist and botanist, Eugène Duflos de Mofras, was sent to the Pacific coast during the 1840s and published his book in which he depicts a vast region with a population of merely 4,000 people.The American West coast particularly interested the king, Louis-Philippe I, who had hoped to rebuild the great French empire before 1763. The summon of Louis Gasquet as Consul General of Monterey in November 1843, illustrates a type of political offensive by the government of the time. This unexpected presence worried American and Mexican authorities who struggled for the monopoly of the region. France was the first country to have official representation in California and Gasquet, aware of the predominant position of France, pushed the government to send naval forces as soon as possible. Refusing to recognize the sovereignty of Sloate and Stockton, established during the American independence from England, Gasquet was imprisoned for 51 days (in reality, a sentinel was placed in front of his home, preventing him from completing his consular mission). After an exchange of diplomatic letters, Louis Gasquet was finally released and replaced by Jacob Moerenhout in October 1846. Preserving the interests of his citizens and observing the turbulent behavior of his neighbors, Moernhout created a region favorable to French immigrants. He settled in the Consulate of Monterey, situated by the sea: \" a spacious house with a beautiful rose garden and orchards\". === The French community of San Francisco === When San Francisco was still called Yerba Buena (\"the good herb\"), only three French nationals were recorded among 800 inhabitants. However, the rapidly growing population (23,000 inhabitants in 1852) enticed the government of President Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte to establish the French Consulate in San Francisco, the new economic capital of the region. France already had a consular agent that exercised his duties until the arrival of the first Consul General, Mr. Patrice Dillion, on July 22, 1850. Unable to settle in a city still under construction, the Consul accepted the hospitality of a damp French ship on the bay. Sometime later, he decided to take residence on the corner of Jackson and Mason. The position of Consul General of France in San Francisco was significant because it introduced the most important diplomatic representation in all of the Western United States. According to Jehanne Biétry-Sallinger, California consisted of 352,000 inhabitants, of which 28,000 were French, almost 8% of the total population. The principal mission of the consulate at the time was to provide emergency assistance to new immigrants. When they arrived in this faraway and unknown region, their first stop was the consulate, to receive information and money to settle and work in the mines. San Francisco was an unsafe city and brawls often broke out between French and foreign miners. The Consul had to quickly flee to the hinterlands to escape being hung by his fellow citizens, as in Placerville in 1853. Moreover, the Consul organized numerous public ceremonies in honor of events that affected France, such as the storming of Sebastopol in 1855. This troubled period saw the development of a united and dynamic French community that grew each day as a result of boats shipping migrants bound for the \"streets to gold\". Most stayed and settled permanently: the erection of Notre-Dame-des-Victoires Catholic parish in 1856 is the most striking example. The church continues to celebrate Mass in French today. Gradually, the community organized and founded restaurants, laundries, and theaters near Bush and Mason Street; the French quarter thus developed rapidly. === The Consulate General of France in San Francisco === After 1892, the consular office moved to 604 Commercial Street, next to the port within the Financial District. Documents of the time disclosed an exact description of the Consulate of France : \" the neighborhood is modest, its entry is abrupt, but it seems as though there are enough serious motifs which have unfortunately been often criticized by the French colony and French voyagers in passing, the Consulate will be preserved here where it is. Insufficient funds for rent were administered to the chief of staff who then had to pay the remaining sum from his own reserves(…) in addition, our Consul would have received the authorization to renew the antique furniture that remained. It is necessary to include that the great majority of foreign consulates should not have a better status. The budget does not always measure up to amount expected. \" The earthquake of 1906 in San Francisco ruined most French investments and the consulate was completely destroyed. On April 20, 1906, a telegram addressed to the Quai d\\'Orsay reads, \"The manager of our Consulate in San Francisco telegrams me with hopes to inform the Department that the Consulate is destroyed; the personnel is safe, the archives have stayed under the rubble. \" Little France therefore lost all its influence in local life. After the earthquake, the consulate settled at the Union Trust Building. Following the Second World War, that witnessed the succession of two Consuls to the same post (one representing Vichy France, the other liberated France), the Consulate installed at 690 Market Street. After the war, the residence of the two Consulates would be closed and official receptions would be held just in front, in the Palace Hotel. By 1958, the Consulate moved to a more spacious location in a three-story building on the corner of Bush and Taylor. During the 1970s, the consulate acquired of a very beautiful residence on Jackson Street (bought in 1967), in Pacific Heights. Sadly, the narrowness of the building and its miserable location, forced the Minister of Foreign Affairs to find a new local. It was after the construction of a modern building on 540 Bush Street (next to the church Notre-Dame-des-Victoires) that the Consulate installed in 1981. In 2011 the consulate moved to the 6th floor of the modern office tower on 88 Kearny Street. == Annexe == == See also == List of diplomatic missions of France Embassy of France, Washington, D.C.

Their first leader, Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Yusuf, a son of Ali ibn Yusuf al-Massufi and the Almoravid Princess Ghaniya, was appointed as governor of the Balearic Islands in 1126. Following the collapse of the Almoravid power at the hand of the Almohads in the 1140s, the Banu Ghaniya continued to govern the Balearic Islands as independent emirs until about 1203, with a brief interruption in the 1180s. Later leaders (Ali ibn Ishaq and Yahya) made a determined attempt to reconquer the Maghreb (and in particular Ifriqiya), taking Bougie, Constantine and Algiers, and conquering most of modern Tunisia from about 1180 onwards. They were influential in the downfall of the Almohad Empire in Eastern Maghrib.

              " 'The 36th Iowa Infantry Regiment was an infantry regiment that served in the Union Army during the American Civil War. == Service == === Early days of the regiment === The Thirty-sixth Iowa Infantry Regiment, US Volunteers, was one of several Midwestern volunteer regiments raised in Iowa, Illinois and Wisconsin in the late winter, spring and summer of 1862. Companies A and K consisted of men from Monroe County, while Companies B, C, D, E, F G, H and I were made up of men from Appanoose and Wapello Counties. A handful of additional men were mustered for the regiment from Wayne, Marion, Lucas, Davis, Lee and Van Buren Counties. The first recruits were mustered into state service as early as February 1862. The ranks were filled out with additional recruits following Lincoln\\'s July 1862 call for 300,000 state volunteers and, by early September, the regiment was officially designated the Thirty-sixth Iowa Infantry Regiment. Colonel Charles W. Kittredge of Ottumwa Iowa was placed in command. Colonel Kittredge had previously served as a captain with the 7th Iowa Infantry Regiment in Missouri during the first year of the war and was an experienced combat veteran. All companies rendezvoused at Camp Lincoln, Keokuk, Iowa where, on 4 October 1862, they were sworn into United States service for a term of three years. The men were first issued old Austrian and Belgian smoothbore muskets with \"sword\" bayonets, but these antiques were eventually replaced with more effective .58 caliber Springfield rifled muskets. Following four weeks of basic training at Camp Lincoln, the regiment departed Keokuk on 1 November 1862 aboard two steamboats for St. Louis to await corps and division assignment and to continue training. === St. Louis, Memphis and Helena === At St. Louis, the regiment went into garrison at Benton Barracks. The Thirty-sixth was attached to the XIII Corps, Army of the Tennessee, and commenced drill by brigade and division. On 20 December 1862 they embarked by steamer for the federal garrison at Helena, Arkansas. The vessel halted at Memphis, Tennessee when the local citizens hailed it from shore with an alarming report that Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest and his cavalry were in the neighborhood and were preparing an attack on the city. That night the men of the 36th slept with their arms stacked nearby in Jackson Square. The regiment eventually moved to some old vacated mule-sheds and remained in Memphis performing guard duty at Fort Pickering until 1 January 1863, when it resumed its movement to Helena. At Helena, the regiment became part of the 1st Brigade, 13th Division, XIII Corps under General Benjamin Prentiss. The regiment was initially quartered in tents but later moved into winter quarters at Fort Curtis in semi-permanent \"half-cabins\" consisting of log walls with canvas ceilings and dirt floors. These billets had formerly been occupied by the 47th Indiana Infantry Regiment. According to Captain Seth Swiggett of Company B, the ex-Postmaster at Blakesburg, Iowa, the Iowans devised an efficient central heating system in these cabins by burying a length of stovepipe beneath the dirt floor and running it the length of the cabin from a small tin stove on one end to an exhaust pipe on the opposite end. With 5 to 8 men occupying each cabin, the regiment passed the month of January 1863 in as comfortable a manner as could be expected under the circumstances. === The Yazoo Pass Expedition and the First Military Action at Shellmound, Mississippi === In February 1863, the Thirty-sixth Iowa, 600 strong and part of 13th Division of the XIII Corps commanded by General Leonard Ross, embarked on troop transports for Mississippi to take part in the Yazoo Pass, or Fort Pemberton Expedition. This operation was conceived by General Grant and entailed blowing an opening through the east bank of the Mississippi River near Moon Lake below Helena to open a channel connecting with an inland water route that would enable Grant to encircle the Confederate stronghold at Vicksburg, Mississippi from the north. Veterans of the regiment recalled that during reconnaissance patrols the men had to wade through swamps waist deep. The regiment saw its first action at Shellmound, Mississippi where, after witnessing a fierce artillery duel between federal gunboats and rebel batteries, Captain Swiggett noted that the 36th Iowa had a \"sharp exchange\" with the rebels The regiment was holding a picket line some 2 miles above the enemy fort and was under frequent artillery fire for several days. No men were killed by enemy action due to the cover afforded by woods on the west bank of the Tallahatchie River. The regiment was engaged on this march for 43 days. They found no unguarded route to Vicksburg and the expedition was abandoned. The men suffered greatly because of almost continuous exposure to the elements on this campaign, including freezing rain and high winds that blew their tents down. In addition to colds, flu fevers and rheumatism, many men were struck down by typhoid and malaria. === The Battle of Helena === Returning to Helena, the Thirty-sixth commenced a physically demanding daily regimen of drill and building fortifications in anticipation of a Confederate attack expected with the arrival of spring weather. The Thirty-sixth was assigned to build breast works and trenches in support of Battery A at Fort Curtis, on the northernmost end of the Union defenses. The federal line ran in a semicircle around the town with the Mississippi River being their east flank. On 4 July 1863, a Confederate force under General Holmes estimated at between 8,000 and 10,000 attacked Helena. With devastating artillery fire and additional fire support from the U.S. Navy gunboat Tyler anchored in the river offshore, the Union positions repulsed the assault in a savage, bloody slugfest lasting from dawn until 2 p.m. under a burning hot sun. The Confederates nearly captured some of the federal redoubts where the fighting devolved into hand-to-hand combat. Confederate losses were estimated at 2,000–3,000 and more than 700 of these were taken prisoner. The federals remained on the field in their assigned positions for two more days until it was clear that Holmes\\' rebels were in full retreat to Little Rock. Much of that time was allowed to burying hundreds of Confederate dead in mass graves where they had fallen. Vicksburg also surrendered to Grant on 4 July while elsewhere General George Meade repulsed Lee at Gettysburg. The two victories at Helena and Vicksburg on 4 July, and the surrender of the rebel strong-post of Port Hudson on 9 July, ended further serious Confederate threats to federal operations along the Mississippi River and severed communication between rebel forces on opposite sides of the Mississippi for the remainder of the war. With New Orleans, Port Hudson, Vicksburg, Helena, Memphis and Columbus Kentucky in federal hands, the Confederacy west of the river was isolated from secessionist allies in the east. However, rebel guerrilla bands continued to harass federal river traffic from both banks of the Mississippi until the end of the war. === DeValls Bluff, Pine Bluff and the capture of Little Rock === Following the battle at Helena, the Thirty-sixth was attached to the Third Division, 1st Brigade, Expeditionary Army of Arkansas commanded by Major General Frederick Steele. Marching from Helena on 12 August, the Third Division reached Clarendon, on the White River. Steele complained to his superior, General Stephen Hurlbut at Memphis that he was burdened on his march by at least 10000 men on the sick list. It got even worse at Clarendon, a malaria-breeding village. A number of men of the 36th were left there awaiting river transportation north to DeValls Bluff, where Steele was establishing his main supply base. Those fit to march left Clarendon and proceeded north to DeValls Bluffs. At this point, Brigadier General John Davidson arrived with the 1st (Cavalry) Division and rendezvoused with Steele. Davidson\\'s division did most of the heavy fighting with the troops of Confederate generals Marsh Walker, John Marmaduke and Sterling Price over the next twenty days. As Davidson moved forward and captured Brownsville, the Third and Second Divisions followed . When Davidson\\'s force was blocked at Reed\\'s Bridge, on Bayou Metoe, the 36th and other regiments of the Third Division made a demonstration on the confederate left flank as a diversion. Steele and Davidson then decided on a surprise flank attack from the south bank of the Arkansas River, which was executed on the morning of 10 September. Although not unanticipated, Marmaduke and Price were surprised by the speed with which Davidson made the crossing at Ashley Ford. Driving westward straight toward Little Rock, the infantry of the Third Division followed a parallel course supporting artillery batteries firing on the rebels from the north shore. By 7:30 pm Price and Marmaduke had abandoned the capital and civil authorities surrendered Little Rock to Davidson. Steele arrived a day later. The 36th Iowa did not cross the Arkansas and enter the city until 15 September due to the fact that in their retreat, the Confederates had burned the boat-bridge spanning the two shores, and then a Union pontoon bridge broke down. Upon entering Little Rock, the Third Division and 36th encamped on the spacious high ground south of town near the re-captured U.S. Arsenal and there constructed a permanent camp for winter quarters and endured a bitterly cold winter. Meanwhile, Price and Marmaduke escaped toward Camden, Washington and Murfreesboro to winter while Arkansas state officials moved their capital to the county courthouse at Washington, Arkansas near the Texas-Louisiana border. === The Dodd Affair === On 8 January 1964, an 80-man detachment from the 36th Iowa and similar detachments from all of the Union regiments encamped near the arsenal formed on the parade ground to witness the execution of 17-year-old David Dodd, a Confederate spy. Dodd had attended nearby St. John College—a private secondary academy—but dropped out after a few months and relocated with his parents to Texas when the Union Army occupied Little Rock. He became a telegraph clerk and learned Morse Code and next joined his father who was a civilian sutler for a Confederate regiment stationed in Mississippi. Returning to Camden Arkansas, Dodd intended to return to Little Rock, ostensibly to visit former classmates and an older sister still enrolled there. He obtained a pass to depart Confederate lines from General James Fagan, who allegedly told young Dodd, \"I expect a full report upon your return.\" Approaching Union lines he obtained a legitimate US Army pass and continued into the city where he spent three days. As Dodd departed Little Rock on the afternoon of the third day, he headed down the Benton road southwest of the city and passed through a federal picket line, where he surrendered his pass, believing he had exited federal lines. Two miles further, however, Dodd encountered a second Union picket line and, having no pass, was arrested by federal troopers of the 8th Missouri Cavalry. Taken before an officer, Dodd was interrogated and could not provide a satisfactory explanation for wandering through the neighborhood at that hour. A notebook taken from him contained notes in Morse Code that, when translated by the assistant army telegrapher, described accurately much of the federal Order of Battle in Little Rock and the disposition of infantry regiments and artillery batteries. With this incriminating evidence in hand, Dodd was taken before a senior officer of the 8th Missouri and further interrogated. It was at this point the prisoner was body-searched, and additional papers and a loaded Derringer pistol were found in his coat. A full investigation revealed that Dodd was almost certainly assisted by a local female accomplice, who was also brought before military authorities and interrogated. Dodd was sentenced to death by a specially appointed Military Commission on a 4 to 2 vote on 5 January 1864. An execution date was set for 8 January. Steele did not bring charges against the female—a close friend of Dodd\\'s and a vocal secessionist whose father quartered Union officers in his home. Instead of charging the daughter and son, Steele had them removed from the Department of Arkansas and deported to Vermont, their native state. There they were essentially placed on house arrest for the duration of the war. Dodd\\'s case drew the attention of thousands of Arkansans who sought clemency. Steele offered clemency to Dodd if the youngster would reveal who his accomplices were, which offer Dodd refused. The morning of Dodd\\'s execution he was placed on the end-gate of an army ambulance wagon that had been driven beneath a scaffold. Bound hand and foot, Dodd was made to step out onto the wagon tailgate which was propped up by a stout wooden post. The noose was placed around his neck and the post was knocked out from beneath the tail-gate causing the teenager to fall straight down. Unfortunately, the rope stretched, and the fall did not break Dodd\\'s neck; he struggled for several minutes as he slowly strangled to death. After nearly 10 minutes a Union surgeon pronounced him dead. Some federal soldiers who witnessed the execution described it as a \"sickening\" and \"ghastly\" affair. but evidence from diaries and letters indicates most felt no remorse or were disturbed by Dodd\\'s execution. === The Camden Expedition of the Red River Campaign === On 6 January 1864, the Army activated the VII Army Corps to reorganize the former \"Expeditionary Army of Arkansas\" that had captured Little Rock. Additional regiments were brought to Little Rock from other theaters through the months of January, February and March. The formal announcement of the establishment of the VII Army Corps was made to the troops in February. Steele was resistant to the notion of invading southern Arkansas, primarily due to the already existing shortage of rations at Little Rock, and the fact that any expedition south of the Arkansas river would further distance the army from its already precarious supply lines. Finally Steele received a direct order from Grant (his West Point classmate) to move south and proceed toward Shreveport, Louisiana to link up with Union forces under command of General Nathaniel Banks, who by then had already commenced a campaign up the Red River, converging upon Shreveport. The plan called for Steele\\'s Corps to link up with Banks there and together the combined Union force would push into East Texas to \"Plant the US flag.\" It was hoped that Steele\\'s southward thrust from Little Rock would catch Confederate Commander E. Kirby Smith—Commanding the Confederate Army of the Trans-Mississippi—in a pincer movement, force Smith to fight a two-front action and thus divert precious Confederate resources from the main line of battle on the Red River. It proved to be one of the most ill-advised Union operations of the entire war. Against his better judgment, the skeptical Steele departed Little Rock on 23 March with some 12,000 troops, including the 36th Iowa Infantry Regiment, restricted to half-ratrions. He knew that the country through which he would march was barren and that foraging alone would not supply sufficient grass for horses and mules or food for the troops, and that federal supply trains from Little Rock and Pine Bluff would be essential to his effort. The column immediately encountered rebel skirmishers along the line of march that followed the Old Military Road from Little Rock southwestward to Washington Arkansas near the Texas border. Steele would skirmish and fight major actions against the Rebel Army of Arkansas under Major-General Sterling Price on each of the next 30 days. The first major engagement took place as Steele\\'s column reached Elkin\\'s Ford on the Little Missouri River on 3 April. Some 2,500 rebels lay in ambush at the ford and viciously attacked as the federals made their crossing. A sharp infantry and artillery exchange ensued in which the 1st Battalion of the Thirty-sixth Iowa played a key role. Under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Francis Drake, the small Federal detachment of about 500 men from Companies A, D & G, 36th Iowa, three companies of the 43rd Indiana, two picket companies of dismounted troopers of the 1st Iowa Cavalry, and a two-gun artillery section from Battery E, 2nd Missouri Light Artilley skirmished all day as the Confederates bought time to bring up 2,500 reinforcements under command of Major-General John S. Marmaduke after nightfall. Fighting renewed at 6 a.m. the following mornings and lasted 7 hours as Drake and his small command gave ground stubbornly as the larger rebel force tried to drive them back into the Little Missouri River. Meanwhile, Colonel Charles Kittredge moved up the remaining 7 companied of the 36th Iowa to Drake\\'s support. Ordering them to lie down behind a slight ridge on the edge of a cleared field, they lay in wait for the right moment. Marmaduke\\'s artillery concentrated own both Union flanks and on the Federal gun section at last compelled the three companies of the 43rd Indiana holding the Union left flank to give way. Retreating toward the field in disarray, Colonel Kittredge ordered his 7 companies to stand up and fire. They delivered such a devastating volley of musket fire at point blank range that Marmadukes\\' rebels were completely routed and forced to retire south toward Prairie D\\'Ane with significant casualties. Steele\\'s column was at this time reinforced by Brigadier General John Thayer\\'s Frontier Division which had marched from Fort Smith. The combined column continued onward, harassed at every opportunity by rebel skirmishers and snipers as it proceeded slowly on dusty roads through thick forests to the southwest. These attacks slowed Steele\\'s progress and the Corps managed to move only 82 miles in 10 days. Facing the unexpected resistance, and growing dangerously short on supplies, Steele placed all troops on quarter-rations. The Confederates finally attacked in force as the federals emerged into open country on the Prairie D\\'Ane near present-day Prescott, Arkansas. The rebels had built fortifications in depth on the prairie. Much of the fighting at Prairie D\\'Ane was an artillery duel, while the 36th Iowa was brought forward to help make a flanking demonstration on the rebel right flank that convinced Marmaduke to retire from the prairie. Sweeping the rebels aside, Steele now learned from prisoners and spies that Bank\\'s Red River expedition had been soundly beaten at Grande Ecore, and that Banks was in full retreat. With his men on 1/4 rations and now deep in enemy country, Steele changed course and made for Camden, hoping that the Navy could re-supply him there using the navigable Ouchita River. The defeat of Banks on the Red River enabled Kirby Smith to immediately move General Dick Taylor\\'s Texas division north into southern Arkansas—bringing additional infantry regiments with him from Louisiana and raising some newly recruited units along the way. Taylor opposed this movement, preferring to continue to chase Banks\\'s army on its retreat to Alexandria and hopefully destroy him there. Realizing his imperiled situation, Steele prepared to abandon Camden and march back to Little Rock. === Massacre at Poison Spring === Steele moved into Camden on 15 April with almost no resistance and discovered that the rebels had destroyed all the steam gristmills near the city except Britton\\'s Mill some 6 miles south of town. The 36th Iowa was ordered to seize the mill and they spent the next few days getting it back in operation and grinding what supply of corn could found by Union foraging parties into meal for the army. Steele meanwhile sent scouts foraging for other sources of grain and food, and word soon reached his headquarters that a large cache of corn had been discovered some 18 miles northwest of Camden on the upper Washington Road near Poison Springs. On 17 April, Steele ordered Colonel James Williams of Thayer\\'s Frontier Division to assemble a foraging patrol consisting of the 1st Kansas Colored Infantry, elements of three Kansas cavalry regiments, a battery of light artillery and 198 wagons to collect the grain. The next day as the loaded federal wagons were getting underway for the return to Camden, the escort was met by the 18th Iowa Infantry which had marched out to reinforce the party at first light. Near the road junction a few miles from Poison Spring, the advance of Williams\\' column was ambushed. Outnumbered nearly 8 to 1 by the forces of Generals John Marmaduke and Samuel Maxey, the federals were hit first by Maxey\\'s troops lying in ambush in heavy thicket on their right flank. As they changed front to meet that attack, the larger force to their front assaulted and nearly encircled the federals. Cut off from their route of escape, they were driven steadily to the rear and took refuge behind sheds of a nearby plantation where efforts were made to rally the men to make a stand. The relentless rebel attack pushed them to the rear of the train which they were forced to abandon and some 900 yards further, all the way to a timber line and into a swamp. Those in the rear of the retreating federal column were scattered and in disarray and soon encircled and were shot down or were compelled to surrender. The federals suffered more than 300 casualties, including 204 wounded. True to the threats of Jefferson Davis and the Confederate Government, Negro troops received no quarter in this battle. Most of the enlisted men of the 1st Kansas Colored Infantry were killed, wounded or were summarily executed after they surrendered. Such was the savagery found in the western theater of operations during the Civil War. The disaster at Poison Spring resulted in the loss of 198 supply wagons, a four-gun battery—which however were spiked by the federal gunners—and the horses and mules to pull them, exacerbating further Steele\\'s supply problem. The men of the Thirty-sixth Iowa clearly heard the sounds of the Poison Springs battle to their northwest and then discovered that Fagan had moved his mounted brigade up to within two miles of Brittons\\' Mills. Realizing that the rebels could attack them at first light with overwhelming numbers, and having no artillery and just a small cavalry detachment with them, the regiment loaded their wagons and made a forced march back into Camden after dark. . === Disaster at Mark\\'s Mills === A 240-wagon supply train arrived at Camden from the federal base at Pine Bluff on 20 April, but it only carried half-rations for ten days. With supplies short, Steele ordered Lt. Colonel Francis Drake, Thirty-sixth Iowa, to take temporary command of the 2nd Brigade to escort these wagons back to Pine Bluff. At Pine Bluff, Drake was to refill the wagons and escort the train back to Camden. Colonel William McLean, the brigade commander was reported to be \"indisposed,\" while Colonel Charles Kittredge, next in line for command of the 2nd Brigade, was reported sick in quarters; Kittredge thus sent his number two, LTC Drake in his place to command the train and the 2nd Brigade. Major Augustus H. Hamilton assumed direct command of the 36th Iowa on this operation. The remainder of the brigade included elements of the 1st Indiana Cavalry and 5th Missouri Cavalry, the 43rd Indiana Infantry, 77th Ohio Infantry, and four artillery pieces in two section of Battery E, 2nd Missouri Light Artillery—about 1,200 troops in all. Additionally, the 1st Iowa Cavalry Regiment, which had served its 3 years and was on its way home on furlough and for re-enlistment, was scheduled to follow and catch up with Drake\\'s train on the 1st or 2nd day. The brigade also included a section of 75 civilian Negro pioneer laborers whose job it was to move ahead of the train, felling trees and laying them down to build corduroy roads over the muddy, difficult route. The train with escort left Camden on Friday, 22 April and Drake soon found that an additional entourage of some 50–75 civilian wagons carrying teamsters, sutlers, cotton speculators, about 300 Negro refugees and other assorted camp followers had joined the expedition. Due to very muddy road conditions, progress was slow and the column was harassed by cavalry scouts belonging to Rebel General Jo Shelby\\'s \"Iron Brigade\" on the first day out from Camden. Shelby had no interest in bringing on a general engagement but was ranging widely east of the Ouachita River to keep an eye on Union forces operating there. The scouts who skirmished with Drake on the first day immediately informed Shelby of the large supply train, and when Shelby linked up with a large Confederate Task Force commanded by Major-General James Fagan the following day, Fagan decided to make a forced march with 7 brigades 50 miles east to establish and ambush position. By mid-afternoon of the second days of march—a Sunday—Drake had reached the western approach to the Moro River—essentially a large creek that habitually went out of its banks in a wide swath due to spring rains. Lieutenant Samuel Swiggett, B/36th, recounted in his memoirs that, while no surface water could be discerned in the Moro Bottom, the ground was so saturated by the recent rains that anyone or anything attempting to cross it would become hopelessly buried deep in mud and muck. Steele had cautioned Drake not to attempt to cross the Moro Bottom after dark, and additionally, the civilian teamsters were starting to get out of hand, complaining to Drake about the rigors of the pace, according to Swiggett. Rather than proceed, therefore, Drake halted the column on the west bank of the Moro Bottom on Sunday afternoon. In his official after-action report, Drake stated that he stopped the column that Sunday \"evening\". The timing is very much in dispute, for Captain Swiggett later noted in his memoirs that the column halted long before nightfall and in fact had gone into camp on the west bank at 2 pm Sunday. Captain Swiggett opined that, had Drake exhibited more backbone by insisting on moving across Moro Bottom Sunday afternoon, the entire train could have crossed safely before nightfall, would have been well on its way to Pine Bluff, and would have avoided the tragedy to come. Although Drake could perhaps claim later that he was technically following Steele\\'s orders by going into bivouac when he did, Swiggett noted that there was a strong sense of gloom and foreboding in the federal camp as they lay there immobile on Sunday afternoon. As it was, Drake posted cavalry squads of 25 troopers each 2 miles to his front and 5 miles to his rear on Sunday, with orders for them to scout all roads for 5 miles in all directions at daybreak on Monday. Sunday night passed without incident and, having received no reports of the enemy from his scouts on Monday morning, Drake ordered the march resumed. The 43rd Indiana Infantry Regiment was deployed to lead the way, while the 36th Iowa marched on the flank of the wagons. Drake ordered the 77th Ohio to form the rear-guard and that regiment lagged almost 3 miles to the rear. As the column crossed the Moro Bottom with difficulty and headed to higher ground, federal scouts informed Major Wesley Norris commanding the 43rd Indiana that they had discovered signs of large, hastily abandoned cavalry encampments to their immediate front. Norris sent a report back to Drake, who dismissed it rather curtly and sent forward orders for the 43rd to pick up the pace. A short distance further, in a clearing at a fork in the road occupied by a few log cabins, the 43rd Indiana was fired on by dismounted rebel cavalry from General Fagan\\'s command. Fagan had evaded Union scouts the previous night by crossing the Ouachita River below Camden and making a forced march (52 miles) to get into position ahead of Drake\\'s train between the Moro and Pine Bluff. That morning they were lying in ambush near the crossroad clearing, known as Mark\\'s Mills, just east of present-day Fordyce in Cleveland County. Forming line of battle, the 43rd Indiana\\'s Norris ordered his command to charge Fagan\\'s dismounted cavalry. As the charge commenced, Confederate General William Cabell\\'s mounted cavalry revealed itself from concealed positions in the trees on the south, or right flank. What began as a skirmish at around 8:30 am quickly developed into a very hot firefight with the Federals firing in two directions to beat off the assault. The well-aimed fire from the veteran Federal infantry was devastatingly effective and slowed Fagan\\'s advance. Drake ordered the train to pull off the road into an empty field and then ordered Major Hamilton to deploy the first battalion of the 36th Iowa Infantry up and onto the firing line on the 43rd Indiana\\'s left flank. Just as this battalion came on line, the Confederates charged the center and took another devastating musket volley from the Federals. Drake then ordered up Peetz\\'s 2nd Missouri Battery at the double-quick. As Peetz\\'s gun crews swung their guns into position, the Federal infantry was ordered to move to both flanks to open a hole in the center. This was done with alacrity and Peetz\\'s gun crews opened fire on the rebels with grapeshot at less than 200 yards. This stunned the Confederates, resulting in a momentary lull in the battle, but musket fire quickly resumed. As the Iowa and Indiana infantrymen were concentrating on the rebels to their front and right flank. General Jo Shelby\\'s two cavalry brigade swooped down on them from the left flank, where Shelby had waited in reserve for more than an hour. Three companies of the 36th Iowa, the entire 43rd Indiana and Captain Peetz\\'s battery of the Second Missouri Light Artillery were now pressed on three sides and were in danger of being encircled. Drake ordered the remainder of the 36th Iowa Infantry—five companies commanded by Captain Joseph Bull Gedney—into position at the extreme left flank. Drake sent an order to Gedney to support a cavalry charge into Cabell\\'s troops to push them back, prevent encirclement and attempt a link-up with the 77th Ohio, which was now moving forward to join the battle but still a mile to the rear. Before this message could be delivered however, Drake was wounded and fell from his horse from blood loss. The rebels proceeded to close the trap when Shelby made his charge on Gedney\\'s battalion. The Federal troops were surrounded, it quickly became a confused entanglement of small units fighting small units and then it became, according to Captain Seth Swiggett, \"Every man for himself.\" Shelby\\'s and Cabell\\'s troopers rushed down on the now disorganized Federals, capturing them in groups of two or three until there was no further resistance. Veteran survivors reported that the battle lasted fully five hours. Some men of the 36th Iowa\\'s first battalion took cover in the log cabins and kept up a withering and deadly fire, holding out from those protected positions until long after the others had surrendered, and until they exhausted their ammunition. When the insurgents threatened to burn the cabins down, the Iowans surrendered. In his after-action report, Cabell stated that 17 prisoners were taken from the larger of the two cabins. According to Captain Swiggett, when capture became certain, most of the Iowa men smashed their rifles against trees rather than hand them over to their captors. As the men of the 36th and 43rd Indiana were being rounded up and disarmed, a last-ditch effort to break into the Confederate ring by some brave federal cavalrymen created enough confusion and a diversion for some of the Iowa soldiers to bolt and escape. Several disappeared into the nearby woods and a few headed to the rear to warn the 77th Ohio of the overwhelming size of the enemy force to their front. Reaching a mounted captain of the 77th, the 36th Iowa men were accused of being deserters and their alarm was not heeded. The 77th\\'s commanding officer ordered his regiment forward at the double quick into the melee and soon that regiment was also overwhelmed by the three rebel cavalry divisions and compelled to surrender. The best casualty figures indicate that the 36th Iowa lost 42 killed outright and 89 wounded, of whom about 40 later died of their wounds. The remainder became prisoners and were force-marched to the notorious rebel prison stockade at Tyler, Texas. Some of the men who escaped evaded re-capture by moving across country, carefully avoiding rebel patrols. Half starved, exhausted and unarmed, some reached the safety of Union lines at Pine Bluff, while others managed to reach Little Rock. There they reported the news of what had befallen their comrades at Mark\\'s Mills. Colonel Powell Clayton, the federal commander at Pine Bluff, reported to General Sherman a few days after the battle that 186 Union cavalry and about 90 federal infantrymen had managed to escape and report in at Pine Bluff and at Little Rock. The 36th Iowa Infantry had ceased to exist by 3 pm on 25 April 1864. === The Battle of Jenkins\\' Ferry === Learning of the disaster at Mark\\'s Mills, Steele immediately put the VII Corps in motion from Camden on the morning of 26 April with the object of crossing the Saline River at Jenkins\\' Ferry and retiring to Little Rock. The corps made a forced march northeastward to the Saline, where high water necessitated the installation of a rubber pontoon bridge. Steele then moved his army across the swollen river, one wagon at a time, one gun limber at a time, and had three-quarters of his trains and artillery on the opposite bank when his rear-guard regiments were strongly attacked by the pursuing Confederates. In a savage battle that ranged through plowed fields on the south bank of the Saline, Steele\\'s troops poured volley after volley into the pursuing insurgents, first stalling their attack, and then turning it and buying time for the lead elements of the column to cross the pontoon bridge. Union infantry then made their crossing and took up guard from the opposite bank. Steele ordered the pontoon bridge to remain in place two more hours to enable wounded men and stragglers to be rescued. Then the bridge was destroyed in place, and allowed to sink into the river. While Steele\\'s Corps got bogged down on muddy roads north of the Saline, it managed to make a safe withdrawal to Little Rock. While the majority of 36th Iowa Infantry troops were captured at the Battle of Mark\\'s Mills, some men of the 2nd Brigade—including Thirty-sixth Iowa men who had been left behind sick in quarters at Camden—were not present with the regiment at Mark\\'s Mills. When Steele abandoned Camden therefore, these 36th Iowa remnants were assigned to a Casual Detachment under the command of Captain Marmaduke Darnall of the Forty-third Indiana, and these men fought bravely with the Casual Detachment in the Battle of Jenkins\\' Ferry. === Prisoners of war at Camp Ford === Some 240 men of the 36 Iowa Infantry Regiment were captured at Mark\\'s Mills. In the aftermath, those too seriously wounded to be moved were left under guard at the home of the Marks Family on whose property the battle had taken place, and in the care of the regiment\\'s medical aides. Lieutenant Colonel Drake, who had been seriously wounded by a bullet to the hip, was held only a week before being paroled and released. Drake returned to Iowa for treatment and convalescence. Meanwhile, several of the regiment\\'s battle dead were interred on the Marks Family property. The wounded and regimental medical aides were left under the supervision of Lieutenant Benjamin Pearson, B/36th. The Confederate soldiers assigned to remain at Marks Mills to guard the wounded federal soldiers had no medical supplies and, after a few days, they asked Lt. Pearson to travel into the Union lines at Pine Bluff and bring back food and medicine for the wounded. Pearson succeeded in this task, but he did not return to Marks Mills, instead sending the supplies back to Marks\\' Mills by a courier and then re-joining the federals and eventually making his way back to Little Rock. Pearson had not been wounded in the battle, and his selection as officer to remain behind with these seriously wounded soldiers may have been due to the fact that Pearson had served as a second chaplain with the regiment since its days at Helena. The Confederate victors of Marks Mills robbed the survivors of every valuable item they possessed, including hats, boots, watches, money and in some cases, the clothes on their backs. Overall, they were very roughly handled by their captors, according to Captain Swiggett. They were force-marched to the rebel prison at Camp Ford in Tyler, Texas, where dozens of them perished from disease over the next 12 months. Conditions at Camp Ford were primitive. Although a good spring provided cool clean water, and while the Confederate guards slaughtered cattle to supply the prisoners fresh beef regularly, the prisoners had no shelter from the sun or rain except improvised huts or blankets, and as the numbers of prisoners rose, the sanitary conditions declined precipitously, leading to many deaths from exposure, chronic diarrhea and disease. A number of the 36th Iowa\\'s officers escaped. Captain Swiggett twice escaped but was recaptured on both occasions and was rewarded for his bad behavior by being one of the last prisoners exchanged. Those who survived the horrors of Camp Ford were paroled on 25 February 1865, and exchanged at New Orleans on 28 February. After several days of recuperation there, the former prisoners were granted 30 days home leave, and started for Iowa. Those who were still deemed fit for duty returned to join the rest of the regiment—five small companies consisting of men not taken prisoner—at DeValls Bluff, Arkansas by 1 April 1865. In the months after Marks Mills and Jenkins Ferry, some 237 officers and men not captured at Marks Mills carried out garrison duty at Little Rock and later St. Charles Arkansas until the Confederacy surrendered. With more than a month left to serve, the reconstituted regiment—fortified with recently recruited volunteers—was sent as garrison troops at DeValls Bluff—the primary Federal supply depot on the upper White River. The regiment was mustered out of federal service at DeValls Bluff 24 August 1865. The veterans returned north to Davenport, Iowa, where they received their final Army pay and were dismissed from state service. === Postscript === The Union Army never controlled the territory of Southern Arkansas, but it occupied the capital and effectively took the state out of the war for all practical purposes and contained the threat to Missouri from Sterling Price in October 1864 and for the remainder of the war. Lieutenant Colonel Francis Drake, was promoted full Colonel on 8 May 1865 and shortly thereafter to Brigadier General. In a strange sequence of events, Colonel Charles W. Kittredge was court-martialed for habitual drunkenness and conduct unbecoming an officer in a 10-day trial at Little Rock in January 1865. Although acquitted by the court—which consisted of several of Kittredge\\'s old friends—the decision was overturned by Major General J.J. Reynolds, who had relieved Steele in command of VII Corps in November 1864. Reynolds sent a recommendation to President Lincoln that Kittredge be cashiered from the service. The War Department notified Kittredge of his dismissal in March. Kittredge, however, fought the decision and after much effort, secured his commission and command of the regiment on 15 August 1865-just ten days before the 36th Iowa was mustered out at DeValls Bluff. But few officers of the regiment paid any attention to the decision or to Kittredge, and they continued to take orders from Drake and Brevet Major William Vermillion. Kittredge seized a technical victory but he never restored his reputation with the officers and men of the 36th Iowa. The regimental colors of the Thirt-sixth Iowa Infantry are on display in the rotunda of the Iowa State Capital in Des Moines. === Officers of the Thirty-sixth Iowa Infantry at Mark\\'s Mills, 25 April 1864 === Lieutenant Colonel Francis M.

              " 'Gary D. Robson (May 11, 1958) is an American author from Red Lodge, Montana. He is best known for his children\\'s picture book series entitled Who Pooped in the Park?, which teaches children about animal scat and tracks. The series currently comprises 20 books, mostly set in United States National Parks. The 20th book in the series was released in 2016, covering Central Park in New York City. Robson is also an expert in closed captioning and subtitling technologies for deaf and hard of hearing people. == Biography == Robson was born in Poughkeepsie, New York in 1958 and grew up in Colorado, where he graduated from Boulder High School in 1976. He began writing for technical journals in 1984, and wrote a series of computer manuals before writing his first book in 1996 with Richard Sherman (a.k.a. Mr. Modem). He continued to write while working in the electronics industry until 2001, when he and his wife moved to Montana and purchased a bookstore. He was the publisher and editor-in-chief of the monthly alternative newspaper in Red Lodge, The Local Rag. === Closed captioning === Cheetah International, the company founded by Robson and his wife, began producing software and equipment for closed captioning in 1997, and Robson published articles on the subject for a variety of publications, including the Journal of Court Reporting, Newswaves, and Nuts & Volts. He holds two patents related to closed captioning: U.S. Patent #7,360,234 (2008) and U.S. Patent #8,245,252 B2 (2012). He was presented with the Andrew Saks Engineering Award for \"outstanding contributions in improving visual accessibility to information via realtime captioning for deaf and hard-of-hearing Americans\" by Telecommunications for the Deaf, Inc. in 1997. He wrote three books about closed captioning, most notably The Closed Captioning Handbook, published by Focal Press, then an imprint of Elsevier. He presented a TED Talk at TEDxBozeman in 2014 entitled, \"Does closed captioning still serve deaf people?\" == Works == === Children\\'s picture books === The Who Pooped in the Park? series is published by Farcountry Press in Helena, Montana. Each book in the series focuses on the indigenous wildlife of a particular National Park or ecosystem in the United States. Robson has used two different illustrators. Elijah Brady Clark illustrated the first six books, and Robert Rath has illustrated the rest.

              " 'Dense Pack is a strategy for basing intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) for the purpose of maximizing their survivability in case of a surprise nuclear first strike on their silos conducted by a hostile foreign power. The strategy was developed under the Reagan administration as a means of safeguarding America\\'s inventory of MX missiles during the final decade of the Cold War. It was never used; MX was deployed in existing silos and then removed from service as the Cold War ended. == MX basing debate == The U.S. commitments under the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty prevented the development and construction of adequate ABM installations around its nuclear missile silos. Therefore, it was decided that new and unconventional strategies for protecting these military assets from a sneak-attack had to be developed. The original concept had been to place the MX missile silos on the reverse side of tall hills or mesas. This was known as \"reverse inclination basing\". Enemy warheads approach at an angle of about 25° above horizontal, so if the slope of the hill was greater, the warhead would impact the hill short of the silo, outside its lethal range. This concept relies entirely on the warheads approaching from a certain direction, and as the Soviets introduced their Fractional Orbital Bombardment System and high-angle \"lofted\" trajectories, this no longer offered any extra protection. The introduction of submarine launched ballistic missiles, which could be launched from any direction, ended it as a useful concept. In 1979, after a long debate on the topic, President Jimmy Carter selected the \"multiple protective shelters\" concept for basing the MX. In this system, the 200 MX missiles would be partnered with many thousands of silos, and the missiles would be periodically moved among the silos so the Soviets would not know where they were. In order to attack the MX fleet and do any significant damage, they would have to attack every silo. With enough silos, they would use up much of their warhead inventory to destroy only 200 missiles, a cost that was so high they would not contemplate it. Derided as the \"racetrack\" proposal, the primary problem was that it required huge tracts of land. It was immediately opposed in Nevada, and finally fell out of favor in Utah when the Mormons turned against it as well. == Dense Pack == When Ronald Reagan took over in 1981 he agreed to reexamine the basing question, as opposition by Nevada senator Paul Laxalt had become overwhelming by this point. For the immediate future, 60 MX\\'s would be placed in surplus Titan II missile silos while a final basing solution was chosen. After an equally long and contentious debate, the Dense Pack system was chosen. The new strategy was mentioned in a speech by President Ronald Reagan in 1982.According to the Dense Pack strategy, a series of ten to twelve hardened silos would be grouped closely together in a line. This line of silos would generally run north-to-south, as the primary flight path for Soviet inbound nuclear missiles would be expected to come from the north over the North Pole. Each \"super-hardened\" silo would require an almost direct hit ground burst to destroy the missile within. When the first warhead went off, it would create a huge cloud of debris that was ejected thousands of feet into the sky. When the next warhead arrived it would hit this debris and be destroyed. Even if a warhead was successful in reaching the ground, it would create more dust and then lower the chance of the next one working. This basic idea had been considered during the Minuteman missile era under the name dust defense. In this case, it was US nuclear bombs buried near the silos that created the cloud of debris. This was abandoned because the \"dust\" would be extremely radioactive and millions would die when the resulting fallout fell back to the ground. In this case, however, it was Soviet warheads causing the fallout, which was politically acceptable. The proposed Dense Pack initiative met with strong criticism in the media and in the government, dismissed as \"duncepack\" or \"sixpack\". Detractors of the Dense Pack strategy pointed out a number of flaws. First, the advent of multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles, or MIRV, negated the concept due to their ability to conduct a time-on-target barrage. Since all the warheads were arriving from a single missile, they could easily be launched to arrive within seconds of each other. In this case, the explosions would not yet have created the massive cloud of dirt, and they would all fall largely unimpeded. Secondly, there were widespread doubts at the time that the hardened nature of the armored missile silos were as robust as the military claimed. If the silos could not survive a near-miss, then clustering the silos would allow a single warhead to destroy multiple silos, perhaps all of them. If the silos were not as hard as claimed, Dense Pack actually lowered their survival rate. Finally, Dense Pack was perceived by some to be a provocative, if not overtly hostile measure at a time when nuclear warfare seemed to be a distinct possibility. Ultimately, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected using the Dense Pack strategy by a 245–176 vote.The U.S. Air Force reconsidered the use of the Dense Pack strategy in 1986, at least in part to find a way to add 50 additional missiles authorized by Congress only if a \"safe\" basing strategy could be found. There is no evidence that the Dense Pack strategy was ever implemented. == References ==',\n",

              " \"Princess Gardens is a neighbourhood in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located in the western area of Toronto that was formerly the City of Etobicoke. Its boundaries are Eglinton Avenue to the north, Martin Grove to the west, Islington to the east, and Rathburn Road to the south. The southeastern part of this area is the separate neighbourhood of Thorncrest Village. The neighbourhood is divided into two areas: The portion east of Kipling Road is known as Princess Anne Manor, while the portion west of Kipling is Princess Margaret Gardens. They are named after Princess Anne, Princess Royal, and Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon, the daughter and sister of the late Queen Elizabeth II respectively. Both Princesses visited the Gardens and opened up Princess Margaret Public School during its opening ceremony. The southwestern part of the neighbourhood is also sometimes known as Glen Agar. Princess Gardens has some of the highest income Canadians in the Greater Toronto Area according to a 2016 census, at an average of $222,218 per year. == Character == This is a post-war developed residential area. Its main street is Eglinton Avenue, a four-lane arterial road running east–west along the north of the neighbourhood. Residential subdivisions back onto Eglinton along this stretch. North-south are Martin Grove, Kipling and Islington Avenues, all four-lane arterial roads with detached homes on both sides. The density of the housing is very low, and road patterns are generally curved roads leading into cul-de-sacs to reduce traffic. Largely built along an extension of the street 'The Kingsway' north of Dundas St, the area developed in a radically different manner than 'The Kingsway' neighbourhood to the south after the northern extension of the Kingsway was cut off from the south with the construction of a highway-style interchange at Dundas and Royal York. Like 'the Kingsway' neighbourhood to the south, many streets in Princess Gardens carry 'royal' names: The Kingsway, Prince George Dr, Princess Margaret Blvd, Princess Anne Cr. == Education == The neighbourhood is home to schools operated by the public Toronto District School Board (TDSB), and the Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB). TDSB is the only public school board that operates secondary schools in Princess Gardens, Martingrove Collegiate Institute and Richview Collegiate Institute. TDSB and TCDSB elementary schools located in Princess Gardens include: John G. Althouse Middle School is a middle school located in Toronto, Ontario, near the intersection of Lloyd Manor Drive and Princess Margaret Boulevard. St George's Junior School is a public elementary school on Princess Anne Crescent, located in the Princess Anne Manor community on the south side of Princess Margaret Boulevard. The school first opened in 1956 and expanded in 1960 to include additional classroom space. Rosethorn Junior School is a public elementary school on Remington Drive, located close to the intersection of Rathburn Road and Kipling Avenue. It first opened in 1952 as a kindergarten to grade 8 school, but was closed in 1984 because of declining enrolment. It reopened in September 1996 as a French Immersion kindergarten to grade 5 school.

He qualified for the 2016 Olympics by finishing in second place in the 3000 meters steeplechase at the 2016 United States Olympic Trials.Bor attended Arnesens High School south of Eldoret, where he ran a 9:15 steeplechase and was district champion in the long jump and pole vault. He also ran a 3:55 1500 meters in high school. In 2007 he won a scholarship to Iowa State University, where he placed fourth in the steeplechase at the 2008 NCAA Championships in 8:36.84 earning All-American status. He improved that to second place in 2009 and added an Academic All American status to another All American improving his personal best to 8:35.12. In 2010 he finished third at the NCAAs. His senior year earned him second team Academic All American.His older brothers Emmanuel and Julius Bor also ran for an American college, the University of Alabama. The brothers found a path to citizenship in the country of their education by joining the United States Army. While serving on different bases, the three teamed up to win the All Armed Forces Cross Country Championships in February 2016. All three were in the top 20 of the USA Cross Country Championships, Hillary finishing eighth.Bor's time of 8:30.70 in the steeplechase at the April 2016 Stanford Invitational was the world leading time at that point of the season. At the Olympic Trials, Bor was running in fifth place well behind Evan Jager's lead position. Another Kenyan-American, Stanley Kebenei was the closest to Jager but began to fade as Bor, Andy Bayer and Donn Cabral were chasing. The diminutive Bor made up over ten meters on the backstretch and had passed Cabral before the water jump. As he passed Bayer on the outside their two elbows made contact. On the outside, Bor was clean over the water jump and off to the races after Jager, on the inside Kebenei was unable to find his way out of the pit and fell onto all fours, causing Cabral to have to make an extra barrier jump over his body while Bayer sidestepped the fall but was losing ground chasing Bor. Perhaps angered by the incident, Cabral took off sprinting, catching Bayer who was unable to respond and tied up going into the finish. Bor's last lap was the fastest of the field. His time of 8:24.10 was a new personal best. After the race, the Nike Bowerman team filed a protest against Bor (the only non-Nike athlete in the final five) that was unsuccessful.In 2017, he competed in the men's 3000 metres steeplechase at the 2017 World Athletics Championships held in London, United Kingdom. == References == == External links == U.S. Army World Class Athlete Program profile\",\n",

Young, owned and operated a women\\'s specialty dress shop when Young died in 1911. Miss Quinlan decided to expand her business and, wanting to have the best in design, consulted with department store managers and owners in New York and Chicago. She hired Frederick L. Ackerman of New York to design a \"\\'beautiful home\\' for her merchandise.\" The local associate architects were Magney & Tusler.Unique to the design of the building is making each of the four facades as if it were the front facade. Typically, commercial buildings were designed to have a street facade that would be the most attractive and welcoming side because it was assumed that other sides would be hidden by adjacent construction. The facades of the Young–Quinlan building look the same with arched windows, columns and decorative elements giving each side the appearance of being the entrance side of the building. A parking garage, a modern innovation for the time, was also included in the construction of the building. The building was clad with rusticated Kasota limestone on the first floor, with brick walls above and stone pilasters and columns surrounding windows. The interior has a marble staircase, crystal chandeliers, and metalwork of iron, brass, bronze, and pewter. One distinctive feature was the last elevator in the city still operated by an elevator operator.In 1979 staff at the City Planning Department of the Office of the Mayor recommended that the exterior of the building be awarded preservation status. In 1985, renovation of the building for use by multiple tenants was begun by the owners, The 614 Company, and three years later the company sought historic designation from the Minneapolis City Council. The building was designated as a local landmark by the Minneapolis Historic Preservation Commission in 1988. == References ==',\n",
              " 'Xandria was one of the largest distributors of sex toys and adult videos, books and novelty items in the United States. It began as a catalog of sexual aids for people with disabilities at a time when the disability rights movement was in its infancy. Xandria was also one of the first companies to sell sex-related items online. The business closed in 2016 when Lawrence Research Group, Inc., which operated the business, filed for dissolution with the Nevada Secretary of State. == Xandria History == Xandria was founded in 1974 by Gaye Raymond, a San Francisco physical therapy professor, and her husband, Victoria\\'s Secret founder Roy Raymond. Gaye Raymond\\'s philosophy was that people with disabilities should be able to enjoy as much of life as possible, including an active sex life. Xandria began as a catalog-based distributor of sexual aids for people with physical and developmental disabilities.The original Xandria Collection offered mostly educational adult videos and books, as well as vibrators and sex toys that were easier to grasp and maneuver by people who had physical impairments due to an amputation or illness. The company\\'s guarantee of privacy, product quality and personal satisfaction helped it develop a following among the general public, especially among those who didn\\'t want to be seen entering their local porn shop.Xandria\\'s products were shipped in discreet packages that did not bear the company\\'s name. Customers could request a refund within 60 days if they were not satisfied with their sex toys for any reason.Gaye and Roy Raymond sold the Xandria Collection in 1984 and the company\\'s inventory was expanded to appeal to the general public. In addition to a catalog for people with disabilities, the company began selling condoms, erotica, dildos, lubricants, vibrating cock rings, triple crowns, penis pumps, lingerie, masturbation aids, and other sex-related products. In 1999, it also began carrying explicit sex videos distributed by sister company 1st Skin. The company\\'s new owners also created an advisory board of health and sex experts. Members included sex educator, activist and author Betty Dodson; journalist and author Michael Castleman, who penned the Playboy Magazine Advisor from 1991 to 1995; and clinical psychologist Louanne Cole, who now serves as resident expert for WebMD\\'s \"Sex Matters.\" Xandria was initially headquartered in San Francisco. It moved to Brisbane, California in 1993 and to its final location in the Las Vegas Valley in 2005. In 1997, the company launched Xandria.com, one of the first online stores dedicated to selling sex toys and adult videos. The site and the company itself have generated positive press from well-known publications such as Playboy, Esquire, Hustler, and Men\\'s Fitness.In its final phase, customers could order items through the mail and by calling a toll free number, but most of the company\\'s sales were generated through its website. Xandria did not have a physical store. Xandria.com carried a long list of sex-related items, as well as articles on sexual health written by well-known authors. Several sex toys from the Xandria Collection were featured in the 2007 film Stash, an indie comedy starring Tim Kazurinsky and Marilyn Chambers. The film is about \"Discreet Removals,\" a company that will remove people\\'s stashes of pornography and sex toys after their death, so that unsuspecting spouses and family members can \"concentrate on grieving\".

              " \"Platanthera yadonii, also known as Yadon's piperia or Yadon's rein orchid, is an endangered orchid endemic to a narrow range of coastal habitat in northern Monterey County, California. In 1998 this plant was designated as an endangered species by the United States government, the major threat to its survival being continuing land development from an expanding human population and associated habitat loss. One of the habitats of Yadon's piperia, the Del Monte Forest near Monterey, California, is the subject of a federal lawsuit, based upon endangerment of this organism along with several other endangered species. This wildflower may lie dormant in a given year and not emerge above the soil surface from its tuberous substructure. After leafing out in the spring, it will produce flowers on erect spikes, each flower possessing both green and white petals. It prefers sandy soils, and subsists on nutrient extraction from intermediate fungal organisms. == Description == Along with most other orchids P. yadonii: (a) is a bisexual perennial green plant that grows from buried tubers; manifests a fruit capsule bearing numerous minute seeds; (b) exhibits pollen that is sticky, and which is removed as sessile anther sacs; and (c) has a stigma fused with its style into a column. Yadon's piperia exhibits a basal rosette leaf formation. The subsurface architecture of this terrestrial wild orchid consists of a rhizome structure, from which emanate tubers. The rhizome extracts nutrients from fungal intermediates and may also store some of these nutrients. A basal rosette of leaves develops from the tuber at the surface of the soil, each of the two or three leaves being lanceolate in shape. Each leaf ranges from 10 to 15 centimeters in length and 20 to 35 millimeters in width. Leaves of younger plants are often more diminutive in size. The dense inflorescence is borne on a single erect vertical spike varying from 12 to 55 centimeters in height. Each flower has a spur of length 1.5 to 5 millimeters, short compared to other members of the genus. Yadon's Piperia typically presents three upper tepals, each of which contains both green and white pigmentation; moreover, there are three lower tepals that are white only. The earliest blooming time is June. When P. yadonii blooms, as late as August, all of its sepals and petals may be purely white. Another key identification feature is the characteristically abbreviated spur, which typically measures 1.5 to 6.0 millimeters in length. P. yadonii's leaves usually wither by blooming time, except for a small percentage of very large individuals. The geographic range of P. yadonii overlaps that of P. elegans, P. elongata, P. michaelii, and P. transversa; consequently, P. yadonii is clearly distinguished from them only in the flowering stage. Sympatric occurrences in mixed populations with P. elongata and P. elegans are noted in the literature. == Reproduction and symbiosis == Seeds of this species, like other orchids, lack an endosperm. The extremely small seeds must come in contact with appropriate soil fungi in order to germinate. The resulting seedlings obtain fixed carbon from the fungus until they produce their first leaves and begin to photosynthesize. This strategy is known as myco-heterotrophy. Vegetative reproduction may also occur. == Distribution and habitat == Yadon's piperia is confined to a handful of locations in the coastal area of north Monterey County primarily the Del Monte Forest on the Monterey Peninsula. Tiny populations have been found in the Prunedale Hills; and an isolated southernmost population on Rocky Creek Ridge (Cushing Mountain) at Big Sur. Specific places of occurrence within those areas are the S.F.B. Morse Botanical Reserve; Manzanita County Park; and the Nature Conservancy’s Blohm Ranch Nature Preserve. Each colony is rather small in patch size, measured on the order of twenty acres or less. All of the occurrences are below about 250 meters above mean sea level and all are within six miles of the Pacific Ocean. Yadon's piperia is generally restricted to three habitats: (a) Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) forest, sometimes with Gowen's cypress (Cupressus goveniana ssp. goveniana) which includes more than 80 percent of the known populations; (b) California Northern coastal scrub, with dwarfed Hooker's manzanita (Arctostaphylos hookeri ssp. hookeri) or Eastwood's manzanita (Arctostaphylos glandulosa); and (c) Monterey cypress (Cupressus macrocarpa) forest. The colonies in woodland settings are found under partial canopy in an open, primarily herbaceous understory shape. The Monterey Peninsula and northern Big Sur areas are influenced by a marine climate that is pronounced due to the upwelling of cool water from the Monterey submarine canyon. Rainfall is 40 to 50 centimeters per year, but summer fog drip is a primary source of moisture for Yadon's Piperia and other plants that would otherwise not be able to persist with such low precipitation. == History and conservation == Platanthera yadonii was named for Vern Yadon, former longtime director of the Pacific Grove Museum of Natural History. The Monterey Peninsula, where all colonies of Yadon's piperia occur, is recognized to have a high degree of species endemicism. Species with more northern ranges often reach their southern limits on the Peninsula; species with more southern affinities reach their northern limits there as well. On the Monterey Peninsula some taxa comprising habitat for P. yadonii, such as the coastal closed-cone pines and cypresses are relict stands, e.g. species that once extended more widely in the mesic climate of the late Pleistocene period, but then retreated to small pockets of cooler and wetter conditions along the coast ranges during the hotter, drier early Holocene period between 6000 and 2000 BC.Yadon's piperia, along with certain other threatened species in the northern California Floristic Province, has been designated as a species meriting protection by the U.S. Government, State of California, local governments and private conservation groups. These designations have led to blueprints for protection of Yadon's piperia in the form of official endangerment classifications and a species Recovery Plan, the latter promulgated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Even with all these efforts, the total current population is not necessarily above the minimum viable population without further elements of protection. The listing as a federally endangered species occurred in 1998, prompted by a study conducted by Earth Metrics for the city of Monterey, which found the colony in the Del Monte forest to be threatened by proposed land development. Subsequently, in 1995 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service acted on this new information regarding Yadon's piperia, and promulgated a notice of intent to classify the species as endangered. Monitoring populations of Yadon's piperia is challenging since each tuber does not produce emergent leaves or flowers in a given year. To complicate matters further, the plant can only be identified conclusively in its flowering stage, and yet, even when the plant leafs out, it may not necessarily produce a flower in a given year. Furthermore, by the time a flower is produced, the leaves have typically senesced; thus, a survey conducted during the flowering season will miss plants that have leafed out but not flowered. == See also == Platanthera elegans Hickman's potentilla Minimum viable population == References == == External links == Data related to Platanthera yadonii (Piperia yadonii) at Wikispecies Calflora: Piperia yadonii (Yadon's piperia, Yadon's rein orchid) USDA Plants Profile for Piperia yadonii (Yadon's piperia) Jepson eFlora: Piperia yadonii U.S.EPA endangered species listing detail for P. yadonii U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service species profile for P. yadonii Piperia yadonii — UC Photos gallery\",\n",

              " 'John Ferguson Godfrey, (born December 19, 1942) is a Canadian educator, journalist and former Member of Parliament. == Background == Godfrey was born in Toronto, Ontario. His father, Senator John Morrow Godfrey (June 28, 1912 – March 8, 2001), was a Canadian pilot, lawyer and politician. John Godfrey graduated from Upper Canada College in 1960. In 1961, he attended the Neuchâtel Junior College in Neuchâtel, Switzerland.In 1965, he received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Trinity College, University of Toronto and in 1967, he received a Master of Philosophy from Balliol College, Oxford and Doctor of Philosophy (DPhil) from St Antony\\'s College, Oxford in 1975. He worked as an economist, historian and journalist. In the mid-1970s Godfrey was a history professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax. He served as president of the University of King\\'s College from 1977-87. From 1987 to 1991 he was editor of the Financial Post. == Politics == He was elected to the House of Commons of Canada as the Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for the Toronto area riding of Don Valley West in the 1993 election, and was re-elected in each subsequent vote until his retirement from federal politics in 2008.During the 1995 Quebec referendum, Godfrey had an acquaintance perform a psychiatric evaluation of separatist leader Lucien Bouchard.In 1996, he and fellow Liberal MP Peter Milliken introduced the Godfrey–Milliken Bill a parody of the American Helms–Burton Act. The gesture received extensive media coverage including in the United States, where Godfrey was featured on the CBS program 60 Minutes. From 1996 to 2004, Godfrey served as a Parliamentary Secretary under Prime Minister Jean Chrétien. == Minister of State for Infrastructure and Communities == In 2003, Paul Martin succeeded Chrétien as Liberal leader and prime minister. Following the subsequent 2004 election, Godfrey, among other key Martin allies, was appointed to the Cabinet in the role of Minister of State for Infrastructure and Communities. In this role, he was primarily responsible for overseeing the \"New Deal for Cities\", Federation of Canadian Municipalities relationship, and other initiatives in Canadian federal-municipal relations. This role was considered a keystone of Martin\\'s industrial strategy. == Liberal leadership == On February 3, 2006, CBC Newsworld\\'s Don Newman announced on air that Godfrey was planning a run for the Liberal Party leadership. Godfrey declared his candidacy on Goldhawk Live on March 19, shortly after the rules and convention date were set. Media reaction was positive, but competed with coverage of Ashley MacIsaac, who declared his intention to run to the Halifax Daily News the next day. In the early stages of the campaign he was recurrently cited as exemplar of intellectualism in the race, being one of three former university professors in the running. Name-recognition remained a challenge, but Godfrey received plaudits in the Canadian blogosphere for his performance in the first all-candidates meeting at the Liberal Party of Alberta convention on April 8. On April 12, 2006, Godfrey announced his withdrawal from the race, due to concerns about his health. On October 20, 2006, Godfrey announced his support for Bob Rae for the federal Liberal leadership. He made the announcement at the National Press Club, on the occasion of a speech by Rae on the environment. == Leaving politics == Godfrey announced in November 2007 his intention to resign his parliamentary seat on July 1, 2008 and would leave earlier if an election were called before that date. He later delayed his resignation date until August 1. The Conservative Party alleged that the Liberals chose to delay the by-election for financial reasons though Godfrey\\'s office stated that the delay was due to a private members bill Godfrey had worked on not being given Royal Assent until June 26.On June 17, in a point of order following Question Period, Godfrey gave his resignation speech to the House of Commons. == Headmaster of the Toronto French School == John Godfrey left politics to become Headmaster of the Toronto French School, an independent school in the Lawrence Park area with two campuses in Toronto. He held the position from 2008 until resigning in June 2014.The Government of Ontario appointed John Godfrey Special Advisor for Climate Change and Chair of the Government\\'s Climate Action Group in March 2015, positions he held until June 2018. == References == == External links == John Godfrey – Parliament of Canada biography',\n",

The first issue of the newspaper was first published in January 1861 in an edition of 7000 copies.From 1861 to 1894 it was published by Julius Grégr; since 1874 it was the main newspaper of the Young Czech Party. The Grégr family owned and published the newspaper up until 1910; when it was transferred to the printing house Pražská akciová tiskárna founded by two other members of the Young Czech Party, Karel Kramář and Alois Rašín.In October 1917, brothers Josef Čapek and Karel Čapek joined the staff as writers, but they left in April 1921 when the paper shifted toward increasingly narrow nationalistic orientations. The paper was briefly suspended a few months before Czechoslovak Independence Day (28 October 1918). From 1918 to 1938 it was the main newspaper of National Democratic Party (Czechoslovakia) and the National Unification, both led by Karel Kramář. After the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia, it operated as the newspaper of National Partnership, the only political party that was allowed. In April 1941 it ceased its publishing. == Prominent Editors == Jan Neruda, Vitezslav Hálek, Karel Sladkovský, editor Josef Anýž, Karel Čapek, Chod Matthew, Josef Čapek, Viktor Dyk, Jindriska Konopásková, Jakub Arbes . == References ==',\n",

It was released direct-to-DVD on January 15, 2008. Cloverfield was released theatrically three days later on January 18, 2008. == Plot == The film takes place in Tokyo in 2003, where two reporters, Erin and Sarah Lynch, have arrived to document unusual seismic disturbances that have been picked up around Tokyo. The disturbances are originally thought to be aftershocks left over from a supposed massive earthquake on the Kanto Fault that occurred two years previously, causing hundreds of thousands of casualties and several hundred billion dollars in damage (possibly referencing the real-life Fukuoka earthquake or the Miyagi earthquake), although careful analysis of the evidence suggests otherwise. As time goes on, all of Tokyo begins to suffer from abnormal earth tremors similar to those registered in 2005. The tremors are found not to be caused by an earthquake, but by a gigantic octopus that has been dormant for centuries. It has since been awakened by mankind and now sees Tokyo as a new feeding-ground; the filmmakers document the catastrophe as it unfolds. It starts as Erin and Sarah are talking about filming Tokyo. The scene then switches to the interior of Erin\\'s car as the two drive to LAX, to catch their flight to Tokyo. In Tokyo they rent a hotel room, and, the next day, Sarah films Erin talking with the global warming minister. During the interview, an earthquake strikes and the scene again switches to the reporters in the basement of the environmental building. They find a survivor named Justin Robbins, and as they flee, they hear the sounds of panic and plane engines from a tunnel. Later, they find a mall, and another earthquake occurs. In the chaos, Justin is impaled by a pole as the reporters flee in panic. Some small text appears on the screen saying that tape #3 was damaged. As the reporters run toward a mall they find a woman (Aiko) and her grandfather, and they eat and sleep, Erin not realizing she had left the camera turned on. Then, another earthquake begins and kills the grandfather as the woman tells the reporters to flee. They hear the mall explode as they run away and soon find a building which they enter. They have gone upstairs when the building suddenly collapses. The reporters survive, but the collapse damages the camera lens. Night arrives and they see helicopters ready to save refugees, but a tentacle destroys them and proceeds to throw cars at the people, killing many of them. Panic ensues, and Sarah abandons Erin. A tentacle slams into the ground where Erin is and she is wounded. Additionally, the camera\\'s batteries run low. Sarah cries for Erin as the crash of a tentacle hitting the ground is heard, ending the film, which indicates that the reporters were crushed by the monster and were among the thousands, if not millions, killed. == Reception == The few reviews of Monster that have been posted online have been extremely negative. In an audio review, Scott Foy of Dread Central parodied the movie\\'s found footage premise, pretending that the abysmal film was slowly driving him insane. The review ended with Foy supposedly jumping out a window. (He later said that some listeners believed he actually had gone mad.) Foy named Monster the \"Worst Direct-to-DVD Horror Movie of 2008\" in a later podcast. Other reviewers called the film\\'s pacing \"horrendous\", and described the movie as \"terrible\" and \"astoundingly dull\". == See also == Cloverfield, another monster film released in the same year List of killer octopus films == References == == External links == Official website Monster at IMDb',\n",
              " 'The concerto delle donne (lit. \\'consort of ladies\\'; also concerto di donne or concerto delle (or di) dame) was a group of professional female singers in the late Italian Renaissance, primarily in the court of Ferrara, Italy. Renowned for their technical and artistic virtuosity, the ensemble was founded by Alfonso II, Duke of Ferrara, in 1580 and was active until the court was dissolved in 1597. Giacomo Vincenti, a music publisher, praised the women as \"virtuose giovani\" (young virtuosas), echoing the sentiments of contemporaneous diarists and commentators.The origins of the ensemble lay in an amateur group of high-placed courtiers who performed for each other within the context of the Duke\\'s informal musica secreta (lit. \\'secret music\\') in the 1570s. The ensemble evolved into an all-female group of professional musicians, the concerto delle donne, who performed formal concerts for members of the inner circle of the court and important visitors. Their signature style of florid, highly ornamented singing brought prestige to Ferrara and inspired composers of the time. The concerto delle donne revolutionized the role of women in professional music, and continued the tradition of the Este court as a musical center. Word of the ladies\\' ensemble spread across Italy, inspiring imitations in the powerful courts of the Medici and Orsini. The founding of the concerto delle donne was the most important event in secular Italian music in the late sixteenth century; the musical innovations established in the court were important in the development of the madrigal, and eventually the seconda pratica. == History == === Formation === At the court in Ferrara, a collection of ladies skilled in music inspired the composer Luzzasco Luzzaschi and caught the interest of Alfonso II d\\'Este, Duke of Ferrara. This group, which led to the formation of the concerto delle donne (lit. \\'consort of ladies\\'), performed within the context of the Duke\\'s musica secreta (lit. \\'secret music\\'), a regular series of chamber music concerts performed for a private audience. This preliminary group was originally made up of talented but amateur members of the court: the sisters Lucrezia and Isabella Bendidio, as well as Leonora Sanvitale, and Vittoria Bentivoglio. They were joined by bass Giulio Cesare Brancaccio, who was brought to the court in 1577 for his singing abilities. The preliminary ensemble was active throughout the 1570s, and its membership solidified in 1577. Only later did professionals replace these original singers. The Duke did not announce the creation of a professional, all-female ensemble; instead, the group infiltrated and gradually dominated the musica secreta, so that after the dismissal of Brancaccio for insubordination in 1583, no more male members of the musica secreta were hired. Even when Brancaccio was performing with the consort it was referred to as a ladies\\' ensemble, because women singing together was the most exciting aspect of the group. This new ensemble, the concerto delle donne, was created by the Duke in part to amuse his young new wife, Margherita Gonzaga d\\'Este (she was only fourteen when they wed in 1579), and in part to help the Duke achieve his artistic goals for the court. According to Grana, a contemporary correspondent, \"Signora Machiavella [Lucrezia], Signora Isabella, and Signora Vittoria have abandoned the field, having lost the backing of Luzzaschi\". The first recorded performance by the professional ladies was on November 20, 1580; by the 1581 carnival season, they were performing together regularly.This new \"consort of ladies\" was viewed as an extraordinary and novel phenomenon; most witnesses did not connect the second period of the concerto delle donne with the group of ladies who sang in the musica secreta. However, modern musicologists now view the earlier group as a crucial part of the creation and development of the social and vocal genre of the concerto delle donne. === Roster and duties === The most prominent member of the new ensemble was Laura Peverara, followed by Livia d\\'Arco and Anna Guarini, daughter of the prolific poet Giovanni Battista Guarini. Giovanni wrote poems for many of the madrigals which were set for the ensemble, and choreographed scenes for the balletto delle donne. Judith Tick believes Tarquinia Molza sang with the group, but Anthony Newcomb says she was involved solely as an advisor and instructor. Whether Tarquinia Molza ever performed with them or not, she was ousted from any role in the group after her affair with the composer Giaches de Wert came to light in 1589. Luzzasco Luzzaschi directed and composed music to showcase the ensemble, and accompanied them on the harpsichord. Ippolito Fiorini was the maestro di capella, in charge of the entire court\\'s musical activities. In addition to his duties to the overall court, he accompanied the concerto on the lute. Vittorio Baldini was brought to the court as ducal music printer in 1582.The singers of the second era of the concerto delle donne were officially ladies-in-waiting of Duchess Margherita Gonzaga d\\'Este, but were hired primarily as singers. Peverara\\'s musical abilities prompted the Duke to specifically ask his wife Margherita to bring Peverara from Mantua as part of her retinue. The new singers played instruments, including the lute, harp, and viol, but focused their energies on developing vocal virtuosity. This skill became highly prized in the mid-sixteenth century, beginning with basses like Brancaccio, but by the end of the century virtuosic bass singing went out of style, and higher voices came into vogue. The ladies\\' musical duties included performing with the duchess\\' balletto delle donne, a group of female dancers who frequently crossdressed. Despite their upper-class background, the singers would not have been welcomed into the court\\'s inner circle had they not been such skilled performers. D\\'Arco belonged to the nobility, but a minor family only. Peverara was the daughter of a wealthy merchant, and Molza came from a prominent family of artists.The women performed up to six hours a day, either singing their own florid repertoire from memory, sight-reading from partbooks, or participating in the balletti as singers and dancers. Thomasin LaMay posits that the women of the concerti delle donne provided sexual favors for members of the court, but there is no evidence for this, and the circumstances of their marriages and dowries argues against this interpretation. The women were paid salaries and received other benefits, such as dowries and apartments in the ducal palace. Peverara received 300 scudi a year and lodging in the ducal palace for herself, her husband, and her mother – as well as a dowry of 10,000 scudi upon her marriage.Despite having married three times in the hopes of producing an heir, Alfonso II died in 1597 without issue, legitimate or otherwise. His cousin Cesare inherited the Duchy, but the city of Ferrara, which was legally a Papal fief, was annexed to the Papal States in 1598 through a combination of \"firm diplomacy and unscrupulous pressure\" by Pope Clement VIII. The Este court had to abandon Ferrara in disarray and the concerto delle donne was disbanded. == Music == The greatest musical innovation of the concerto delle donne was the multiplication of the ornamented upper voices, from one voice singing diminutions above an instrumental accompaniment to two or three voices singing varying diminutions at once. This practice, which listeners found remarkable, was imitated by many composers, including Carlo Gesualdo, Luca Marenzio and Claudio Monteverdi.These composers wrote music either inspired by the concerto delle donne or specifically for them. Such works are characterized by a high tessitura, a virtuosic and florid style, and a wide range. Lodovico Agostini\\'s third book of madrigals was perhaps the first publication fully dedicated to the new singing style. Agostini dedicated songs to Guarini, Peverara, and Luzzaschi. Gesualdo wrote music for the group in 1594 while visiting Ferrara to marry the Duke\\'s niece Leonora d\\'Este. De Wert\\'s Seventh Book of Madrigals à 5 and Marenzio\\'s First Book à 6 were the first true musical monuments to the new concerto delle donne. Monteverdi\\'s Canzonette a tre voci was probably influenced by the \"Ladies of Ferrara\". Although the only works clearly intended for or inspired by the concerto delle donne were works for multiple high voices executing written-out diminutions, in practice concerts with the concerto delle donne included the older style of solo ornamented madrigals with instrumental accompaniment. Peverara was singularly lauded for her skill in this genre. Works written for the concerto delle donne were not limited to music: Torquato Tasso and G.B. Guarini wrote poems dedicated to the ladies in the concerto, some of which were later set by composers. Tasso wrote over seventy-five poems to Peverara alone.Luzzaschi\\'s book of madrigals for one, two, and three sopranos with keyboard accompaniment, published in 1601, comprises works written throughout the 1580s. This music may have been kept back from publication in order to maintain the secrecy of Alfonso\\'s musica secreta, and to maintain control over it. Newcomb considers this publication the exemplar of the ladies\\' signature musical style. In 1584, Alessandro Striggio, responding to requests from Francesco I de\\' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, described the ladies and composed pieces imitating their style so that Francesco could start his own concerto delle donne. Striggio mentioned an ornamented four voice madrigal for three sopranos and a dialogue with imitative diminutions for two sopranos. He added that he had forgotten the intabulation for the madrigal in Mantua, and noted that the skilled singer Giulio Caccini could play the bass part on either lute or harpsichord. This indicates both that male singers were probably not used after Brancaccio, and that instrumental accompaniments were a common and acceptable means of filling in the counterpoint.The output of the ducal printer, Baldini, consisted largely of music written for the concerto delle donne, including the works of the foremost madrigalists: Luzzaschi, Gesualdo, and Alfonso Fontanelli. His first publication for the Duke was Il lauro secco (1582), which was followed by Il lauro verde (1583), both containing music by the leading composers of Rome and Northern Italy. Music in honor of the concerto was printed as far away as Venice, with Paolo Virchi\\'s First Book à 5, published by Giacomo Vincenti and Ricciardo Amadino containing the madrigal which begins SeGU\\'ARINAscer LAURA e prenda LARCO / Amor soave e dolce / Ch\\'ogni cor duro MOLCE. This capitalization is in the original, clearly spelling out the equivalent of the names Anna Guarini, Laura Peverara, Livia d\\'Arco, and Tarquinia Molza.With the obvious exception of Brancaccio, all the singers in the concerto were female sopranos. Although the music written for the concerto focused on high voices, there is no evidence that the ensemble used either castrati or falsettists. This fact is surprising, considering that castrati were shortly to become the biggest stars of a new art form, opera. In 1607, Monteverdi\\'s Orfeo featured four castrato roles out of a cast of nine, showing the new dominance of this vocal type. It also contrasts with Margherita\\'s father\\'s court, where Guglielmo Gonzaga actively sought out eunuchs.Polyphonic arrangements called for the women to sing diminutions (melodic divisions of longer notes) and other ornaments in consort. Diminutions were traditionally improvised in performance. However, to coordinate their voices, they transcribed and rehearsed the music in advance, transforming these improvisations into highly developed musical forms that composers would emulate. The singers may have used the more traditional practice in their solo repertoire, performing ornaments extemporaneously. Specific ornaments used by the concerto delle donne, mentioned in a source from 1581, were such popular sixteenth-century devices as passaggi (division of a long note into many shorter notes, usually stepwise), cadenze (decoration of the penultimate note, sometimes quite elaborate), and tirate (rapid scales). Accenti (connection of two longer notes, using dotted rhythms), a staple of early Baroque music, are absent from the list. In 1592 Caccini claimed that Alfonso II asked him to teach his ladies the new accenti and passaggi styles. === Styles === There are two separate styles of madrigals written for and inspired by the concerto delle donne. The first is the \"luxuriant\" style of the 1580s. The second is music in the style of the seconda pratica, written in the 1590s. Luzzaschi wrote music in both of these styles. The style of the earlier period, as exemplified in the works of Luzzaschi, involves the use of madrigal texts written by poets within the Ferrarese sphere, such as Tasso and G.B. Guarini. These poems tend to be short and witty with single sections. Musically, Luzzaschi\\'s works are highly sectionalized and based on melodic themes, rather than harmonic structures. Luzzaschi lessens the sectionalizing effect of his compositional techniques by weakening cadences. His tendency to reiterate melodies in different voices, including the bass voice, leads to tonal creations which are sometimes bewildering. These aspects make Luzzaschi\\'s music much more polyphonic than Monteverdi\\'s later compositions, and thus more conservative; however, Luzzaschi\\'s use of jarring melodic leaps and harmonic dissonance are individualistic. These dissonances, which contrast sharply with the careful treatment of dissonance during most of the 16th century, is closely connected with the ornamented polyphonic madrigals of the concerto delle donne. In Giovanni Artusi\\'s socratic dialogue, the character defending Monteverdi connects haphazard treatment of dissonance with ornamental singing. === Performance === The concerto delle donne transformed the musica secreta. In the past, members of the audience would perform, and performers would become audience members. During the ascendancy of the concerto delle donne the roles within the musica secreta became fixed, as did the roster of those who performed for the Duke\\'s pleasure every night.The elite, hand-selected audience members favored with admission to performances by the concerto delle donne demanded diversions and entertainment beyond the pleasures of beautiful music alone. During the concerts, members of the concerto\\'s audience would sometimes play cards. Orazio Urbani, ambassador of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, having waited several years to see the concerto, complained that he was forced not only to play cards, distracting him from the performance, but also simultaneously admire and praise the women\\'s music to their patron Alfonso. After at least one concert, to continue the entertainment, a dwarf couple danced. Alfonso was not as interested in these peripheral entertainments, and in one instance excused himself from the party to go sit under a tree to listen to the ladies, and follow along with the madrigal texts and musical scores, including embellishments, which were made available to listeners. == Influence == The concerto delle donne was a revolutionary musical establishment that helped effect a shift in women\\'s role in music; its success took women from obscurity to \"the apex of the profession\". Women were openly brought to court to train as professional musicians, and by 1600, a woman could have a viable career as a musician, independent of her husband or father. New women\\'s ensembles inspired by the concerto delle donne resulted in more positions for women as professional singers and more music for them to perform.Despite the dissolution of the court in 1597, the musical style which was inspired by the concerto delle donne spread throughout Europe, and remained prominent for almost fifty years. The concerto delle donne was so influential and often imitated that it became a cliché of northern Italian courts. It heavily influenced the development of the madrigal and eventually the seconda practica. The group\\' brought Alfonso and his court international prestige, as the ladies\\' reputation spread throughout Italy and southern Germany. It functioned as a powerful tool of propaganda, projecting an image of strength and affluence.Having seen the concerto delle donne in Ferrara, Caccini created a rival group made up of his family and a pupil. This ensemble was sponsored by the Medici, and traveled as far abroad as Paris to perform for Marie de\\' Medici. Francesca Caccini had much success composing and singing in the style of the concerto delle donne. Beginning in 1585, rival groups were created in Florence by the Medici, Rome by the Orsini, and Mantua by the Gonzaga. There was even a rival group in Ferrara based in the Castello Estense, the very palace where the concerto delle donne performed. This group was formed by Alfonso\\'s sister Lucrezia d\\'Este, Duchess of Urbino. She had lived at the Este court since 1576, and shortly after Margherita\\'s marriage to Alfonso in 1579, Alfonso and his henchmen killed Lucrezia\\'s lover. Lucrezia was unhappy about being replaced as the matron of the house by Margherita, and upset by the murder of her lover, leading to her desire to be separate from the rest of her family during her evening entertainments.Barbara Strozzi was among the last composers and performers in this style, which by the mid-seventeenth century was considered archaic. == Notes == == Citations == == References == Grove sources',\n",
              " 'In finance, the rule of 72, the rule of 70 and the rule of 69.3 are methods for estimating an investment\\'s doubling time. The rule number (e.g., 72) is divided by the interest percentage per period (usually years) to obtain the approximate number of periods required for doubling. Although scientific calculators and spreadsheet programs have functions to find the accurate doubling time, the rules are useful for mental calculations and when only a basic calculator is available.These rules apply to exponential growth and are therefore used for compound interest as opposed to simple interest calculations. They can also be used for decay to obtain a halving time. The choice of number is mostly a matter of preference: 69 is more accurate for continuous compounding, while 72 works well in common interest situations and is more easily divisible. There are a number of variations to the rules that improve accuracy. For periodic compounding, the exact doubling time for an interest rate of r percent per period is t = ln \\u2061 ( 2 ) ln \\u2061 ( 1 + r / 100 ) ≈ 72 r {\\\\displaystyle t={\\\\frac {\\\\ln(2)}{\\\\ln(1+r/100)}}\\\\approx {\\\\frac {72}{r}}} ,where t is the number of periods required. The formula above can be used for more than calculating the doubling time. If one wants to know the tripling time, for example, replace the constant 2 in the numerator with 3. As another example, if one wants to know the number of periods it takes for the initial value to rise by 50%, replace the constant 2 with 1.5. == Using the rule to estimate compounding periods == To estimate the number of periods required to double an original investment, divide the most convenient \"rule-quantity\" by the expected growth rate, expressed as a percentage. For instance, if you were to invest $100 with compounding interest at a rate of 9% per annum, the rule of 72 gives 72/9 = 8 years required for the investment to be worth $200; an exact calculation gives ln(2)/ln(1+0.09) = 8.0432 years.Similarly, to determine the time it takes for the value of money to halve at a given rate, divide the rule quantity by that rate. To determine the time for money\\'s buying power to halve, financiers divide the rule-quantity by the inflation rate. Thus at 3.5% inflation using the rule of 70, it should take approximately 70/3.5 = 20 years for the value of a unit of currency to halve. To estimate the impact of additional fees on financial policies (e.g., mutual fund fees and expenses, loading and expense charges on variable universal life insurance investment portfolios), divide 72 by the fee. For example, if the Universal Life policy charges an annual 3% fee over and above the cost of the underlying investment fund, then the total account value will be cut to 50% in 72 / 3 = 24 years, and then to 25% of the value in 48 years, compared to holding exactly the same investment outside the policy. == Choice of rule == The value 72 is a convenient choice of numerator, since it has many small divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, and 12. It provides a good approximation for annual compounding, and for compounding at typical rates (from 6% to 10%); the approximations are less accurate at higher interest rates. For continuous compounding, 69 gives accurate results for any rate, since ln(2) is about 69.3%; see derivation below. Since daily compounding is close enough to continuous compounding, for most purposes 69, 69.3 or 70 are better than 72 for daily compounding. For lower annual rates than those above, 69.3 would also be more accurate than 72. For higher annual rates, 78 is more accurate. Note: The most accurate value on each row is in italics, and the most accurate of the simpler rules in bold. == History == An early reference to the rule is in the Summa de arithmetica (Venice, 1494. Fol. 181, n. 44) of Luca Pacioli (1445–1514). He presents the rule in a discussion regarding the estimation of the doubling time of an investment, but does not derive or explain the rule, and it is thus assumed that the rule predates Pacioli by some time. A voler sapere ogni quantità a tanto per 100 l\\'anno, in quanti anni sarà tornata doppia tra utile e capitale, tieni per regola 72, a mente, il quale sempre partirai per l\\'interesse, e quello che ne viene, in tanti anni sarà raddoppiato. Esempio: Quando l\\'interesse è a 6 per 100 l\\'anno, dico che si parta 72 per 6; ne vien 12, e in 12 anni sarà raddoppiato il capitale. (emphasis added). Roughly translated: In wanting to know of any capital, at a given yearly percentage, in how many years it will double adding the interest to the capital, keep as a rule [the number] 72 in mind, which you will always divide by the interest, and what results, in that many years it will be doubled. Example: When the interest is 6 percent per year, I say that one divides 72 by 6; 12 results, and in 12 years the capital will be doubled. == Adjustments for higher accuracy == For higher rates, a larger numerator would be better (e.g., for 20%, using 76 to get 3.8 years would be only about 0.002 off, where using 72 to get 3.6 would be about 0.2 off). This is because, as above, the rule of 72 is only an approximation that is accurate for interest rates from 6% to 10%. For every three percentage points away from 8%, the value of 72 could be adjusted by 1: t ≈ 72 + ( r − 8 ) / 3 r {\\\\displaystyle t\\\\approx {\\\\frac {72+(r-8)/3}{r}}} or, for the same result: t ≈ 70 + ( r − 2 ) / 3 r {\\\\displaystyle t\\\\approx {\\\\frac {70+(r-2)/3}{r}}} Both of these equations simplify to: t ≈ 208 3 r + 1 3 {\\\\displaystyle t\\\\approx {\\\\frac {208}{3r}}+{\\\\frac {1}{3}}} Note that 208 3 {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\frac {208}{3}}} is quite close to 69.3. === E-M rule === The Eckart–McHale second-order rule (the E-M rule) provides a multiplicative correction for the rule of 69.3 that is very accurate for rates from 0% to 20%, whereas the rule is normally only accurate at the lowest end of interest rates, from 0% to about 5%. To compute the E-M approximation, multiply the rule of 69.3 result by 200/(200−r) as follows: t ≈ 69.3 r × 200 200 − r {\\\\displaystyle t\\\\approx {\\\\frac {69.3}{r}}\\\\times {\\\\frac {200}{200-r}}} .For example, if the interest rate is 18%, the rule of 69.3 gives t = 3.85 years, which the E-M rule multiplies by 200 182 {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\frac {200}{182}}} (i.e. 200/ (200−18)) to give a doubling time of 4.23 years. As the actual doubling time at this rate is 4.19 years, the E-M rule thus gives a closer approximation than the rule of 72. To obtain a similar correction for the rule of 70 or 72, one of the numerators can be set and the other adjusted to keep their product approximately the same. The E-M rule could thus be written also as t ≈ 70 r × 198 200 − r {\\\\displaystyle t\\\\approx {\\\\frac {70}{r}}\\\\times {\\\\frac {198}{200-r}}} or t ≈ 72 r × 192 200 − r {\\\\displaystyle t\\\\approx {\\\\frac {72}{r}}\\\\times {\\\\frac {192}{200-r}}} In these variants, the multiplicative correction becomes 1 respectively for r=2 and r=8, the values for which the rules of 70 and 72 are most accurate. === Padé approximant === The third-order Padé approximant gives a more accurate answer over an even larger range of r, but it has a slightly more complicated formula: t ≈ 69.3 r × 600 + 4 r 600 + r {\\\\displaystyle t\\\\approx {\\\\frac {69.3}{r}}\\\\times {\\\\frac {600+4r}{600+r}}} which simplifies to: t ≈ 207900 + 1386 r 3000 r + 5 r 2 {\\\\displaystyle t\\\\approx {\\\\frac {207900+1386r}{3000r+5r^{2}}}} == Derivation == === Periodic compounding === For periodic compounding, future value is given by: F V = P V ⋅ ( 1 + r ) t {\\\\displaystyle FV=PV\\\\cdot (1+r)^{t}} where P V {\\\\displaystyle PV} is the present value, t {\\\\displaystyle t} is the number of time periods, and r {\\\\displaystyle r} stands for the interest rate per time period. The future value is double the present value when: F V = P V ⋅ 2 {\\\\displaystyle FV=PV\\\\cdot 2} which is the following condition: ( 1 + r ) t = 2 {\\\\displaystyle (1+r)^{t}=2\\\\,} This equation is easily solved for t {\\\\displaystyle t} : ln \\u2061 ( ( 1 + r ) t ) = ln \\u2061 2 t ln \\u2061 ( 1 + r ) = ln \\u2061 2 t = ln \\u2061 2 ln \\u2061 ( 1 + r ) {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\begin{array}{ccc}\\\\ln((1+r)^{t})&=&\\\\ln 2\\\\\\\\t\\\\ln(1+r)&=&\\\\ln 2\\\\\\\\t&=&{\\\\frac {\\\\ln 2}{\\\\ln(1+r)}}\\\\end{array}}} A simple rearrangement shows: ln \\u2061 2 ln \\u2061 ( 1 + r ) = ( ln \\u2061 2 r ) ( r ln \\u2061 ( 1 + r ) ) {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\frac {\\\\ln {2}}{\\\\ln {(1+r)}}}={\\\\bigg (}{\\\\frac {\\\\ln 2}{r}}{\\\\bigg )}{\\\\bigg (}{\\\\frac {r}{\\\\ln(1+r)}}{\\\\bigg )}} If r is small, then ln(1 + r) approximately equals r (this is the first term in the Taylor series). That is, the latter factor grows slowly when r {\\\\displaystyle r} is close to zero. Call this latter factor f ( r ) = r ln \\u2061 ( 1 + r ) {\\\\displaystyle f(r)={\\\\frac {r}{\\\\ln(1+r)}}} . The function f ( r ) {\\\\displaystyle f(r)} is shown to be accurate in the approximation of t {\\\\displaystyle t} for a small, positive interest rate when r = .08 {\\\\displaystyle r=.08} (see derivation below). f ( .08 ) ≈ 1.03949 {\\\\displaystyle f(.08)\\\\approx 1.03949} , and we therefore approximate time t {\\\\displaystyle t} as: t = ( ln \\u2061 2 r ) f ( .08 ) ≈ .72 r {\\\\displaystyle t={\\\\bigg (}{\\\\frac {\\\\ln 2}{r}}{\\\\bigg )}f(.08)\\\\approx {\\\\frac {.72}{r}}} Written as a percentage: .72 r = 72 100 r {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\frac {.72}{r}}={\\\\frac {72}{100r}}} This approximation increases in accuracy as the compounding of interest becomes continuous (see derivation below). 100 r {\\\\displaystyle 100r} is r {\\\\displaystyle r} written as a percentage. In order to derive the more precise adjustments presented above, it is noted that ln \\u2061 ( 1 + r ) {\\\\displaystyle \\\\ln(1+r)\\\\,} is more closely approximated by r − r 2 2 {\\\\displaystyle r-{\\\\frac {r^{2}}{2}}} (using the second term in the Taylor series). 0.693 r − r 2 / 2 {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\frac {0.693}{r-r^{2}/2}}} can then be further simplified by Taylor approximations: 0.693 r − r 2 / 2 = 69.3 R − R 2 / 200 = 69.3 R 1 1 − R / 200 ≈ 69.3 ( 1 + R / 200 ) R = 69.3 R + 69.3 200 = 69.3 R + 0.3465 {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\begin{array}{ccc}{\\\\frac {0.693}{r-r^{2}/2}}&=&{\\\\frac {69.3}{R-R^{2}/200}}\\\\\\\\&&\\\\\\\\&=&{\\\\frac {69.3}{R}}{\\\\frac {1}{1-R/200}}\\\\\\\\&&\\\\\\\\&\\\\approx &{\\\\frac {69.3(1+R/200)}{R}}\\\\\\\\&&\\\\\\\\&=&{\\\\frac {69.3}{R}}+{\\\\frac {69.3}{200}}\\\\\\\\&&\\\\\\\\&=&{\\\\frac {69.3}{R}}+0.3465\\\\end{array}}} Replacing the \"R\" in R/200 on the third line with 7.79 gives 72 on the numerator. This shows that the rule of 72 is most accurate for periodically compounded interests around 8%. Similarly, replacing the \"R\" in R/200 on the third line with 2.02 gives 70 on the numerator, showing the rule of 70 is most accurate for periodically compounded interests around 2%. Alternatively, the E-M rule is obtained if the second-order Taylor approximation is used directly. === Continuous compounding === For continuous compounding, the derivation is simpler and yields a more accurate rule: ( e r ) p = 2 e r p = 2 ln \\u2061 e r p = ln \\u2061 2 r p = ln \\u2061 2 p = ln \\u2061 2 r p ≈ 0.693147 r {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\begin{array}{ccc}(e^{r})^{p}&=&2\\\\\\\\e^{rp}&=&2\\\\\\\\\\\\ln e^{rp}&=&\\\\ln 2\\\\\\\\rp&=&\\\\ln 2\\\\\\\\p&=&{\\\\frac {\\\\ln 2}{r}}\\\\\\\\&&\\\\\\\\p&\\\\approx &{\\\\frac {0.693147}{r}}\\\\end{array}}} == See also == Exponential growth Time value of money Interest Discount Rule of 16 Rule of three (statistics) == References == == External links == The Scales Of 70 – extends the rule of 72 beyond fixed-rate growth to variable rate compound growth including positive and negative rates.',\n",
              " 'Preservation Action is an American 501(c)4 non-profit historic preservation advocacy organization. Preservation Action was created in 1974 to serve as the national grassroots lobby for historic preservation. The organization seeks to make historic preservation a national priority by advocating to all branches of the federal government for sound preservation policy and programs through a grassroots constituency of hundreds of members from throughout the United States. Preservation Action provides information and training, and encourages direct contact with elected representatives, with National Historic Preservation Advocacy Week being the highlight of advocacy and outreach efforts each year.Preservation Action\\'s offices are in the Christian Heurich Mansion in Washington, D.C., though it has representatives across the country. == History == Preservation Action came about after the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966. Early in the 1970s, preservation leaders realized that achieving their goals required substantial increases in federal support. This included especially the need for appropriations for federal-state preservation programs, changes in laws and regulations, and an understanding of the U.S. Congress and the federal government of the benefits of historic preservation. Preservation Action proved instrumental in the passage of various laws and amendments, including the Tax Reform Act of 1976. Following the success of these early advocacy efforts, the focus shifted slightly to helping local organizations advocate for preservation in their own communities and states as well as continuing to lobby Congress for increased funding for federal preservation projects and agencies.The success of Preservation Action at the federal level, inspired the establishment of enhanced preservation lobbying efforts at the state level. Such was the case with the establishment of Connecticut Preservation Action in 1979, to overturn a newly enacted law that would have crippled the state\\'s National Register program.In the 1980s preservationists were increasingly interested in the \\'business\\' of preservation\\'. Initiatives like the Main Street Program, established by the National Trust for Historic Preservation in 1980, helped to focus efforts to improve historic downtown areas and commercial districts throughout the United States. Into this milieu came Preservation Action, that along with the National Trust for Historic Preservation, served as an important advocate for historic preservation at the federal level.With improved incentives for historic preservation in the form of tax credits and other programs, the focus of urban projects shifted dramatically from demolition to rehabilitation. Nellie Longsworth, founding member and President of Preservation Action for twenty-two years, explained: \"All kinds of things have been tried to stop the deterioration of downtowns. The first program that ever really worked was the investment tax credit.\" With the unprecedented growth in historic preservation activities, Preservation Action cemented its role as a rallying point for the private historic preservation community at the national level, along with the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Sources credit this coming together of forces in support of historic preservation, and Longsworth especially. Arthur P. Ziegler Jr., wrote \"Never before or since have we seen preservation activities carried out so diligently by so many with such excellent results.\"In more recent decades, federal programs such as Save America\\'s Treasures and Preserve America have brought resources to the front lines of where preservation work is being done in communities. These same programs, despite their effectiveness, were threatened by cutbacks in funding in the present fiscal environment. Preservation Action has always and continues to play an important role in advocating for these federal programs to support historic preservation at the state and local level. In 2015, Preservation Action started to conduct monthly calls with statewide organizations to better connect states to the legislative efforts happening at the federal level, as well as, connecting Preservation Action the legislative efforts happening at the state and local level.In 2016, prior to the November Congressional elections, Preservation Action conducted a Federal Candidate Historic Preservation Survey. Preservation Action conducted a nationwide historic preservation survey of all candidates running for the U.S House and U.S Senate. The survey gauged candidates on their support of a number of issues important to preservationists, like the Historic Preservation Fund and Federal Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit program. == Current activities == Preservation Action has several existing programs and activities to advance the cause of historic preservation today. A few of these follow. === Legislative Update === The Legislative Update is an email sent out regularly on a weekly basis to Preservation Action members. Updates on spending bills and legislation affecting preservation are included each week. Special announcements are made and upcoming events are highlighted. === National Historic Preservation Advocacy Week === This event, usually held in March of each year, provides an opportunity for representatives from participating states to come and lobby their members of Congress. The first day provides a general overview of major issues affecting preservation. The second day is filled with Capitol Hill visits. == Leadership == Former Congressman Russ Carnahan is President of Preservation Action. He is responsible for the leadership of the organization, and furthering the member-driven legislative agenda in Congress through direct lobbying and/or through an active membership and national partners. He is supported by a staff in the preparation of educational materials and weekly legislative updates. The Board of Directors plays an active role in the operation of Preservation Action. An executive Committee with a Chair, several Vice Chairs, Secretary, and Treasurer assists in managing the organization. == Membership == To fulfill its mission, and to protect our nation\\'s preservation program, Preservation Action relies on the support of preservation advocates across the country. Now more than ever, with threats not only to preservation funding but to preservation policy, Preservation Action provides a strong, unified, and educated voice.

              " 'A fuel cell vehicle (FCV) or fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) is an electric vehicle that uses a fuel cell, sometimes in combination with a small battery or supercapacitor, to power its onboard electric motor. Fuel cells in vehicles generate electricity generally using oxygen from the air and compressed hydrogen. Most fuel cell vehicles are classified as zero-emissions vehicles that emit only water and heat. As compared with internal combustion vehicles, hydrogen vehicles centralize pollutants at the site of the hydrogen production, where hydrogen is typically derived from reformed natural gas. Transporting and storing hydrogen may also create pollutants. Fuel cells have been used in various kinds of vehicles including forklifts, especially in indoor applications where their clean emissions are important to air quality, and in space applications. Fuel cells are being developed and tested in trucks, buses, boats, ships, motorcycles and bicycles, among other kinds of vehicles. The first road vehicle powered by a fuel cell was the Chevrolet Electrovan, introduced by General Motors in 1966. The Toyota FCHV and Honda FCX, which began leasing on December 2, 2002, became the world\\'s first government-certified commercial fuel cell vehicles, and the Honda FCX Clarity, which began leasing in 2008, was the world\\'s first fuel cell vehicle designed for mass production rather than adapting an existing model. In 2013, Hyundai Motors began production of the Hyundai ix35 FCEV, claimed to be the world\\'s first mass-produced fuel cell electric vehicle, which was subsequently introduced to the market as a lease-only vehicle. In 2014, Toyota began selling the Toyota Mirai, the world\\'s first dedicated fuel cell vehicle.As of December 2020, 31,225 passenger FCEVs powered with hydrogen had been sold worldwide. As of 2021, there were only two models of fuel cell cars publicly available in select markets: the Toyota Mirai (2014-present) and the Hyundai Nexo (2018–present). The Honda Clarity was produced from 2016 to 2021, when it was discontinued. As of 2020, there was limited hydrogen infrastructure, with fewer than fifty hydrogen fueling stations for automobiles publicly available in the U.S. Critics doubt whether hydrogen will be efficient or cost-effective for automobiles, as compared with other zero emission technologies, and in 2019, The Motley Fool opined: \"What\\'s tough to dispute is that the hydrogen fuel cell dream is all but dead for the passenger vehicle market.\" == Description and purpose of fuel cells in vehicles == All fuel cells are made up of three parts: an electrolyte, an anode and a cathode. In principle, a hydrogen fuel cell functions like a battery, producing electricity, which can run an electric motor. Instead of requiring recharging, however, the fuel cell can be refilled with hydrogen. Different types of fuel cells include polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) Fuel Cells, direct methanol fuel cells, phosphoric acid fuel cells, molten carbonate fuel cells, solid oxide fuel cells, reformed methanol fuel cell and Regenerative Fuel Cells. == History == The concept of the fuel cell was first demonstrated by Humphry Davy in 1801, but the invention of the first working fuel cell is credited to William Grove, a chemist, lawyer, and physicist. Grove\\'s experiments with what he called a \"gas voltaic battery\" proved in 1842 that an electric current could be produced by an electrochemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen over a platinum catalyst. English engineer Francis Thomas Bacon expanded on Grove\\'s work, creating and demonstrating various alkaline fuel cells from 1939 to 1959.The first modern fuel cell vehicle was a modified Allis-Chalmers farm tractor, fitted with a 15 kilowatt fuel cell, around 1959. The Cold War Space Race drove further development of fuel cell technology. Project Gemini tested fuel cells to provide electrical power during crewed space missions. Fuel cell development continued with the Apollo Program. The electrical power systems in the Apollo capsules and lunar modules used alkali fuel cells. In 1966, General Motors developed the first fuel cell road vehicle, the Chevrolet Electrovan. It had a PEM fuel cell, a range of 120 miles and a top speed of 70 mph. There were only two seats, as the fuel cell stack and large tanks of hydrogen and oxygen took up the rear portion of the van. Only one was built, as the project was deemed cost-prohibitive.General Electric and others continued working on PEM fuel cells in the 1970s. Fuel cell stacks were still limited principally to space applications in the 1980s, including the Space Shuttle. However, the closure of the Apollo Program sent many industry experts to private companies. By the 1990s, automobile manufacturers were interested in fuel cell applications, and demonstration vehicles were readied. In 2001, the first 700 Bar (10000 PSI) hydrogen tanks were demonstrated, reducing the size of the fuel tanks that could be used in vehicles and extending the range. == Applications == There are fuel cell vehicles for all modes of transport. The most prevalent fuel cell vehicles are cars, buses, forklifts and material handling vehicles. === Automobiles === Honda established the world\\'s first fuel cell vehicle dealer network in 2008, and at the time was the only company able to lease hydrogen fuel cell vehicles to private customers. The Honda FCX Clarity was introduced in 2008 for leasing by customers in Japan and Southern California and discontinued by 2015. From 2008 to 2014, Honda leased a total of 45 FCX units in the US. Over 20 other FCEV prototypes and demonstration cars were released in that time period, including the GM HydroGen4, and Mercedes-Benz F-Cell. The Hyundai ix35 FCEV Fuel Cell vehicle was available for lease from 2014 to 2018, when 54 units were leased. In 2018, Hyundai introduced the Nexo.Sales of the Toyota Mirai to customers began in Japan in December 2014. Most of the initial customers were expected to be governments and corporations, not individuals. Pricing started at ¥6,700,000 (~US$57,400) before taxes and a government incentive of ¥2,000,000 (~US$19,600). Former European Parliament President Pat Cox estimated that Toyota initially would lose about $100,000 on each Mirai sold. As of December 2017, global sales totaled 5,300 Mirais. The top selling markets were the U.S. with 2,900 units, Japan with 2,100 and Europe with 200.In 2015, Toyota announced that it would offer all 5,680 patents related to hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and hydrogen fuel cell charging station technology, which it has been researching for over 20 years, to its competitors free of charge in order to stimulate the market for hydrogen-powered vehicles.The Honda Clarity Fuel Cell was produced from 2016 to 2021. The 2017 Clarity had the highest combined and city fuel economy ratings among all hydrogen fuel cell cars rated by the EPA that year, with a combined city/highway rating of 67 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (MPGe), and 68 MPGe in city driving. In 2019, Katsushi Inoue, the president of Honda Europe, stated, \"Our focus is on hybrid and electric vehicles now. Maybe hydrogen fuel cell cars will come, but that\\'s a technology for the next era.\"By 2017, Daimler phased out its FCEV development, citing declining battery costs and increasing range of EVs, and most of the automobile companies developing hydrogen cars had switched their focus to battery electric vehicles. By 2020, only three car makers were still manufacturing, or had active manufacturing programs for hydrogen cars. ==== Fuel economy ==== The following table compares EPA\\'s fuel economy expressed in miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (MPGe) for the two models of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles rated by the EPA as of September 2021, and available in California. === Fuel cells powered by an ethanol reformer === In June 2016, Nissan announced plans to develop fuel cell vehicles powered by ethanol rather than hydrogen. Nissan claims this technical approach would be cheaper, and that it would be easier to deploy the fueling infrastructure than a hydrogen infrastructure. The vehicle would include a tank holding a blend of water and ethanol, which is fed into an onboard reformer that splits it into hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The hydrogen is then fed into a solid oxide fuel cell. According to Nissan, the liquid fuel could be an ethanol-water blend at a 55:45 ratio. === Buses === As of 2020, 5,648 hydrogen fuel cell buses were in use around the world, with 93.7% of them in China.From the late 1980s, concern regarding diesel emissions from buses led to experimentation with fuel cells to power them. After initial experiments with phosphoric acid fuel cells, hydrogen-powered fuel-cell buses were tested in cities in the late 1990s. In the 2000s, buses entered trial service in cities around the world; the European Union supported the research project Clean Urban Transport for Europe.By the 2010s, commercial introduction of hydrogen fuel cell buses was underway around the world. However, many transit operators were purchasing battery electric buses instead, as these were cheaper to operate and purchase. However, battery electric buses lacked range compared to diesel buses, take time to charge (often overnight, comparied with hydrogen fuel cell buses, which can be refilled quickly) and have reduced energy storage in cold weather. Some companies have proposed using the fuel cell as a range extender, combining it with a larger battery or a supercapacitor.Hydrogen fuel cell buses have historically been significantly more expensive to purchase and operate than diesel, hybrid or electric buses. In recent years, costs have been reduced to levels comparable with diesel buses.A variety of bus manufacturers are currently producing hydrogen fuel cell buses. Bus manufacturers usually work with a provider of hydrogen fuel cells to power the bus, such as Ballard Power Systems or Toyota. === Forklifts === A fuel cell forklift (also called a fuel cell lift truck or a fuel cell forklift) is a fuel cell-powered industrial forklift truck used to lift and transport materials. Most fuel cells used in forklifts are powered by PEM fuel cells.In 2013, there were over 4,000 fuel cell forklifts used in material handling in the US from which only 500 received funding from DOE (2012). Fuel cell fleets are operated by a large number of companies, including Sysco Foods, FedEx Freight, GENCO (at Wegmans, Coca-Cola, Kimberly Clark, and Whole Foods), and H-E-B Grocers. Europe demonstrated 30 fuel cell forklifts with Hylift and extended it with HyLIFT-EUROPE to 200 units, with other projects in France and Austria. Pike Research stated in 2011 that fuel-cell-powered forklifts will be the largest driver of hydrogen fuel demand by 2020.PEM fuel-cell-powered forklifts provide significant benefits over petroleum powered forklifts as they produce no local emissions. Fuel-cell forklifts can work for a full 8-hour shift on a single tank of hydrogen, can be refueled in 3 minutes and have a lifetime of 8–10 years. Fuel cell-powered forklifts are often used in refrigerated warehouses as their performance is not degraded by lower temperatures. In design the FC units are often made as drop-in replacements. === Motorcycles and bicycles === In 2005, the British firm Intelligent Energy produced the first working hydrogen run motorcycle called the ENV (Emission Neutral Vehicle). It holds enough fuel to run for four hours, and to travel 160 km (100 mi) in an urban area, at a top speed of 80 km/h (50 mph). There are other examples of bikes and bicycles with a hydrogen fuel cell engine. The Suzuki Burgman received \"whole vehicle type\" approval in the EU. The PHB was a hydrogen bicycle with an electric motor. It debuted in Shanghai in 2008, but it was discontinued due to lack of hydrogen fuel services. Its predecessor was a hydrogen bicycle called Palcan, based in Vancouver, Canada. === Airplanes === Boeing researchers and industry partners throughout Europe conducted experimental flight tests in February 2008 of a crewed airplane powered only by a fuel cell and lightweight batteries. The Fuel Cell Demonstrator Airplane, as it was called, used a Proton-Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cell/lithium-ion battery hybrid system to power an electric motor, which was coupled to a conventional propeller. In 2003, the world\\'s first propeller driven airplane to be powered entirely by a fuel cell was flown. The fuel cell was a unique FlatStack stack design which allowed the fuel cell to be integrated with the aerodynamic surfaces of the plane.There have been several fuel cell powered unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). A Horizon fuel cell UAV set the record distance flown by a small UAV in 2007. The military is especially interested in this application because of the low noise, low thermal signature and ability to attain high altitude. In 2009, the Naval Research Laboratory\\'s (NRL\\'s) Ion Tiger utilized a hydrogen-powered fuel cell and flew for 23 hours and 17 minutes. Boeing is completing tests on the Phantom Eye, a high-altitude, long endurance (HALE) to be used to conduct research and surveillance flying at 20,000 m (65,000 ft) for up to four days at a time. Fuel cells are also being used to provide auxiliary power for aircraft, replacing fossil fuel generators that were previously used to start the engines and power on board electrical needs. Fuel cells can help airplanes reduce CO2 and other pollutant emissions and noise. === Boats === The world\\'s first Fuel Cell Boat HYDRA used an AFC system with 6.5 kW net output. For each liter of fuel consumed, the average outboard motor produces 140 times less the hydrocarbons produced by the average modern car. Fuel cell engines have higher energy efficiencies than combustion engines, and therefore offer better range and significantly reduced emissions. Amsterdam introduced its first fuel cell powered boat in 2011 that ferries people around the city\\'s canals. === Submarines === The first submersible application of fuel cells is the German Type 212 submarine. Each Type 212 contains nine PEM fuel cells, spread throughout the ship, providing between 30 kW and 50 kW each of electrical power. This allows the Type 212 to remain submerged longer and makes them more difficult to detect. Fuel cell powered submarines are also easier to design, manufacture, and maintain than nuclear-powered submarines. === Trains === In March 2015, China South Rail Corporation (CSR) demonstrated the world\\'s first hydrogen fuel cell-powered tramcar at an assembly facility in Qingdao. 83 miles of tracks for the new vehicle were built in seven Chinese cities. China had plans to spend 200 billion yuan ($32 billion) over the next five years to increase tram tracks to more than 1,200 miles.In 2016, Alstom debuted the Coradia iLint, a regional train powered by hydrogen fuel cells. It was designed to reach 140 kilometres per hour (87 mph) and travel 600–800 kilometres (370–500 mi) on a full tank of hydrogen. The train entered service in Germany in 2018 and is expected to be tested in the Netherlands beginning in 2019.Swiss manufacturer Stadler Rail signed a contract in California to supply a hydrogen fuel cell train in the US, the FLIRT H2 train, in 2024 as part of the Arrow rail project. === Trucks === For transport applications such as long-haul trucks, fuel cells are a potential solution for zero emission transport. A 2022 study in Energies magazine cites relatively fast refueling times compared with electric truck charging times and the current limitations of the energy density of batteries, but they note that \"operating constraints\" include the \"high amount of CO2 emissions [caused by] hydrogen production\", the lack of storage and refueling infrastructure, H2 leakage and safety challenges, efficiency \"losses in compression, storage and dispensing\", .In 2020, Hyundai started to manufacture hydrogen powered 34-ton cargo trucks under the model name XCIENT, making an initial shipment of 10 of the vehicles to Switzerland. They are able to travel 400 kilometres (250 mi) on a full tank and take 8 to 20 minutes to fill up.In 2022, Total Transportation Services (TTSI), Toyota Logistics Services (TLS), UPS, and Southern Counties Express (SCE) are operating a 12-month \"Shore-to-Store (S2S) project\" running hydrogen fuel cell trucks on trips from Los Angeles area ports. The Kenworth T680 hydrogen prototype used in Los Angeles and Long Beach was unveiled in 2018 and has also been tested in the Seattle area. == Hydrogen infrastructure == Eberle and Rittmar von Helmolt stated in 2010 that challenges remain before fuel cell cars can become competitive with other technologies and cite the lack of an extensive hydrogen infrastructure in the U.S.: As of July 2020, there were 43 publicly accessible hydrogen refueling stations in the US, 41 of which were located in California. In 2013, Governor Jerry Brown signed AB 8, a bill to fund $20 million a year for 10 years to build up to 100 stations. In 2014, the California Energy Commission funded $46.6 million to build 28 stations.Japan got its first commercial hydrogen fueling station in 2014. By March 2016, Japan had 80 hydrogen fueling stations, and the Japanese government aims to double this number to 160 by 2020. In May 2017, there were 91 hydrogen fueling stations in Japan. Germany had 18 public hydrogen fueling stations in July 2015. The German government hoped to increase this number to 50 by end of 2016, but only 30 were open in June 2017. == Codes and standards == Under United Nations global technical regulations for wheeled vehicles, specifically regarding hydrogen usage, there are international standards which define aspects of engineering and overall integrity, performance, safety, part lifecycle, and various other categories. One notable area of these regulations is regarding the compressed hydrogen storage systems that typically reach the end of qualified service life at 15 or fewer years in use. == US programs == In 2003, US President George Bush proposed the Hydrogen Fuel Initiative (HFI). The HFI aimed to further develop hydrogen fuel cells and infrastructure technologies to accelerate the commercial introduction of fuel cell vehicles. By 2008, the U.S. had contributed 1 billion dollars to this project. In 2009, Steven Chu, then the US Secretary of Energy, asserted that hydrogen vehicles \"will not be practical over the next 10 to 20 years\". In 2012, however, Chu stated that he saw fuel cell cars as more economically feasible as natural gas prices had fallen and hydrogen reforming technologies had improved. In June 2013, the California Energy Commission granted $18.7M for hydrogen fueling stations. In 2013, Governor Brown signed AB 8, a bill to fund $20 million a year for 10 years for up to 100 stations. In 2013, the US DOE announced up to $4 million planned for \"continued development of advanced hydrogen storage systems\". On May 13, 2013, the Energy Department launched H2USA, which is focused on advancing hydrogen infrastructure in the US. == Cost == By 2010, advancements in fuel cell technology had reduced the size, weight and cost of fuel cell electric vehicles. In 2010, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) estimated that the cost of automobile fuel cells had fallen 80% since 2002 and that such fuel cells could potentially be manufactured for $51/kW, assuming high-volume manufacturing cost savings. Fuel cell electric vehicles have been produced with \"a driving range of more than 250 miles between refueling\". They can be refueled in less than 5 minutes. Deployed fuel cell buses have a 40% higher fuel economy than diesel buses. EERE\\'s Fuel Cell Technologies Program claims that, as of 2011, fuel cells achieved a 42 to 53% fuel cell electric vehicle efficiency at full power, and a durability of over 75,000 miles with less than 10% voltage degradation, double that achieved in 2006. In 2012, Lux Research, Inc. issued a report that concluded that \"Capital cost ... will limit adoption to a mere 5.9 GW\" by 2030, providing \"a nearly insurmountable barrier to adoption, except in niche applications\". Lux\\'s analysis concluded that by 2030, PEM stationary fuel cell applications will reach $1 billion, while the vehicle market, including fuel cell forklifts, will reach a total of $2 billion. == Environmental impact == The environmental impact of fuel cell vehicles depends on the primary energy with which the hydrogen was produced. Fuel cell vehicles are only environmentally benign when the hydrogen was produced with renewable energy. If this is the case fuel cell cars are cleaner and more efficient than fossil fuel cars. However, they are not as efficient as battery electric vehicles which consume much less energy. Usually a fuel cell car consumes 2.4 times more energy than a battery electric car, because electrolysis and storage of hydrogen is much less efficient than using electricity to directly load a battery.As of 2009, motor vehicles used most of the petroleum consumed in the U.S. and produced over 60% of the carbon monoxide emissions and about 20% of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, however production of hydrogen for hydro cracking used in gasoline production chief amongst its industrial uses was responsible for approximately 10% of fleet wide greenhouse gas emissions. In contrast, a vehicle fueled with pure hydrogen emits few pollutants, producing mainly water and heat, although the production of the hydrogen would create pollutants unless the hydrogen used in the fuel cell were produced using only renewable energy.In a 2005 well-to-wheels analysis, the DOE estimated that fuel cell electric vehicles using hydrogen produced from natural gas would result in emissions of approximately 55% of the CO2 per mile of internal combustion engine vehicles and have approximately 25% less emissions than hybrid vehicles. In 2006, Ulf Bossel stated that the large amount of energy required to isolate hydrogen from natural compounds (water, natural gas, biomass), package the light gas by compression or liquefaction, transfer the energy carrier to the user, plus the energy lost when it is converted to useful electricity with fuel cells, leaves around 25% for practical use.\" Richard Gilbert, co-author of Transport Revolutions: Moving People and Freight without Oil (2010), comments similarly, that producing hydrogen gas ends up using some of the energy it creates. Then, energy is taken up by converting the hydrogen back into electricity within fuel cells. \"\\'This means that only a quarter of the initially available energy reaches the electric motor\\' ... Such losses in conversion don\\'t stack up well against, for instance, recharging an electric vehicle (EV) like the Nissan Leaf or Chevy Volt from a wall socket\". A 2010 well-to-wheels analysis of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles report from Argonne National Laboratory states that renewable H2 pathways offer much larger green house gas benefits. This result has recently been confirmed. In 2010, a US DOE well-to-wheels publication assumed that the efficiency of the single step of compressing hydrogen to 6,250 psi (43.1 MPa) at the refueling station is 94%. A 2016 study in the November issue of the journal Energy by scientists at Stanford University and the Technical University of Munich concluded that, even assuming local hydrogen production, \"investing in all-electric battery vehicles is a more economical choice for reducing carbon dioxide emissions, primarily due to their lower cost and significantly higher energy efficiency.\" == Criticism of fuel cell cars == In 2008, professor Jeremy P. Meyers, in the Electrochemical Society journal Interface wrote that fuel cells \"are not as efficient as batteries, due primarily to the inefficiency of the oxygen reduction reaction. ... [T]hey make the most sense for operation disconnected from the grid, or when fuel can be provided continuously. For applications that require frequent and relatively rapid start-ups ... where zero emissions are a requirement, as in enclosed spaces such as warehouses.\" Also in 2008, Wired News reported that \"experts say it will be 40 years or more before hydrogen has any meaningful impact on gasoline consumption or global warming, and we can\\'t afford to wait that long. In the meantime, fuel cells are diverting resources from more immediate solutions.\" In 2008, Robert Zubrin, the author of Energy Victory, said: \"Hydrogen is \\'just about the worst possible vehicle fuel\\'\". If hydrogen could be produced using renewable energy, \"it would surely be easier simply to use this energy to charge the batteries of all-electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles.\" The Los Angeles Times wrote in 2009, \"Any way you look at it, hydrogen is a lousy way to move cars.\" The Washington Post asked in November 2009, \"[W]hy would you want to store energy in the form of hydrogen and then use that hydrogen to produce electricity for a motor, when electrical energy is already waiting to be sucked out of sockets all over America and stored in auto batteries...?\"The Motley Fool stated in 2013 that \"there are still cost-prohibitive obstacles [for hydrogen cars] relating to transportation, storage, and, most importantly, production.\" Volkswagen\\'s Rudolf Krebs said in 2013 that \"no matter how excellent you make the cars themselves, the laws of physics hinder their overall efficiency. The most efficient way to convert energy to mobility is electricity.\" He elaborated: \"Hydrogen mobility only makes sense if you use green energy\", but ... you need to convert it first into hydrogen \"with low efficiencies\" where \"you lose about 40 percent of the initial energy\". You then must compress the hydrogen and store it under high pressure in tanks, which uses more energy. \"And then you have to convert the hydrogen back to electricity in a fuel cell with another efficiency loss\". Krebs continued: \"in the end, from your original 100 percent of electric energy, you end up with 30 to 40 percent.\"In 2014, electric automotive and energy futurist Julian Cox wrote that producing hydrogen from methane \"is significantly more carbon intensive per unit of energy than coal. Mistaking fossil hydrogen from the hydraulic fracturing of shales for an environmentally sustainable energy pathway threatens to encourage energy policies that will dilute and potentially derail global efforts to head-off climate change due to the risk of diverting investment and focus from vehicle technologies that are economically compatible with renewable energy.\" In 2014, former Dept. of Energy official Joseph Romm concluded that renewable energy cannot economically be used to make hydrogen for an FCV fleet \"either now or in the future.\" GreenTech Media\\'s analyst reached similar conclusions in 2014. In 2015, Clean Technica listed some of the disadvantages of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.A 2017 analysis published in Green Car Reports found that the best hydrogen fuel cell vehicles consume \"more than three times more electricity per mile than an electric vehicle ... generate more greenhouse-gas emissions than other powertrain technologies ... [and have] very high fuel costs. ... Considering all the obstacles and requirements for new infrastructure (estimated to cost as much as $400 billion), fuel-cell vehicles seem likely to be a niche technology at best, with little impact on U.S. oil consumption. In 2017, Michael Barnard, writing in Forbes, listed the continuing disadvantages of hydrogen fuel cell cars and concluded that \"by about 2008, it was very clear that hydrogen was and would be inferior to battery technology as a storage of energy for vehicles. [B]y 2025 the last hold outs should likely be retiring their fuel cell dreams.” A 2019 video by Real Engineering noted that using hydrogen as a fuel for cars does not help to reduce carbon emissions from transportation. The 95% of hydrogen still produced from fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide, and producing hydrogen from water is an energy-consuming process. Storing hydrogen requires more energy either to cool it down to the liquid state or to put it into tanks under high pressure, and delivering the hydrogen to fueling stations requires more energy and may release more carbon. The hydrogen needed to move a FCV a kilometer costs approximately eight times as much as the electricity needed to move a BEV the same distance. Also in 2019, Katsushi Inoue, the president of Honda Europe, stated, \"Our focus is on hybrid and electric vehicles now. Maybe hydrogen fuel cell cars will come, but that\\'s a technology for the next era.\"Assessments since 2020 have concluded that hydrogen vehicles are still only 38% efficient, while battery EVs from 80% to 95% efficient. A 2021 assessment by CleanTechnica concluded that while hydrogen cars are far less efficient than electric cars, the vast majority of hydrogen being produced is polluting grey hydrogen, and delivering hydrogen would require building a vast and expensive new infrastructure, the remaining two \"advantages of fuel cell vehicles – longer range and fast fueling times – are rapidly being eroded by improving battery and charging technology.\" A 2022 study in Nature Electronics agreed. == Innovation == Fuel cell patent fillings in the area of hydrogen fuel cells increased in the 1960s, partly due to NASAs space program; another increase in the 80s was driven by research for automobiles. This was followed by a surge in filings from 2000 to 2005 by inventors in Japan, US and South Korea. Since then, China has dominated patent fillings in the field, with a smaller number in Japan, Germany, South Korea and the US. Between 2016 and 2020, annual filings, particularly for transportation applications, increased by a further 23%.Almost 80% of the patents in the area of fuel cells for transportation were filed by car companies. Academia is collaborating actively with the industry. Although filings related to road vehicles such as cars and trucks dominate, inventions in other areas like shipping, aviation, rail and other special vehicles is increasing. Airbus, a major aircraft manufacturer, has increased its patenting activity in the area since 2019. The number of fuel cell patents for shipping applications is comparable in size to the one for aviation and similarly slow in growth.A World Intellectual Property Organization report argues that because heavy-duty vehicles, such as construction vehicles, forklifts, and airport tugs require a higher payload, the high energy density of hydrogen can make fuel cells a more advantageous solution than battery applications. == See also == Hydrogen vehicle Glossary of fuel cell terms Proton-exchange membrane fuel cell Reformed methanol fuel cell Fuel cell auxiliary power unit Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Energy Association Water-fuelled car == Notes == == External links == Heetebrij, Jan. \"A vision on a sustainable electric society supported by Electric Vehicles\", Olino Renewable Energy, June 5, 2009 Ulrich Hottelet: State funding for hybrid dreams, The Asia Pacific Times, October 2009 Fuel cell market size per Prescient & Strategic Market Research 2021',\n",

              " 'Birley Old Hall is a small English country house situated in the Birley Edge area of the City of Sheffield, England. The hall stands in an exposed situation at almost 200 metres above sea level on Edge Lane, some six km NW of the city centre and has been designated a Grade II listed building by English Heritage as has the Falconry which stands in the garden. == History == The hall was constructed in two phases, the easterly facing wing was constructed in the Late Middle Ages when it was known as “Byrlay Edge”, it was built with an oak cruck frame with an exterior of squared stone. Part of the cruck frame can be seen on the Edge Lane side of the original wing. In 1705 J. Carr added a new and more impressive south facing wing at right angles to the original. The 1705 extension has been described as having “restrained elegance” and included the construction of a gazebo in the garden, called the Falconry. The hall underwent some alterations and additions during the late 18th and mid 19th centuries, including a two-storey addition to the original wing. The hall was used briefly as a Youth Hostel in the 1940s and was purchased by Sheffield City Council after World War II. In 1959 the council leased the building to the steel manufacturers Daniel Doncaster and Sons as offices and the hall was extensively restored. The hall and Birley Edge lost much of its rural isolation in the 1960s when the Fox Hill council housing estate was constructed on land to the immediate south. The hall returned to use as a private dwelling in the early 1980s and once more was totally restored during its conversion back to residential use. The interior of the house has features such as large fireplaces dating from the 1600s, along with exposed original stone work in one of the lounges and larger bedrooms. == Architecture == The hall is constructed from locally quarried squared stone and is L shaped, the 1705 building has a coped date stone above the main door with the inscriptionS “JC 1705” and “DD 1959”. The roofs are gabled and hipped. The building has a mixture of mullioned, sash and casement windows. == References ==',\n",

              " 'In feudal Japan, individual military and citizens groups were primarily responsible for self-defense until the unification of Japan by Tokugawa Ieyasu in 1603. During the Edo period (1603–1868), the Tokugawa shogunate formed a centralized feudal government. Samurai warriors who once protected Japan from foreign enemies and fought each other for supremacy became the new police and internal security force. Their new job would be to ensure civil peace, which they accomplished for over 250 years. == History == During the Edo period the authoritarian Tokugawa shogunate instituted an elaborate police/security state, an administrative hierarchy was developed, and rules and regulations controlling many aspects of life in Japan went into effect. This new system of government has been called a police state, possibly the world\\'s first.In 1868 the samurai era ended with the overthrow of the Tokugawa shogunate and a new government came into power (Meiji government) and the samurai class was eventually abolished. In 1872, a former samurai, Kawaji Toshiyoshi, was sent to Europe to study systems of policing and he recommended a restructuring based partially on French and Prussian systems. In 1874, a nationalized police force was created using European police systems as a model. This new police force was the start of the modern police system in Japan, though it was initially dominated by former samurai from Satsuma who were part of the driving force behind the removal of the Tokugawa shogunate. The new Meiji period police continued the Edo period method of Japanese police controlling societal behavior and internal security as well as preventing and solving crimes. == Organization == The Edo period police apparatus utilized a multi-layered bureaucracy which employed the services of a wide variety of Japanese citizens. High and low ranking samurai, former criminals, private citizens and even citizen groups (Gonin Gumi) participated in keeping the peace and enforcing the laws and regulations of the Tokugawa shogunate. === Samurai police === Machi-bugyōDuring the Edo period, high ranking samurai with an allegiance to the Tokugawa shogunate (hatamoto) were appointed machi-bugyō (city administrators or commissioners). The machi-bugyō performed the roles of chief of police, prosecutor, judge and other judicial related business both criminal and civil in Edo and other major towns. YorikiWorking under the machi-bugyō was the yoriki. Yoriki were samurai—they managed patrols and guard units composed of lower ranking police officials. Yoriki, being of a higher class, were able to ride a horse while performing their duties and were trusted to carry out assignments of high importance. DōshinWorking under the yoriki was the dōshin. Dōshin were samurai but of a lower class than yoriki—they performed the duties of prison guard and patrol officer which required close contact with commoners (chonin). They investigated crimes such as murder and helped with executions. === Non-samurai police assistants === Edo period police relied heavily on commoners for assistance, from average village dwellers to the outcast hinin and eda castes. Members of the Japanese outcast were particularly helpful with guarding and executing prisoners, and disposing the bodies, something that samurai found to be repugnant (distasteful). KomonoKomono were non-samurai chōnin who went with the dōshin on patrols and provided assistance. OkappikiOkappiki were non-samurai from the lowest outcast class, often former criminals who worked for the dōshin as informers and spies. Gōyokiki/meakashiGōyokiki or meakashi were a non-samurai chōnin or outcast class who were hired by local residents and merchants to work as police assistants in a particular neighborhood—they were often former criminals. The term \"tesaki\" was used to describe gōyokiki or meakashi later in the Edo period. == Duties == Investigating crimes, arresting and interrogating arrested suspects, torturing criminal suspects in order to obtain a confession, punishing convicted criminals including executions. == Equipment == Edo period police used a variety of armor and carried lethal and non-lethal weapons to capture criminal suspects. If possible, suspected criminals were taken alive. This meant that special weapons and tactics had to be created in order to accomplish this task. === Weapons === Bansho rokugin or keigo roku-go: Edo period police stations were required to keep six kinds of weapons (bansho rokugin or keigo roku-go) available for use in case of disturbances. these were the kanamuchi, the kiriko no bo, the tetto, the sodegarami, the tsukubo, and the sasumata. Three of these tools were called torimono sandōgu (\"three tools of arresting\"), which consisted of the sodegarami, sasumata, and tsukubō. They were symbols of office and were often displayed in front of police checkpoints or used in processions, especially while convicted prisoners were being led to their execution. Sodegarami Sasumata Tsukubo Kanamuchi Kiriko no bo Tetto Metsubushi Jitte: an iron or wooden club or truncheon, the jitte was a non-lethal weapon and an official symbol of office. Te yari (hand spear): a small version of the yari suitable for use in confined spaces. Kusari fundo/manriki == Weapons == == Armour == Edo period police and assistants wore chain armour clothing, armour for the hands, and armour for the head. == See also == Criminal punishment in Edo-period Japan Jitte Law enforcement in Japan Shinsengumi Torimono sandōgu == Citations == == General references == Ames, Walter L.

              " 'Fulke Greville, 1st Baron Brooke, de jure 13th Baron Latimer and 5th Baron Willoughby de Broke KB PC (; 3 October 1554 – 30 September 1628), known before 1621 as Sir Fulke Greville, was an Elizabethan poet, dramatist, and statesman who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1581 and 1621, when he was raised to the peerage. Greville was a capable administrator who served the English Crown under Elizabeth I and James I as, successively, treasurer of the navy, chancellor of the exchequer, and commissioner of the Treasury, and who for his services was in 1621 made Baron Brooke, peer of the realm. Greville was granted Warwick Castle in 1604, making numerous improvements. Greville is best known today as the biographer of Sir Philip Sidney, and for his sober poetry, which presents dark, thoughtful and distinctly Calvinist views on art, literature, beauty and other philosophical matters. == Life == Fulke Greville, born 3 October 1554, at Beauchamp Court, near Alcester, Warwickshire, was the only son of Sir Fulke Greville (1536–1606) and Anne Neville (d. 1583), the daughter of Ralph Neville, 4th Earl of Westmorland. He was the grandson of Sir Fulke Greville (d. 10 November 1559) and Elizabeth Willoughby (buried 15 November 1562), eldest daughter of Robert Willoughby, 2nd Baron Willoughby de Broke, the only other child of the marriage was a daughter, Margaret Greville (1561–1631/2), who married Sir Richard Verney.He was sent in 1564, on the same day as his lifelong friend, Philip Sidney, to Shrewsbury School. He then went up to Jesus College, Cambridge in 1568.Sir Henry Sidney, Philip\\'s father, and president of the Council of Wales and the Marches, gave Greville in 1576 a post connected with the court of the Welsh Marches, but Greville resigned it in 1577 to go to attend the court of Queen Elizabeth I along with Philip Sidney. There, Greville became a great favourite with the Queen, who valued his sober character and administrative skills. In 1581, he was elected in a by-election as Member of Parliament for Southampton. Queen Elizabeth made him secretary to the principality of Wales in 1583. However, he was put out of favour more than once for leaving the country against her wishes. In 1581 at a Whitehall tournament in honour of French ambassadors Greville, Philip Sidney, Philip Howard Earl of Arundel and Frederick Lord Windsor staged an entertainment as the \"Four Foster Children of Desire\". The ambassadors were working on plans for Elizabeth\\'s marriage to Francis, Duke of Anjou. The \"Foster Children\" laid siege to the \"Fortress of Perfect Beautie\". After two days of challenges the Children admitted defeat. The entertainment was understood to convey the idea that Elizabeth was unattainable, devised by the opposition to the French marriage.Greville, Philip Sidney and Sir Edward Dyer were members of the \"Areopagus\", the literary clique which, under the leadership of Gabriel Harvey, supported the introduction of classical metres into English verse. Sidney and Greville arranged to sail with Sir Francis Drake in 1585 in his expedition against the Spanish West Indies, but Elizabeth forbade Drake to take them with him, and also refused Greville\\'s request to be allowed to join Robert Dudley\\'s army in the Netherlands. Philip Sidney, who took part in the campaign, was killed on 17 October 1586. Greville memorialized his beloved friend in A Dedication to Sir Philip Sidney. Greville participated in the Battle of Coutras in 1587. About 1591 Greville served further for a short time in Normandy under King Henry III of Navarre in the French Wars of Religion. This was his last experience of war. Greville represented Warwickshire in parliament in 1592–1593, 1597, 1601 and 1621. In 1598 he was made Treasurer of the Navy, and he retained the office through the early years of the reign of James I. Greville was granted Warwick Castle—situated on a bend of the River Avon in Warwickshire—by King James I in 1604. The castle was in a dilapidated condition when he took possession of it, and he spent £20,000 to restore it.In 1614 he became chancellor and under-treasurer of the exchequer, and throughout the reign, he was a valued supporter of James I, although in 1615 he advocated the summoning of Parliament. In 1618 he became commissioner of the treasury, and in 1621 he was raised to the peerage with the title of Baron Brooke, a title which had belonged to the family of his paternal grandmother. == Death and legacy == In 1628 Greville was stabbed at his house in Holborn, London by Ralph Haywood, a servant who believed that he had been cheated by being left out of his master\\'s will. Haywood then turned the knife on himself. Greville\\'s physicians treated his wounds by filling them with pig fat. Rather than disinfecting them, the pig fat turned rancid and infected the wounds, and he died in agony four weeks after the attack. His body was brought back to Warwick, and he was buried in the Collegiate Church of St Mary, Warwick, and on his tomb was inscribed the epitaph he had composed: Greville has numerous streets named after him in the Hatton Garden area of Holborn, London (see Hatton Garden#Street names etymologies). A line from Chorus Sacerdotum from Mustapha is quoted by Christopher Hitchens in his book Letters to a Young Contrarian.In 2018 the first-ever festival dedicated to Greville was launched in his home town, Alcester, Warwickshire. == Works == Greville is best known for his biography of Sidney (composed c. 1610–12), which circulated in manuscript with the title A Dedication to Sir Philip Sidney. It was published in 1652 as The Life of the Renowned Sir Philip Sidney. He includes some autobiographical matter in what amounts to a treatise on government. Greville\\'s poetry consists of closet tragedies, sonnets, and poems on political and moral subjects. His style is grave and sententious. Greville\\'s works include: BiographyA Dedication to Sir Philip SidneyCloset dramaAlaham MustaphaVerse poemsCaelica in CX Sonnets Of Monarchy A Treatise of Religion A Treatie of Humane Learning An Inquisition upon Fame and Honour A Treatie of WarresMiscellaneous prosea letter to an \"Honourable Lady\", a letter to Grevill Varney in France, a short speech delivered on behalf of Francis Bacon === Editions === Greville\\'s works were collected and reprinted by Alexander Balloch Grosart, in 1870, in four volumes. Poetry and Drama of Fulke Greville, edited by Geoffrey Bullough, was published in 1938. The Prose Works of Fulke Greville, edited by John Gouws, were published in 1986. The Selected Poems of Fulke Greville edited by Thom Gunn, with an afterword by Bradin Cormack, was published in 2009 (University of Chicago Press, ISBN 978-0-226-30846-3.) The Tragedy of Mustapha (London: Printed by J. Windet for N. Butter, 1609). Certaine Learned and Elegant Workes (London: Printed by E. Purslowe for H. Seyle, 1633) comprises A Treatise of Humane Learning, An Inquisition upon Fame and Honour, A Treatise of Wars, Alaham, Mustapha, Caelica, A Letter to an Honorable Lady, and A Letter of Travel. The Remains of Sir Fvlk Grevill Lord Brooke: Being Poems of Monarchy and Religion: Never Before Printed (London: Printed by T. N. for H.

Poems and Dramas of Fulke Greville, First Lord Brooke, 2 volumes, edited by Geoffrey Bullough (Edinburgh: Oliver & Boyd, 1939; New York: Oxford University Press, 1945) comprises Caelica, A Treatise of Humane Learning, An Inquisition upon Fame and Honor, A Treatise of Wars, Mustapha, and Alaham. The Remains: Being Poems of Monarchy and Religion, edited by G. A. Wilkes (London: Oxford University Press, 1965) comprises A Treatise of Monarchy and A Treatise of Religion. The Prose Works Fulke Greville, Lord Brooke, edited by John Guows (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997), published as part of the Oxford English Texts series. A scholarly edition of his prose works, with an authoritative text, together with an introduction, commentary notes, and scholarly apparatus.The principal repository for Fulke Greville\\'s papers is the British Library (Add MSS 54566-54571, the Warwick Manuscripts; letters in the as-yet uncatalogued Earl Cowper mss.). Individual manuscripts of the Dedication to Sir Philip Sidney are to be found at the Bodleian Library, Oxford (a manuscript formerly owned by Dr. B. E. Juel-Jensen); Trinity College, Cambridge (MSS R.7.32 and 33); and the Shrewsbury Library (MS 295). == Critical reception == Charles Lamb commented on Greville: \"He is nine parts Machiavel and Tacitus, for one of Sophocles and Seneca... Whether we look into his plays or his most passionate love-poems, we shall find all frozen and made rigid with intellect.\" He goes on to speak of the obscurity of expression that runs through all of Greville\\'s poetry. Andrea McCrea sees the influence of Justus Lipsius in the Letter to an Honourable Lady, but elsewhere detects a scepticism more akin to Michel de Montaigne.A rhyming elegy on Greville, published in Henry Huth\\'s Inedited Poetical Miscellanies, brings charges of miserliness against him. Robert Pinsky has asserted that this work is comparable in force of imagination to John Donne. == Family == Lord Brooke, who never married, left no natural heirs, and his senior (Brooke) barony passed to his cousin and adopted son, Robert Greville (1608–1643), who took the side of Parliament in the English Civil War, and defeated the Royalists in a skirmish at Kineton in August 1642. Robert was killed during the siege of Lichfield on 2 March 1643, having survived the elder Greville by only fifteen years. His other barony (Willoughby de Broke) was inherited by his sister Margaret who married Sir Richard Verney. == See also == Canons of Elizabethan poetry List of owners of Warwick Castle == Notes == == References == == Sources == == Further reading == The Prose Works of Fulke Greville, Lord Brooke, edited by John Gouws (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1986) Paula Bennet, \"Recent Studies in Greville,\" English Literary Renaissance, 2 (Winter 1972): 376–382.

              " 'Taxiing (rarely spelled taxying) is the movement of an aircraft on the ground, under its own power, in contrast to towing or pushback where the aircraft is moved by a tug. The aircraft usually moves on wheels, but the term also includes aircraft with skis or floats (for water-based travel). An airplane uses taxiways to taxi from one place on an airport to another; for example, when moving from a hangar to the runway. The term \"taxiing\" is not used for the accelerating run along a runway prior to takeoff, or the decelerating run immediately after landing, which are called the takeoff roll and landing rollout, respectively. == Etymology == As early as 1909 aviation journalists envisioned aeroplanes to replace the taxicab in traffic-congested cities.Some aviators and some linguists report that around the year 1911 the slang word \"taxi\" was in use for an \"airplane\". They suggest that the way aircraft move under power before they take off or after they land reminded someone of the way taxicabs slowly drove around the block when looking for passengers.Also by 1909, French aviation pioneers like Blériot, Farman and Voisin used the term \"taxi\" for a trainer aircraft, that was so constructed that a pupil would not accidentally get airborne.Usage of the word for an airplane quickly disappeared again, but the verb \"to taxi\" stuck, and words like the \"taxiway\" were derived from it. == Propulsion == The thrust to propel the aircraft forward comes from its propellers or jet engines. Reverse thrust for backing up can be generated by thrust reversers such as on the Boeing C-17 Globemaster III, or reversible pitch propellers such as on the Lockheed C-130 Hercules, a procedure known as powerback. Most aircraft, however, are not designed to back up on their own and must be pushed back either by hand or by using an aircraft tug. At low power settings, combustion aircraft engines operate at lower efficiency than at cruise power settings. A typical A320 spends an average of 3.5 hours a day taxiing, using 600 liters (160 U.S. gal) of fuel. Hybrid electrically driven nose gear are under development to allow high use aircraft to shut down the engines during taxi operations. == Control == Steering is achieved by turning a nose wheel or tail wheel/rudder; the pilot controls the direction travelled with their feet. Larger jet aircraft have a tiller wheel on the left side of the cockpit that acts as a steering wheel allowing the nosewheel to be turned hydraulically. Braking is controlled by differential toe or heel brakes. Not all aircraft have steerable wheels, and in some cases steering is solely by means of differential braking (all Van\\'s aircraft for instance) or solely by means of the rudder (including all floatplanes). == Hover taxi == Skid-equipped helicopters and other VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) aircraft conduct hover taxiing to move in ground effect in the same manner that wheel-equipped aircraft ground taxi. In general hover taxis are conducted at speeds up to 20 kn (37 km/h; 23 mph), or below translational lift.The Bell CH-135 Twin Huey is hover taxied in a manner typical for skid-equipped aircraft of that size: This sequence is initiated from a stabilized 5 ft hover. Move the aircraft forward over the ground at a brisk walking pace. Maintain a constant height above ground, constant forward speed and ensure that the skids remain parallel to the direction of movement. Anticipate stopping so that large rearward cyclic applications are not required as this may result in the tail skids striking the ground. You are often required to taxi out of wind; be aware that when taxiing downwind in strong wind conditions there may be insufficient rearward cyclic to ensure adequate control and that the tail will be nearer the ground. Taxiing downwind is limited to 30 kts. == Safety == When taxiing, aircraft travel slowly. This ensures that they can be stopped quickly and do not risk wheel damage on larger aircraft if they accidentally turn off the paved surface. Taxi speeds are typically 16 to 19 kn (30 to 35 km/h; 18 to 22 mph).Rotor downwash limits helicopter hover-taxiing near parked light aircraft. The use of engine thrust near terminals is restricted due to the possibility of structural damage or injury to personnel caused by jet blast. == References == == External links == Media related to Taxiways at Wikimedia Commonsaircraft Media related to Taxiing in aviation at Wikimedia Commons',\n",

              " 'Katharine \"Kay\" Brown Barrett (December 7, 1902 – January 18, 1995) was a Hollywood talent scout and agent beginning in the 1930s. She is most famous for bringing Margaret Mitchell\\'s novel Gone with the Wind to the attention of David O. Selznick, for whom she worked, in 1936. She had a long career as representative, talent scout and agent with Leland Hayward, MCA and International Creative Management (\"ICM\"). == Career == Brown was born into New York high society as the daughter of Kate Ross and Henry Collins Brown, a founder of the Museum of the City of New York. In later years, her Hollywood friends were amused by the fact that she was listed in the New York Social Register.In 1924, she graduated from Wellesley College with a B.A. in English and an interest in drama. After graduation, she went to work for the Mary Arden Theater School in Peterborough, New Hampshire, which was owned by Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. and Boston lawyer Guy Currier. In 1926, Kennedy and Currier acquired the movie studio Film Booking Offices of America and offered Brown a job in New York reading and acquiring literary properties for the company, with the title \"Eastern Story Editor\". She stayed with the company, renamed RKO in 1928 after its acquisition by Radio Corporation of America, and achieved her first major success by acquiring Edna Ferber\\'s novel Cimarron. which was being sought by many movie companies, for a then-record $125,000. The movie of the book won the 1931 Academy Award for Best Picture.Later in 1931, David O. Selznick took over RKO. Selznick left RKO in 1933 to return to MGM, but in 1935 he found a financial backer, John Hay Whitney, who allowed him to set up his own studio, Selznick International Pictures. One of his first hires was Brown, still in the role of Eastern Story Editor, but later as \"Eastern Representative\" as Selznick expanded her role at the studio to that of his primary assistant. In addition to Gone with the Wind, she brought Daphne du Maurier\\'s Rebecca to the attention of Selznick. She also persuaded Ingrid Bergman to leave Stockholm for Hollywood for the Selznick production Intermezzo: A Love Story; signed Laurence Olivier to his first American contract for Rebecca, and convinced Alfred Hitchcock to sign a seven-year contract with Selznick International so that he could direct Rebecca. She also acquired the rights to Rose Franken\\'s Claudia: The Story of a Marriage in 1939 and was involved in the screen tests for that story that led to Phylis Walker (later renamed Jennifer Jones by Brown and Selznick) being signed by the studio.For tax reasons, Selznick International Pictures was liquidated in 1942, and the \"tall, elegant and formidable\" Brown, following the example of Selznick\\'s brother Myron, became a talent agent, joining MCA at first and picking up many new clients after MCA acquired Leland Hayward\\'s talent agency. She eventually moved to International Famous Agency, which later became ICM, where she worked for the rest of her career. Among others, she represented actors Alec Guinness, John Gielgud, Ralph Richardson, Rex Harrison, Fredric March, Patricia Neal and Montgomery Clift. Her background acquiring literary properties also led her to represent writers such as Lillian Hellman, Isak Dinesen and, for 40 years, Arthur Miller. Brown Barrett finally retired when she was 80. == Personal life == Kay Brown married James Barrett (died 1967) and had two daughters, Laurinda and Kate.

              " 'The Beltrán Leyva Organization (BLO), also known as the Beltrán Leyva Cartel; Spanish: Cártel de los Beltrán Leyva (CBL), was a Mexican drug cartel and organized crime syndicate, formerly headed by the five Beltrán Leyva brothers: Marcos Arturo, Carlos, Alfredo, Mario Alberto, and Héctor. Founded as a Sinaloa Cartel, the Beltrán Leyva cartel was responsible for transportation and wholesaling of cocaine, heroin and marijuana (and the production of the last two). It controlled numerous drug trafficking corridors, and engaged in human smuggling, money laundering, extortion, kidnapping, murder and gun-running.The BLO was one of Mexico\\'s most powerful drug cartels, which had effectively infiltrated the ranks of various Mexican government agencies and Mexico\\'s Interpol. Its last known leader, Héctor Beltrán Leyva, was arrested in October 2014, having had a multimillion-dollar bounty placed on him by the governments of both the United States and Mexico. On August 11, 2011 the capture of one of the cartel\\'s former top lieutenants, called \"the last Beltran-Leyva link of any importance\", prompted Mexican authorities to declare the cartel disbanded and extinct. == History == Born in the Sinaloan countryside in the 1960s, the Beltrán Leyva brothers—Arturo, Carlos, Alfredo, Mario Alberto and Héctor—worked closely with their cousin, Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán, the leader of the Cartel, during decades of smuggling. Sensing a void in the rival Gulf Cartel after Osiel Cárdenas\\' arrest on March 14, 2003, the organization began to move into Gulf Cartel territory. The gangs fought each other in northern Mexican cities, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of people, including some civilians, police and journalists.In 2004 and 2005, Arturo Beltrán Leyva led powerful groups of assassins to fight for trade routes in northeastern Mexico for the Cartel. Through the use of corruption or intimidation, the Beltrán Leyva Cartel was able to infiltrate Mexico\\'s political, judicial and police institutions to feed classified information about anti-drug operations, and even infiltrated the Interpol office in Mexico.During 2010, former Beltran Leyva cartel lieutenant Óscar Osvaldo García Montoya (a.k.a. El Compayito) attempted to regroup some cartel remnants under a gang he called La Mano Con Ojos. García Montoya was arrested on August 11, 2011; the Attorney General of Mexico had placed a 5 million pesos (US$400,000) bounty for his capture. Mexican authorities stated that García Montoya was \"the last Beltrán-Leyva link of any importance\", and that the cartel has been disbanded.Allied forces of Los Zetas and Beltrán-Leyva remnants clashed on April 28, 2012 with gunmen of the organization in the Choix mountains. At least 32 armed men were confirmed dead. The renewed fighting in Sinaloa state between the BLO and the Cartel is supposedly sparked by the incursion of the Cartel and its allies in Nuevo Laredo, traditionally the biggest Zeta stronghold.The last cartel leader, Héctor Beltrán Leyva, was captured on October 1, 2014 while eating at a popular restaurant in San Miguel de Allende, Guanajuato. The U.S. was offering a reward of US$5 million for information leading to his arrest. while the Mexican government was offering a US$2.1 million reward. === Switch of alliances === The arrest of Beltrán Leyva Organization leader Alfredo Beltrán Leyva (a.k.a. El Mochomo) (\"The Desert Ant\") on January 20, 2008, was a huge blow to the organization, as he allegedly oversaw large-scale drug-smuggling operations and was a key money launderer for the cartel. In apparent revenge for the arrest of his brother Alfredo, Arturo ordered the assassination of the commissioner of the Federal Police, Édgar Eusebio Millán Gómez, and other top federal officials in the Mexican capital. One group of these hit men was captured in a Mexico City house with dozens of assault rifles, pistols, grenade launchers, 30 hand grenades, and bullet-proof jackets bearing the legend FEDA—the Spanish acronym for \\'Special Forces of Arturo\\'. Apparently, the Beltrán Leyva brothers blamed their partner Joaquin \"Chapo\" Guzmán for their brother\\'s arrest, and in retaliation ordered the assassination of Guzmán\\'s son, 22-year-old Édgar Guzmán López, which was carried out in a shopping center parking lot by at least 15 gunmen using assault rifles and grenade launchers.The residual impact of Alfredo\\'s arrest not only undermined long-term alliances, but resurrected animosities between rival cartel leaders Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzmán and Arturo\\'s new allies, the Juárez Cartel, and provided the catalyst behind the bloodshed in Mexico\\'s most-violent city: Ciudad Juárez. The Beltrán Leyva brothers, and those loyalists who departed the Cartel with them, allied with Los Zetas, causing an escalation of conflict in strongholds shared uneasily by \"old\" leaders. In February 2010, the Beltrán Leyva Cartel and Los Zetas engaged in a violent turf war against the new alliance integrated by the Gulf Cartel, Sinaloa Cartel and La Familia Cartel in the border city of Reynosa, Tamaulipas, rendering some border towns \"ghost towns\".Official reports from early 2010 revealed infighting for control of the cartel and its territory. One faction was led by lieutenants Édgar Valdez Villarreal and Gerardo Alvarez-Vazquez, while the other was led by Héctor Beltrán Leyva and his lieutenant Sergio Villarreal Barragán. In April 2010, Héctor Beltrán Leyva created a short-lived cell or branch in Morelos state called South Pacific Cartel (Cártel del Pacífico Sur) best known for having employed a 12-year-old gunman and executioner. == Assets == The cartel\\'s assets included: Dominance over drug and other illegal activities at airports in Mexico, Monterrey, Toluca, Cancún, and Acapulco; Hotels and restaurants constructed to launder money in Cancún, Acapulco, Cozumel, and other resorts; A working agreement with Los Zetas. Supply corridors for moving marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamine from the Andes to the Arctic; Capability to extort, launder money, run guns, smuggle humans, promote prostitution and carry out kidnappings; Operations in Mexico City, Chiapas, Guerrero, Guanajuato, Mexico State, Morelos, Nuevo León, Querétaro, Quintana Roo, Sinaloa, Sonora, and Tamaulipas, as well as in the United States and Canada; Access to some high-ranking public figures and Army personnel whom they bribed or intimidated.Former suppliersThe Beltrán Leyva brothers\\' Colombian cocaine supplier, Ever Villafane Martínez, was arrested in Morelos in August 2008. After that, the organization pursued a relationship with Víctor and Darío Espinoza Valencia of Colombia\\'s Norte del Valle cartel. == Bounty == The United States offered a US$5 million reward for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of Héctor Beltrán Leyva. == Captures == Alfredo Beltrán Leyva was captured on January 20, 2008, and Arturo was killed by Mexican Marines in a shootout on December 16, 2009. Two weeks following Arturo\\'s death, on December 30, 2009, Carlos Beltrán Leyva was captured by the Mexican Federal Police in Culiacán, Sinaloa after showing authorities a fake driver\\'s license of an alias he was living under. Carlos was arrested on charges outstanding since 2008, including drug trafficking, criminal conspiracy, money laundering and illegal firearms.At the same time as federal police arrested Carlos, Beltrán Leyva associates who allegedly murdered four relatives—a mother, siblings and an aunt—of one of the marines involved in the shootout that killed Arturo, were also arrested by Mexican authorities, with a hitman allegedly confessing to the crimes. The killings, allegedly in retaliation for Arturo\\'s death, happened hours after the marine\\'s funeral. On April 22, 2010, cartel lieutenant Gerardo Alvarez-Vazquez was captured on the outskirts of Mexico City; the U.S. had been offering a $2 million U.S. bounty for his arrest. Edgar Valdez Villarreal, the leader of Los Negros cartel enforcement, was arrested on August 30, 2010 outside Mexico City. On January 18, 2011, José Jorge Balderas Garza, known as \"JJ\", the lieutenant and financial operator of the Valdez Villarreal faction, was captured. On September 12, 2010, Sergio Villarreal Barragán was arrested in the city of Puebla, east of Mexico City. Héctor Beltrán Leyva was captured by the Mexican Armed Forces on October 1, 2014.The August 11, 2011 arrest of Óscar Osvaldo García Montoya (a.k.a. El Compayito), a cartel lieutenant, was called \"the last Beltran-Leyva link of any importance\".On April 16, 2014, the second-in-command, Arnoldo Villa Sánchez, was captured by Mexican authorities in the Condesa district in Mexico City.On October 1, 2014, Hector Beltran Leyva and business associate German Goyenechea, who had become the cartel\\'s chief financier, were both captured while eating at a popular restaurant in San Miguel de Allende.On October 11, 2017, the U.S. Justice Department arrested Sajid Emilio Quintero Navidad, 36, at the San Ysidro Port of Entry. He was charged with money-laundering and drug-trafficking. Navidad, who also goes by the name El Cadete is the cousin of fugitive drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero, who is allegedly responsible for the killing of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration Agent Enrique \"Kiki\" Camarena.On July 4, 2019, Héctor Huerta Ríos, the leader of the Beltran-Leyva Cartel in Nuevo Leon who was previously arrested in 2009, was killed by a rival cartel after being shot while driving in Jalisco. His wife, who was in the car with her husband and their two daughters, identified his body to police the next day. == Split == Following the death of Arturo Beltran Leyva on December 16, 2009, and the arrest of Edgar Valdez Villarreal on August 30, 2010, the Beltran Leyva brothers lost much of their influence. The cartel then divided into separate independent groups: Los Mazatlecos in Sinaloa and Nayarit, an armed loyalist wing of the Beltrán Leyva brothers, currently fighting the Sinaloa Cartel in northern Sinaloa.

After the Japanese established the puppet Provisional Government of the Republic of China in 1938 (part of the collaborationist Republic of China from 1940 to 1945), these and other privately owned railways in the territory of Provisional Government were nationalised to create the North China Transportation Company (a subsidiary of the South Manchuria Railway, which designated these the Mikana (ミカナ) class.After the end of the Pacific War, these locomotives were passed on to the Republic of China Railway. After the establishment of the People\\'s Republic of China, China Railways designated them ㄇㄎ7 (MK7) class in 1951, and subsequently 解放7 (JF7) class in 1959; they were numbered in the 3601–3650, though the total number of engines is unknown.JF7-3608 was seen at Yanzhou in 1981.The last of these locomotives were retired in 1990. == References ==',\n",
              " 'St. Lawrence is a neighbourhood located in downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The area, a former industrial area, is bounded by Yonge, Front, and Parliament Streets, and the Canadian National railway embankment. The Esplanade off Yonge St., lined with restaurants, cafés and hotels runs through the middle of the area. In previous times, the area was sometimes referred to as \\'St. Lawrence Ward\\' or more often today as \\'St. Lawrence Market\\', synonymous with the large retail vendor market which is the neighbourhood\\'s focal point. The area is the site of a large city-sponsored housing project of the 1970s, which revitalized an old \\'brownfields\\' area. The boundaries of the St Lawrence Neighbourhood Association and the St Lawrence Market BIA are somewhat larger than those noted above. Both groups have boundaries that extend from Yonge to Parliament Streets and Queen Street East to the rail corridor. == History == The town of York was founded in 1793, on a site of ten blocks north of Front Street between George and Berkeley streets, in present day Old Town, Toronto. Much of the area of today\\'s St. Lawrence neighbourhood was then located in Toronto Harbour, the shoreline being just south of Front Street. The area was infilled to provide more land for port and industrial uses adjacent. St. Lawrence was the first industrial area of York. The first parliament buildings in Upper Canada in 1793 were constructed on the southwest corner of Parliament and Front Street. The buildings have long since gone from the site, but a discovery was made in 2000 when a quick dig of the property revealed the old parliament building footings, in addition to some pottery from that time. The City of Toronto and the Government of Ontario now own most of the property. There is a marker for the First Parliament Buildings at Parliament Square Park, West of Parliament Street, East of Berkeley, and South of Front. The marker is actually south of the original site. The Ontario Heritage Trust set up the Parliament Interpretive Centre at Front and Berkeley to provide historical information about this parliament that was destroyed by American troops during the War of 1812. The Centre was open from 2012 to 2015, in remembrance of the 200th anniversary of the war. A Saturday farmers\\' market began operation at Front and Jarvis in 1803. The current South Market building, south of Front, is open Tuesday through Saturday, selling foods and other goods. The North Market building hosted a farmers\\' market on Saturdays and a flea market on Sundays until its demolition in 2016, at which time they both moved to a temporary building south of The Esplanade. A new, larger North Market Building is being built on the original site, with planned completion in 2021. In 1834, Toronto\\'s first city hall was built on the southwest corner of King St. East & Jarvis St. at the old \\'Market\\' building from 1834 (the year of Toronto\\'s incorporation from the former town of York) to 1844. This building was damaged during the great fire of 1849 and replaced with the grandiose St. Lawrence Hall and a market building (today\\'s North Market). A larger city hall, also housing a police station and jail cells, opened in 1845 with a 140 feet (43 m) long facade running along the south side of Front Street. City Hall was moved out of the area in 1899 to what is now Old City Hall before moving once again to its current location. The 1845 city hall was integrated into the St. Lawrence Market South building in 1899. In 1972, the remains of the city hall were converted into the \"Market Gallery\". The old council chamber is all that remains of the original city hall and is located on the gallery\\'s second floor. By 1840, the waterfront was completely taken over by government and merchant wharves. The Esplanade, a 100 feet (30 m)-wide road, was proposed, just south of Front Street, with new water lots made from cribbing and filling of the shore to the south. The waterfront was extended to a survey line from the point of the Gooderham windmill west to a point due east of the old Fort Rouillé. Ostensibly for carriages and carts, the roadway eventually became primarily the route for rail lines in the central core. In exchange for 40 feet (12 m) of the Esplanade, the railways underwrote the infilling of the harbour. The Esplanade and infill project was completed by 1865.Commercial activity along Toronto\\'s bustling harbour provided employment and was the primary place of entry to the quickly growing, burgeoning city. The convergence of the railway lines and the wharves must have worked because in 1873 historian Henry Scadding so eloquently wrote in his book Old Toronto of The Esplanade \"...It has done for Toronto what the Thames Embankment has done for London...\" In the 1920s, the railway lines were relocated to a new, raised viaduct to the south of the Esplanade. This left the current section between Yonge and Berkeley Street. By the 1960s, the industrial uses of the area had declined, leaving numerous empty sites and decrepit buildings. In the 1970s it was decided by Toronto Mayor David Crombie to turn the area into a new residential neighbourhood, but one that would not make the same mistakes of the \"urban renewal\" housing projects of earlier decades. The neighbourhood was to be integrated into the city with no clear boundaries. It would contain a mix of commercial and residential as with both subsidized and market-oriented housing, mostly rowhouse or low-rise apartments. The neighbourhood was planned by Alan Littlewood and Frank Lewinberg, with the influence of American-Canadian urban planner Jane Jacobs playing a crucial role. Design guidelines prepared by Eberhard Zeidler were deemed too modern by planners and politicians and were not implemented, replaced instead by the urban design work of George Baird. Many of the developments were not completed until well into the 1990s. Since that time, the St. Lawrence neighbourhood has been critically acclaimed as a major success in urban planning. In many ways, it has become the model for the design and planning of new urban communities across North America. == Character == Some of the most interesting architecture in the city can be found in St. Lawrence, one notable landmark is the Flatiron building, known for its distinct narrow, wedge shape where Wellington St. merges with Front. Built in 1892, it was the first of this type of building constructed in North America. If viewed from the east, the wedge can be seen in the foreground with the financial skyscrapers and the CN tower rising in the background. While many of the old industrial buildings along Front Street east of Jarvis have been demolished since the 1950s, several old industrial buildings remain, including old meat-packing plants from the 1800s. Several have been converted into lofts or commercial space. Front Street is lined on both sides with restaurants. At the intersection of Front and Yonge are two performing arts houses, the St. Lawrence Centre for the Arts, Toronto\\'s \"centennial\" project and Meridian Hall. == See also == List of oldest buildings and structures in Toronto St. Lawrence Market == References == White, Richard (2011). \"Jane Jacobs and Toronto, 1968-1978\".

She studied at the Rhode Island School of Design and graduated with an undergraduate degree in graphic design in 1979. == Career == She began her career as an agent trainee for Creative Artists Agency, and as an executive for Aaron Spelling and Quincy Jones Entertainment. In 1988, she was the coordinating producer for the Fresh Prince of Bel Air and the associate producer for Satisfaction. She then wrote the screenplay Barb Wire (1996), and the television films Dirty Pictures (2000), and Damaged Care (2002). Dirty Pictures won the Golden Globe for Best Miniseries or Television Film in 2000.Chaiken co-created The L Word in 2004, inspired largely by her own experiences as a lesbian. Her first romance with another woman, which ended in heartbreak when the woman revealed she had a long-distance girlfriend, served as a loose inspiration for the relationship of the characters Marina Ferrer and Jenny Schecter.In 2007, she and a group of women in the entertainment and tech industries launched a social networking site called OurChart for lesbians and their friends. OurChart was online until 2008, when it was shutdown. At that time, a spin-off show of The L Word entitled The Farm was in development and two pilots were being written by Chaiken, although Showtime never bought the series.Chaiken produced a documentary for Showtime in 2014 titles L Word Mississippi: Hate the Sin. The film focused on multiple lesbian women, telling their experiences of being gay in the Deep South. During this time, Chaiken was also a showrunner on ABC's The Black Box, which was cancelled after one season.Chaiken is credited with first developing the TV adaptation of The Handmaid's Tale, which became a successful Hulu original show. Chaiken left the project during development to become the show-runner on Fox's Empire, but was still credited as an executive producer.In January 2019, Showtime announced that it had ordered a full season of the sequel to The L Word. The show aired December 8, 2019, titled The L Word: Generation Q, and picks up where the original series ended, set ten years later.More recently, her company, Little Chicken Productions, signed an overall deal with Universal Television. In 2020, Chaiken co-created the show Law & Order: Organized Crime, a spin-off of the long-running series Law & Order. The following year, she worked as a writer and showrunner for the series, but was replaced by Barry O'Brien part-way through production of the second season. == Personal life == Chaiken has been married to LouAnne Brickhouse, a former executive at Disney, since 2013. They live in the Laurel Canyon area of the Hollywood Hills in Los Angeles and have nurtured more than 100 species of birds and other fauna, which they document regularly on an Instagram account.Chaiken is co-parent to twin daughters Tallulah and Augusta with her former partner, English architect Miggi Hood. == Filmography == === Television === == Awards == == See also == List of female film and television directors List of lesbian filmmakers List of LGBT-related films directed by women == References == == External links == Ilene Chaiken at IMDb\",\n",

Stradiņš was the first person to use the term \"Third Awakening\" (at the expanded plenum of the Writers\\' Union of the Latvian SSR in June 1988), opposing those who had begun to call the national revival in the period of glasnost the Second Awakening (the first being that of the Young Latvians). Blanks sought to distinguish between the New Current (in Latvian: Jaunā strāva) — a broad and radical socio-economic, political, and cultural movement that lasted from the late 1880s until the 1905 Revolution, led by Rainis and influenced by Marxism — from the more nationalistic direction taken in 1903 by Ernests Rolavs and Miķelis Valters; to Blanks, the 1890s \"could be stricken completely from the history of national thought.\" He saw Rolavs\\' and Valters\\' nationalist Latvian Social Democratic Union (in Latvian: Sociāldemokratu savienība; sometimes abbreviated SDS) — a radical socialist group critical of the cosmopolitanism of the Latvian Social Democratic Workers\\' Party (Latvijas sociāldemokrātiskā strādnieku partija; LSDSP) — as the direct ideological descendants of the Young Latvians. It was the SDS (and especially Valters) that first began to formulate demands for Latvia\\'s political autonomyStradiņš based his view of the national revival in the 1980s on Blanks, considering the Second Awakening similarly: he viewed the organization of the Latvian riflemen, the activities of the Latvian émigrés in Switzerland, the Latvian refugees\\' relief committee in Russia, the proclamation of independence and the battles for independence as coming under the heading of the Second Awakening. Less frequently, some have seen the New Current and the 1905 Revolution — and sometimes even the Khrushchev Thaw — as National Awakenings. == References == == See also == Ernests Blanks: Latvju tautas ceļš uz neatkarīgu valsti.

              " 'The Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Handel, Op. 24, is a work for solo piano written by Johannes Brahms in 1861. It consists of a set of twenty-five variations and a concluding fugue, all based on a theme from George Frideric Handel\\'s Harpsichord Suite No. 1 in B♭ major, HWV 434. They are known as his Handel Variations. The music writer Donald Tovey has ranked it among \"the half-dozen greatest sets of variations ever written\". Biographer Jan Swafford describes the Handel Variations as \"perhaps the finest set of piano variations since Beethoven\", adding, \"Besides a masterful unfolding of ideas concluding with an exuberant fugue with a finish designed to bring down the house, the work is quintessentially Brahms in other ways: the filler of traditional forms with fresh energy and imagination; the historical eclectic able to start off with a gallant little tune of Handel\\'s, Baroque ornaments and all, and integrate it seamlessly into his own voice, in a work of massive scope and dazzling variety.\" == Background == The Handel Variations were written in September 1861 after Brahms, aged 28, abandoned the work he had been doing as director of the Hamburg women\\'s choir (Frauenchor) and moved out of his family\\'s cramped and shabby apartments in Hamburg to his own apartment in the quiet suburb of Hamm, initiating a highly productive period that produced \"a series of early masterworks\". Written in a single stretch in September 1861, the work is dedicated to a \"beloved friend\", Clara Schumann, widow of Robert Schumann. It was presented to her on her 42nd birthday, September 13. At about the same time, his interest in, and mastery of, the piano also shows in his writing two important piano quartets, in G minor and A major. Barely two months later, in November 1861, he produced his second set of Schumann Variations, Op. 23, for piano four hands. From his earliest years as a composer, the variation was a musical form of great interest to Brahms. Before the Handel Variations he had written a number of other sets of variations, as well as using variations in the slow movement of his Op. 1, the Piano Sonata in C major, and in other chamber works. As he appeared on the scene, variations were in decline, \"little more than a basis for writing paraphrases of favorite tunes\". In Brahms\\'s work the form once again became restored to greatness. Brahms had been emulating Baroque models for six years or more. In particular, between the time he wrote his previous Two Sets of Variations for piano, (No. 1, Eleven Variations on an Original Theme, in D major (1857) and No. 2, Fourteen Variations on a Hungarian Melody, in D major (1854)), Op. 21, and the Handel Variations, Op. 24, Brahms did a careful study of \"more rigorous, complex and historical models, among others preludes, fugues, canons and the then obscure dance movements of the Baroque period. Two gigues and two sarabandes that Brahms wrote to develop his technique are extant today. The results of these historical studies are seen in his choice of Handel for the theme, as well as his use of Baroque forms, including the Siciliana dance form (Var. 19) from the French school of Couperin and, in general, the frequent use of contrapuntal techniques in many variations. One aspect of his approach to variation writing is made explicit in a number of letters. \"In a theme for a [set of] variations, it is almost only the bass that has any meaning for me. But this is sacred to me, it is the firm foundation on which I then build my stories. What I do with a melody is only playing around ... If I vary only the melody, then I cannot easily be more than clever or graceful, or, indeed, [if] full of feeling, deepen a pretty thought. On the given bass, I invent something actually new, I discover new melodies in it, I create.\" The role of the bass is critical. Identifying the bass as the essence of the theme, ...Brahms advocated using it to control the structure and character of individual variations and of the entire set. But by this he apparently did not mean retaining in the variations the bass line of the theme or even its harmonies ... To invent something actually new and to discover new melodies in the bass give the bass a role at once passive and active. While maintaining the structure of the theme—the passive bass, so to speak—Brahms may actively create melodies and figurative patterns (including melodies \"discovered in\" the bass), project different contrapuntal textures, and draw on an expanded harmonic vocabulary, sometimes interpreting the melody as the bass of the harmony or regarding major and minor or sharp and flat versions of the same passage as equally valid and available. The result is a great diversity of expression and character founded on a relatively strict conception of the \"given\" material. Brahms also took into careful account the character of the theme, and its historical context. Unlike the great model of Beethoven\\'s Diabelli Variations, where the variations departed widely from the character of the theme, Brahms\\'s variations expressed and developed the character of the theme. Because the theme for the Handel variations originated in the Baroque era, Brahms included forms such as a siciliana, a musette, a canon and a fugue.Still not fully established in his career in 1861, Brahms had to struggle to get the work published. He wrote to Breitkopf & Härtel, \"I am unwilling, at the first hurdle, to give up my desire to see this, my favourite work, published by you. If therefore, it is primarily the high fee that stops you taking it, I will be happy to let you have it for 12 Friedrichsdors or, if this still seems too high, 10 Friedrichsdors. I very much hope you will not think I plucked the initial fee arbitrarily out of the air. I consider this work to be much better than my earlier ones; I think it is also much better adapted to the demands of performance and will therefore be easier to market ...\"The theme of the Handel Variations is taken from an aria in the third movement of Handel\\'s Harpsichord Suite No. 1 in B♭ Major, HWV 434 (Suites de pièces pour le clavecin, published by J. Walsh, London 1733 with five variations). Brahms himself owned a copy of the 1733 First Edition. The appeal of the aria for Brahms might have been its simplicity: its range is restricted to one octave; the harmony is plain, with every note taken from the B-flat major scale; it \"made an admirably neutral starting-place\". While Handel had written only five variations on his theme, Brahms, with the piano as his instrument rather than the more limited harpsichord, enlarged the scope of his opus to 25 variations ending with an extended fugue. Brahms\\'s use of Handel exemplifies his love of the music of the past and his tendency to incorporate it and transform it in his own compositions. Of the overall concept of the work, Malcolm MacDonald writes \"Some of Brahms\\'s models in this monumental work are easy enough to identify. In the scale and ambition of his conception both Bach\\'s \\'Goldberg\\' and Beethoven\\'s \\'Diabelli Variations\\' must have exercised a powerful if generalized influence; in specific features of form Beethoven\\'s \\'Eroica\\' Variations is a closer parallel. But the overall structure is original to Brahms.\" And MacDonald suggests what might have been a more contemporary source of inspiration, the Variations on a Theme of Handel, Op. 26, by Robert Volkmann. \"Brahms might well have known that large and often admirable work, published as recently as 1856, which Volkmann based on the so-called \\'Harmonious Blacksmith\\' theme from the Air with Variations in Handel\\'s E major Harpsichord Suite.\" == Structure == In Music, Imagination, and Culture Nicholas Cook gives the following concise description: \"The Handel Variations consist of a theme and twenty-five variations, each of equal length, plus a much longer fugue at the end which provides the climax of the movement in terms of duration, dynamics, and contrapuntal complexity. The individual variations are grouped in such a way as to create a series of waves, both in terms of tempo and dynamics, leading to the final fugue, and superimposed on this overall organization are a number of subordinate patterns. Variations in tonic major and minor more or less alternate with each other; only once is there a variation in another key (the twenty-first, which is in the relative minor). Legato variations are usually succeeded by staccato ones; variations whose texture is fragmentary are in general followed by more homophonic ones. ... the organization of the variation set is not so much concentric—with each variation deriving coherence from its relationship to the theme—as edge-related, with each variation being lent significance by its relationship with what comes before and after it, or by the group of variations within which it is located. In other words, what gives unity to the variation set ... is not the theme as such, but rather a network of \\'family resemblances\\', to use Wittgenstein\\'s term, between the different variations.\" There are various opinions about the organization of the Handel Variations. Hans Meyer, for example, sees the divisions as nos. 1–8 (\\'strict\\'), 9–12 (\\'free\\'), 13 (\\'synthesis\\'), 14–17 (\\'strict\\') and 18–25 (\\'free\\'), culminating in the fugue. William Horne emphasizes paired variations: nos. 3 and 4, 5 and 6, 7 and 8, 11 and 12, 13 and 14, 23 and 24. This helps him to group the set as 1–8, 9–18, 19–25, with each group ending with a fermata and preceded by one or more variation pairs. John Rink, focusing on Brahms\\'s dynamic markings, writes, \"Brahms takes pains to control the intensity level throughout the twenty-five variations, maintaining a state of flux in the first half, and then keeping the temperature perceptibly low after the peak in Variations 13–15 until the massive \\'crescendo\\' towards the fugue begins in Variation 23. We thus find a sensitivity to motion and momentum that complements—and possibly transcends in importance to the listener—the elegance of structure about which so many authors have (legitimately) enthused. Unity is maintained, at least in part, by using Handel\\'s key signature of B♭ major throughout most of the set, varied by only a few exceptions in the tonic minor, and by repeating Handel\\'s four-bar/two-part structure, including the repeats, in most of the work. === The variations === The performer of the audio files in this section is Martha Goldstein. ==== Theme. Aria ==== Handel\\'s theme is divided into two parts, each four bars in length and each repeated. The elegant aria moves in stately quarter notes in 44 time with \"a ceremonial character typical of its period\". The harmonic progressions are elementary. Every bar except one has one or two decorations. The melody consists of a one-bar figure in the right hand consisting mostly of a trill and a turn; it is repeated in a rising sequence three times followed by a fourth descending repetition; a decorative flourish finishes the first half of the variation, which is then repeated. The left hand plays solid chords in support throughout, three quarter-note chords to each bar setting the pace followed by a rhythmic eighth-note chord leading to the next bar and emphasizing its first beat. The second half follows a similar pattern, varied mainly by alterations to the turns. ==== Variation 1 ==== Brahms\\'s first variation stays close to the melody and harmonies of Handel\\'s theme while changing its character completely. It uses staccato throughout and its syncopated accents are distinctly non-Baroque. The dynamic marking poco f (a bit louder), too, clearly separates it from Handel\\'s elegant aria. In tempo the variation seems much more hurried, crisp, even dance-like; each time the right hand \"pauses\" on an eighth note, the left hand fills in with sixteenth notes. At the end of the two sections, Brahms replaces Handel\\'s decorations with brilliant up- and down-scale runs. ==== Variation 2 ==== Minor-key inflections in Variations 2 to 4 increase the distance from Handel and lay the groundwork for Variations 5 and 6, in the tonic minor. Variation 2 is a subtle piece with a flowing, lilting rhythm. Complexity is added as Brahms uses a favourite technique, found throughout his works, with triple time in one voice—in this case, triplets in the right hand—against duple time in the other. While explicitly recalling the melody of Handel\\'s theme, the chromaticism of this variation adds to the sense of a world beyond the Baroque. In the first half the pattern is of phrases rising on the scale with a crescendo, then falling away in a shorter decrescendo. The second half climbs both in pitch and dynamics to a high climax, again falling away quickly. There is a smooth transition to the next variation. ==== Variation 3 ==== The elegant third variation, marked dolce, moves at a more leisurely pace, providing a sense of calm after two rather busy variations. It also provides a much-needed contrast with the following thunderous variation. Right and left hands alternate and overlap, the left imitating the right in a pattern of three eighth notes. The first note of each group is played staccato, adding to the sense of lightness. The occasional rolled chord adds interest. ==== Variation 4 ==== The fourth variation, marked risoluto, is a showpiece, with sixteenth notes played in octaves in both hands, strong accents (the sforzandos are frequently emphasized by six-note chords) and climaxes that rise a full octave higher than Handel\\'s theme. The charging, syncopated rhythm places the stress on the last sixteenth note of almost every beat. Although no tempo indications are given, this variation is often performed at great speed. ==== Variation 5 ==== After the mighty sounds of the previous variation, the lyrical fifth variation begins quietly. The change of mood is emphasized by a shift to the tonic minor (B♭ minor). This is the first variation in a key different from Handel\\'s. Numerous small crescendos and decrescendos underscore the espressivo marking. The melody moves upward at a measured pace in eighth notes while the left hand accompanies with broken chords in sixteenth notes in contrary motion. The mood is peaceful and tranquil. A pairing between this variation and the following one is created by the use of the tonic minor key signature and contrary motion. ==== Variation 6 ==== Like the preceding variation, this piece is in the tonic minor and features contrary motion, and the motives of the two variations are similar. Marked p sempre with legato phrasing, Variation 6 has a hushed, mysterious tone. The pace is measured, as both hands are written mainly in eighth notes with short sequences of sixteenth notes providing variety. Here Brahms uses counterpoint in the form of a two-part canon in octaves, including inverted canon for several measures in the second half. ==== Variation 7 ==== Echoing the pairing of Variations 5 and 6, the seventh variation is paired with the eighth. Returning to Handel\\'s original B♭ major, Variation 7 is fast, exciting, high-spirited, and fundamentally rhythmic in nature. A sustained drumbeat effect is created by the emphatic repetition of its upper notes and a staccato rhythm throughout all three voices. Because of the repeated upper notes, the focus moves to the inner voices. Numerous accents add further emphasis to the highly rhythmic character of this variation: in some bars in the first half, accents are placed on the last beat of the bar, while in the second half, the accents are yet more numerous, assigned to every beat except the last of each bar. Each half ends in a peak of excitement, marked forte with arpeggios in contrary motion. It leads seamlessly into 8. ==== Variation 8 ==== Variation 8 continues the rhythmic excitement of Variation 7, the left hand beating out, on the same note over and over, the same anapestic rhythm as the preceding variation. After a few bars, the two voices of the right hand are flipped. A fermata at the close provides a moment of silence before 9 begins and signals the end of the first section. ==== Variation 9 ==== Variation 9 slows the pace of the series, with a sense of grandeur as both treble and bass move in stately, ominous octaves. The piece is highly chromatic, and, like several earlier variations, treble and bass are in contrary motion throughout. Each two-bar phrase begins with two exclamatory sf chords, as if sounding an alarm. The variation starts an octave higher than Handel\\'s theme, and its repeated two-bar pattern continually ascends, increasing in tension, until the climax, when it reaches a full two octaves higher than Handel. ==== Variation 10 ==== In contrast to the preceding number, Variation 10 is Allegro energico, fast and exhilarating. Its rather odd effect sounds almost devoid of melody, as the main notes of the theme are scattered among various registers. The first half consists of a series of startling gestures that begin with large, loud chords (f energetico) in the higher registers followed by echoes progressively lower, ending deep in the bass in a series of single notes played pp. The second half rushes to a great climax. ==== Variation 11 ==== After the tension of Variations 7–10, the next two variations are sweet and melodic. Variation 11 uses counterpoint and has a simple, pleasant air with its rock-steady rhythm in the right hand while the left hand simply plays two notes to one. Variations 11 and 12 are another example of the pairing of variations which is so characteristic of the work. ==== Variation 12 ==== The quietness and delicacy of Variation 12 prepares for the return of the dark tonic minor in Variation 13. The left hand is similar to Variation 17, in the same rhythm as the left hand of Handel\\'s theme. ==== Variation 13 ==== Variation 13 returns to the tonic minor in a funereal mood. It is the middle variation of the set and, in the view of Denis Matthews, the emotional centre. Right-hand sixths play against rolled chords in the left, perhaps suggesting muffled drums. For Tovey the lugubrious tone suggests a \"kind of Hungarian funeral march\", while Malcolm MacDonald sees it as \"florid\" and \"a Hungarian fantasia\". Here Brahms abandons the usual repeat signs because each passage that would have been repeated is instead written an octave higher. Variations 13 and 14, while very different in character, are paired in being fast and exciting and in their use of parallel sixths in the right hand. ==== Variation 14 ==== Variation 14, marked sciolto (\"loose\") breaks the dark mood of Variation 13 and returns to the original key. With its extended trills and scalar runs in sixths in the right hand against broken octaves in the left hand, it is a virtuoso showpiece. The mood is of great energy, excitement, and high spirits. It leads without a break into the following variation. Donald Francis Tovey sees a grouping in Variations 14–18, which he describes as \"aris[ing] one out of the other in a wonderful decrescendo of tone and crescendo of Romantic beauty\". ==== Variation 15 ==== Following without a pause from the previous number, Variation 15, marked forte, is a bravura variation building relentlessly toward an exciting climax. It consists of a one-bar pattern, varied only slightly, of two declamatory chords in eighth notes in the higher registers, followed by lower sixteenth notes that echo Handel\\'s original turns. A prominent upbeat creates syncopated energy. It has been called an étude for Brahms\\'s Piano Concerto No. 2. It breaks the structural mould of Handel\\'s theme by adding one \"extra\" bar. In Brahms\\'s first autograph, Variations 15 and 16 were positioned in the reverse order. ==== Variation 16 ==== Variation 16 continues from Variation 15 as a \"variation of variation\", repeating the pattern of two high eighth notes followed by a run of lower sixteenth notes. It also forms another pairing with Variation 17. Baroque contrapuntal techniques appear again in this canon, described by Malcolm MacDonald as \"wittier\" than the canon of Variation 6. The left hand begins with two descending staccato eighth notes, immediately followed in the opposite hand by the two eighth notes inverted, a full four octaves higher. In each case, a figure in sixteenth notes follows in canonic imitation. The effect is light and exhilarating. ==== Variation 17 ==== In Variation 17, the absence of the sixteenth notes that were so prominent in the preceding two variations gives the impression of a slowing, despite the marking of più mosso. The effect is of gently falling raindrops, with gracefully descending broken chords in the right hand, piano and staccato, repeated throughout the work at various pitches. Each note is played twice, adding to the suggestion of a leisurely pace. ==== Variation 18 ==== Another \"variation of a variation\", paired with the preceding Variation 17. The accompaniment from the previous variation, which now echoes the melody of the aria, is now syncopated and alternating between the hands, while the \"raindrops\" are replaced by sweeping arpeggios. ==== Variation 19 ==== This slow, relaxing variation, with its lilting rhythm and 128 time, is written in the dance style of a Baroque French siciliana from the school of Couperin (Brahms had edited Couperin\\'s music). It uses chords almost exclusively in the root position, perhaps as another reminiscence of \"antique\" music. In a technique often used by Brahms, the melodic line is hidden in an inner part. This variation opens a lengthy quiet section which includes nos. 19–22, \"not noticeably interrelated\". ==== Variation 20 ==== From the outset, Variation 20 builds toward its climax. In contrast to the preceding variation, there is little of the Baroque in it with its chromaticism in both treble and bass and its thick textures (triads in the right hand against octaves in the left hand). Malcolm MacDonald refers to its \"organ-loft progressions\". ==== Variation 21 ==== Variation 21 moves to the relative minor (G minor). Like Variation 19, the theme is hidden, in this case by merely gracing the main notes of the theme in passing, thereby achieving a sense of lightness. It is another example of Brahms\\' use of polyrhythms, this time pairing three notes against four. ==== Variation 22 ==== The light mood of the preceding variation continues in Variation 22. Often referred to as the \"musical-box\" variation because of the regularity of its rhythm, underlined particularly by a drone bass, Variation 22 alludes to the Baroque musette, a soft pastoral air imitating the sound music of a bagpipe, or musette. It remains in the high registers, consistently above Handel\\'s theme, the lowest note being the repeated B♭ of the drone. The light mood prepares the way for the climactic, concluding section which, in Tovey\\'s words, comes \"swarming up energetically out of darkness\". ==== Variation 23 ==== At Variation 23 the rise toward a final climax begins. It is clearly paired with the following Variation 24, which continues its pattern but in a more hurried, more urgent manner. ==== Variation 24 ==== In preparation for the climactic final variation, Variation 24 intensifies the excitement, replacing the triplets of Variation 23 with masses of sixteenth notes. Clearly modeled on the preceding, it is another example of Brahms\\'s use of \"variation of variation\". ==== Variation 25 ==== An exultant showpiece, Variation 25 ends the variations and leads into the concluding fugue. Its strong resemblance to Variation 1 ties the set together, as they both feature a left hand which fills the pauses in the right. ==== Fugue ==== The powerful concluding fugue brings the variation set to a climactic close. Its subject, repeated many times from beginning to end, derives from the opening of Handel\\'s theme. At its most microscopic level, the subject comes solely from the ascending major second from the first two beats in the top voice of Handel\\'s theme. The ascending second is stated twice in sixteenth notes and repeated again a major third higher. This parallels the first measure of Handel\\'s theme, which ascends from B♭ to C to D to E♭. The following melodic line of the second measure resembles the second measure of Handel\\'s theme in general trajectory (Brahms\\'s theme is also strikingly similar to the subject of Fugue VI from Felix Mendelssohn\\'s Six Preludes and Fugues, Op. 35, also in B♭ major). Julian Littlewood observes that the fugue has \"a dense contrapuntal argument which recalls Bach more than Handel\". Denis Matthews adds that it is \"more redolent of one of Bach\\'s great organ fugues than any in The Well-Tempered Clavier, with inversions, augmentation and double counterpoint to match, and a great peroration over a swinging dominant pedal-point\". Despite its magnitude, Littlewood suggests, the fugue avoids separation from the rest of the set by its comparable texture. \"In this way it systematically creates a web of links between past and present, achieving synthesis rather than quotation or parody.\" Michael Musgrave in The Music of Brahms writes,\"Brahms brings his subject, derived, like that of the Diabelli fugue, from the theme, into contrapuntal relationships involving diminution, augmentation, stretto, building to the final peroration through a long dominant pedal with two distinct ideas above. But the pianism is an equal part of the conception, and in this, the most complex example of Brahms\\'s virtuoso style, the characteristic spacings in thirds, sixths and wide spans between the hands are employed as never before. Indeed, the pianistic factor serves to create the great contrasts within the fugue, which transcends a traditional fugal movement to create a further set of variations, in which many of the previous textures are recalled in the context of the equally transformed fugal theme.\" == Reception and aftermath == An entry in Clara Schumann\\'s diary about the Handel Variations gives an idea of how close the relationship between her and Brahms was, as well as Brahms\\'s sometimes extraordinary insensitivity: \"On Dec 7th I gave another soirée, at which I played Johannes\\' Handel Variations. I was in agonies of nervousness, but I played them well all the same, and they were much applauded. Johannes, however, hurt me very much by his indifference. He declared that he could no longer bear to hear the variations, it was altogether too dreadful for him to listen to anything of his own and to have to sit by and do nothing. Although I can well understand this feeling, I cannot help finding it hard when one has devoted all one\\'s powers to a work, and the composer himself has not a kind word for it.\" Yet in the following spring (April 1862) Brahms wrote, in a note to a critic to whom he was sending a copy of the work, \"I am fond of it and value it particularly in relation to my other works\".Clara Schumann premiered the work in Hamburg on December 7, when she visited Brahms\\'s home town to give a series of performances, which also included the Piano Concerto No. 1 in D minor—which had not been well received when Brahms introduced it to Leipzig in the Gewandhaus in January 1858—and the premiere of the Piano Quartet No. 1 in G minor. Clara\\'s performance of the Handel Variations in Hamburg was a triumph, which she repeated soon afterward in Leipzig. During that winter, Brahms also gave performances of the Handel Variations, as a result of which he made minor alterations to the score. Publication came in July 1862 by Breitkopf & Härtel. With the \"complete failure,\" as he described it to Clara, of his first large-scale orchestral work, the First Piano Concerto, the Handel Variations became an important landmark in the developing career of Brahms. Another seven years passed before his reputation was firmly established by A German Requiem in Bremen in 1868, and it took a full fifteen years before he made his mark as a symphonist with his first symphony (1876). During what was probably the first meeting of Brahms and Richard Wagner in January 1863, Brahms performed his Handel Variations. Despite the great differences between the two men in musical style and an underlying tension based on musical politics—Brahms championing a more conservative approach to music while Wagner, along with Franz Liszt, called for \"the music of the future\" with new forms and new tonalities—Wagner complimented the work graciously, if not wholeheartedly, saying, \"One sees what still may be done in the old forms when someone comes along who knows how to use them\". == Arrangements == The piece is often heard in a version that was arranged for orchestra by the British composer and Brahms enthusiast Edmund Rubbra in 1938. The orchestration was first performed at a Royal Philharmonic Society concert conducted by Adrian Boult. The ballet Brahms/Handel, made by New York City Ballet balletmaster Jerome Robbins in collaboration with Twyla Tharp, was set to this orchestration. The work has also been transcribed for solo organ by French-Canadian composer Rachel Laurin. == Notes == == External links == Variations on a Theme by Händel Op.24 (Brahms, Johannes): Scores at the International Music Score Library Project Free score Detailed listening guide based on a recording by Martin Jones Sleeve notes from a recording by Seta Tanyel (free registration required) Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Handel played by Leon Fleisher Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Handel on YouTube played by Murray Perahia',\n",

              " 'Cow, also titled Only Stwpd Cowz Txt N Drive, is a 30-minute public information film directed by Peter Watkins-Hughes with assistance from Gwent Police and Tredegar Comprehensive School in Wales. The August 2009 film was a co-production by Gwent Police and Tred Films, with special effects by Zipline Creative Limited. The film features original music by Stuart Fox, a composer and sound designer from Gloucester, England. A previous film, \"Lucky Luke,\" was intended to warn about the dangers of joyriding; \"Cow\" was intended to be a sequel of sorts. The film was shown to students in the UK and was released on YouTube. The film, using local drama students as actors, tells the story of 17-year-old Cassie \"Cow\" Cowan (Jenny Davies), who texts and drives and gets into a car accident; her friends Emm and Jules (Amy Ingram and Laura Quantick) are in the vehicle with her. Four people die as a result of Cassie\\'s actions. The police intended for the film to be aired in British schools.The film cost \\'a few thousand pounds\\' to make. 300 drama students auditioned for the film.The full film is shown to students in the United Kingdom. As of 2009 the film had not been aired on television stations in the United States. In 2010, a modified 30-second version of the public service announcement was to begin airing during certain hours on 13 television stations in central and upstate South Carolina. == Story == Cassie \"Cow\" Cowan, Emma \"Emm\" Williams, and Jules O\\'Shea, three teenage friends who work at the same hardware shop, agree to leave work early in order to cheer up Jules, who threw up on duty after discovering that she was pregnant. On the way home, Cassie texts while driving and her car drifts across the road and collides head-on with an inattentive driver on the outskirts of Tredegar, Gwent. Subsequently, a third driver crashes into them. Emma and Jules are killed in the accident, along with a couple in the second vehicle involved in the crash, while the couple\\'s young son sustains several injuries but survives. It is not clear what the outcome is for the third driver or a young baby of the second driver. The rest of the film depicts the accident\\'s aftermath and consequences. The police break the news to bereaved relatives, and Cassie herself almost dies in hospital, but is revived. At the hospital, Cassie\\'s father meets the grandmother of the couple\\'s son. When a local paper reports that she was breathalyzed shortly before the accident, her parents are ostracised by the local community (she was stopped by the police for speeding, but passed the test). Jules\\' boyfriend Morgan appears on television to express his grief about the death of their unborn baby, although he had previously dumped her because of the pregnancy. Eventually, despite her mother\\'s reassurances, Cassie is sentenced to seven years imprisonment for causing death by dangerous driving. == Reception == The clip of the public service announcement received worldwide attention, and the clip received over one million views on YouTube by 25 August 2009 and reuploaded on 28 May 2016. The video received attention due to the graphic content. The film earned honours in the Advertising Age\\'s weekly Creativity Top 5 video. and became an overnight worldwide internet hit after being shown on the US The Today Show television show.Donny Deutsch, advertising executive and American TV host, said \"I will show this to every kid I know, and I salute the police department\" and \"I would really implore various local stations: Run this stuff, put this on the air. It will help.\" Mick Giannasi, the then chief constable of Gwent Police, said \"The messages contained in the film are as relevant to the people of Tennessee as they are to the residents of Tredegar.\" He also said \"Texting and driving can have tragic consequences, and the more this film is viewed, the better.\"The part of the film with the crash was edited on YouTube in 2022 as part of the longrunning trend featuring American rapper Cupcakke, interpolating her sexualised lyrics into popular culture references. The scenario where Cassie was texting was replaced with getting distracted by a Cupcakke remix whilst driving, then showing the crash scene, with the song Into You by Ariana Grande mixed with Cupcakke\\'s lyrics such as \\'put it down my butt\\' and \\'breastfeeding while we f**ck\\'. == Cast == Jenny Davies – Cassie \"Cow\" Cowan Amy Ingram – Emma \"Emm\" Williams Laura Quantick – Jules O\\'Shea Roger Evans – Michael Cowan Adrienne O\\'Sullivan – Laura Cowan Phylip Harries – Mr. Williams Jason May – Mr. O\\'Shea Gareth Price Stevens – Morgan Davis Margaret John – Joyce Richards == References == == External links == Cow at IMDb \"Graphic Texting & Driving PSA.\" – CBS News (WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT) \"Shocking Video Warning To Teen Drivers.\" – WXII',\n",

Among the most lauded and most notable players the school has produced are Maxie Baughan, Calvin Johnson, Demaryius Thomas, Keith Brooking, Joe Hamilton, Joe Guyon, Pat Swilling and Billy Shaw. In the 21st century, Georgia Tech has won their Coastal Division and appeared in the ACC Championship Game four times since 2006. In addition to its conference and national championships, legendary coaches, and talented players, Tech\\'s football program has been noted for its many historic traditions and improbable game finishes throughout the years, including its famed fight song Ramblin\\' Wreck from Georgia Tech and its famous blocked field goal return against No. 9 Florida State in 2015. == History == === Early history (1892–1944) === Tech began its football program with several students forming a loose-knit troop of footballers called the Blacksmiths. On November 5, 1892, Tech played its first football game against Mercer University. The team lost to Mercer 12–6 in Macon, Georgia. Tech played two other games during their first season and lost both of them for a season record of 0–3. Discouraged by these results, the Blacksmiths sought a coach to improve their record. Leonard Wood, an Army officer and Atlantan, heard of Tech\\'s football struggles and volunteered to player-coach the team. Over the span of 1892–1903, Tech only won 8 games, tied in 5, and lost 32. In 1893, Tech played against the University of Georgia for the first time. Tech defeated Georgia 28–6 for the school\\'s first-ever victory. The angry Georgia fans threw stones and other debris at the Tech players during and after the game. The poor treatment of the Blacksmiths by the Georgia faithful gave birth to the rivalry now known as Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate. In 1902, Jesse Thrash was the team\\'s first All-Southern selection. He began the season as a sub and closed it as the undisputed star of the Tech team. Oliver Jones Huie was selected by Ga Tech\\'s athletic association to coach the football team for the 1903 season when the team won 3 and lost 5 games. A professional coach was desperately needed if Tech wished to build a truly competitive football program. The first game of the 1903 season was a 73–0 destruction at the hands of John Heisman\\'s Clemson; shortly after the season, Tech offered Heisman a coaching position. John Heisman put together 16 consecutive non-losing seasons, amassed 104 wins, including three undefeated campaigns and a 32-game undefeated streak. From 1915 to 1918 Georgia Tech went 30–1–2 and outscored opponents 1611–93 utilizing his jump shift offense. He would also muster a 5-game winning streak against the hated Georgia Bulldogs from 1904 to 1908 before incidents led up to the cutting of athletic ties with Georgia in 1919. Heisman was hired by Tech for $2,250 a year and 30% of the home ticket sales. Heisman would not disappoint the Tech faithful as his first season was an 8–1–1 performance, the first winning season since 1893. One source relates: \"The real feature of the season was the marvelus advance made by the Georgia School of Technology which burst from fetters that kept it in the lowest class for ten years.\" His team posted victories over Georgia, Tennessee, University of Florida at Lake City, and Cumberland, and a tie with his last employer, Clemson. He suffered just one loss, to another first year coach, Mike Donahue of Auburn. The 1905 team went 6–0–1. The 1906 team beat Auburn for the first time. Stars of this early period for Tech include Lob Brown and Billy Wilson. The 1907 and 1908 teams were led by \"Twenty Percent\" Davis. Pat Patterson was All-Southern in 1910. Patterson was captain in 1911, a season in which future coach William Alexander was a reserve quarterback. Heisman helped students construct Grant Field in 1913, when Alf McDonald was quarterback. The 1915 team went undefeated. Arguably the most notable game of Heisman\\'s career was the most lopsided victory in college football history. In 1916, Cumberland College ended its football program and attempted to cancel a scheduled game with Heisman\\'s Jackets. Heisman, however, was seeking vengeance for a 22–0 baseball loss to Cumberland in the spring of 1916, a game in which Heisman suspected Cumberland of hiring professional players to pose as Cumberland students. Heisman refused the game\\'s cancellation and Cumberland mustered up a group of commonfolk to play Tech. Tech won 222–0. Neither team achieved a first down other than a touchdown, as Cumberland either punted or turned the ball over before a first down and Tech scored on almost every play from scrimmage. Jim Preas, Tech\\'s kicker, kicked 16 point after tries, which is still a record for a single game. In 1917 Tech won its first national championship behind the backfield of Everett Strupper, Joe Guyon, Al Hill, and Judy Harlan. It was the first national title for a Southern team, and for many years the \"Golden Tornado\" was considered the finest team the region ever produced. Strupper and captain Walker Carpenter were the first two players from the Deep South ever selected first-team All-American. Heisman challenged Pop Warner\\'s undefeated Pittsburgh team to a decisive national championship game, but he declined. In the next season of 1918, Tech lost a lopsided game to Pitt 32–0. Center Bum Day became the first player from the south selected for Walter Camp\\'s first team. In 1919, Auburn upset Tech for the SIAA crown. By 1919, Heisman had divorced his wife and felt that he would embarrass his wife socially if he remained in Atlanta. Heisman moved to Pennsylvania, leaving Tech in the hands of William Alexander.William Alexander had attended Georgia Tech and after graduating as valedictorian of his class in 1912, taught mathematics at Tech and served as Heisman\\'s assistant coach. In 1920, he was given the job of head coaching Tech\\'s football team. Alexander retained Heisman\\'s \\'jump shift\\' offense, and in his first season he saw Tech win an SIAA title behind captain Buck Flowers, the first Georgia Tech player inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. Tech suffered its only loss again to Warner\\'s Pitt, and finished the season with a win over rival Auburn. Tackle Bill Fincher made Camp\\'s first team All-America. The 1921 and 1922 teams also claimed SIAA titles. The 1921 team suffered its only loss to undefeated, eastern power Penn State. Tech was captained by fullback Judy Harlan. Future Tech fullback Sam Murray was asked about a certain strong runner in the 1930s, \"He\\'s good. But if I were playing again, I would have one wish – never to see bearing down upon me a more fearsome picture of power than Judy Harlan blocking for Red Barron.\" Barron ran for 1,459 yards on the season. From 1923 to 1925, though Tech failed to claim a conference title, it had one of its best-ever players: fullback Doug Wycoff, \"the outstanding back of the South for the past two years.\" Coach Alexander recalled \"The work of Douglas Wycoff against Notre Dame two years in succession was brilliant in the extreme, as was his plunging against Penn. State when we defeated them twice.\" Tech and UGA renewed their annual rivalry game in 1925 after an eight-year hiatus. Quarterback Ike Armstrong thought the game clock read five seconds remaining in the game when in actuality it was five minutes. Williams set up his offense for a field goal and kicked it to put Tech up 3–0 on first down. Luckily for Williams, Tech won 3–0. In 1927, Alexander instituted \"the Plan.\" Georgia was highly rated to start the 1927 season, known as the \"dream and wonder team\", and justified their rating throughout the season going 9–0 in their first 9 games. Alexander\\'s plan was to minimize injuries by benching his starters early no matter the score of every game before the UGA finale. On December 3, 1927, UGA rolled into Atlanta on the cusp of a national and conference title. Tech\\'s well rested starters were helped by the rain and shut out the Bulldogs 12–0, ending any chance of UGA\\'s first national title, while netting the SIAA title. Alexander\\'s 1928 team amassed a perfect record and won the school\\'s second national title. The team was led at center by captain Peter Pund and upset Notre Dame. \"I sat at Grant Field and saw a magnificent Notre Dame team suddenly recoil before the furious pounding of one man–Pund, center\", said legendary coach Knute Rockne. \"Nobody could stop him. I counted 20 scoring plays that this man ruined.\" The 1928 team was also the very first Tech team to attend a bowl game. The team was invited to the Rose Bowl to play California. The game was a defensive struggle, with the first points scored after a Georgia Tech fumble. The loose ball was scooped up by California center Roy Riegels and then accidentally returned in the wrong direction. Riegels returned the ball all the way to California\\'s 3-yard line. After Riegels was finally stopped by his own teammate at the 1-yard line, he was swarmed by a group of Tech players. The Bears opted to punt from the end zone. The punt was blocked and converted by Tech into a safety giving Tech a 2–0 lead. Cal scored a touchdown and a point after but Tech would score another touchdown to win the game 8–7. This victory made Tech the 10–0 undefeated national champion of 1928. Coach Alexander found campus spirit to be particularly low during the Great Depression. His football program (and the other athletic teams) had very few student fans attending the games. He helped to establish a spirit organization known as the Yellow Jacket Club in 1930 to bolster student spirit. The group would later become the Ramblin\\' Reck Club. Georgia Tech football declined following the 1928 championship, and did not post another winning record until 1937. The 1939 team was SEC co-champion. The only retired jersey in Georgia Tech football history is No. 19. The number belonged to Tech halfback Clint Castleberry. Castleberry played on the No. 5 ranked 1942 Tech team as a true freshman and was third place in the 1942 Heisman Trophy voting. After ending his freshman year at Tech, Castleberry elected to join the war effort and signed up for the Army Air Corps. While co-piloting a B-26 Marauder over Africa, Castleberry, his crew, and another B-26 disappeared and were never heard from again. Castleberry has been memorialized on Grant Field ever since, with a prominent No. 19 on display in the stadium. The 1943 and 1944 teams won SEC titles. Coach Alexander finally retired in 1944 after winning 134 games as head coach and taking Tech to the Rose Bowl, Orange Bowl, Cotton Bowl Classic, and Sugar Bowl. To this day, Alexander has the second most victories of any Tech football coach. The record for most coaching victories in Tech history is still held by Alexander\\'s then coordinator and eventual successor Bobby Dodd. === Bobby Dodd era (1945–1966) === President Blake R Van Leer believed athletics were an important part of collegiate life, he championed that belief with coaches like Dodd where he was recorded being proud of Dodd\\'s accomplishments. Bobby Dodd took over the Georgia Tech football program following Coach Alexander\\'s retirement in 1944. He did not believe in intense physical practices but rather precise and well executed practices. Dodd\\'s philosophy translated to winning. He set the record for career wins at Tech at 165 career coaching wins including a 31-game winning streak from 1951 to 1952. He also managed to capture two Southeastern Conference Titles and the 1952 National Title, which concluded a 12–0 perfect season and Sugar Bowl conquest of previously undefeated, seventh ranked Ole Miss in a season that also included victories over Orange Bowl champions, 9th ranked, Alabama; 15th ranked Gator Bowl champions Florida Gators football; 16th ranked Duke; and a 7–4 rival Georgia. While 9–0 Michigan State would capture the AP and UP titles, the Yellow Jackets\\' were ranked first in the International News Service poll. Dodd also understood the deep-seated rivalry with the University of Georgia. His teams won 8 games in a row over the Bulldogs from 1949 to 1956 outscoring the Bulldogs 176–39 during the winning streak. This 8–game winning streak against Georgia remains the longest winning streak by either team in the series. Dodd would finish his career with a 12–9 record against the Bulldogs. In 1956, much controversy preceded the 1956 Sugar Bowl. Segregationists tried to keep Pitt fullback/linebacker Bobby Grier from playing because he was black. Georgia’s governor publicly threatened to remove funding if Georgia Tech’s president Blake R. Van Leer did not cancel the game. Dodd backed Van Leer in his desire to move forward with the game. Ultimately, Bobby Grier played making this the first integrated Sugar Bowl and is regarded as the first integrated bowl game in the Deep South.Dodd\\'s tenure included Georgia Tech\\'s withdrawal from the Southeastern Conference. The initial spark for Dodd\\'s withdrawal was a historic feud with Alabama Crimson Tide Coach Bear Bryant. The feud began when Tech was visiting the Tide at Legion Field in Birmingham in 1961. After a Tech punt, Alabama fair-caught the ball. Chick Granning of Tech was playing coverage and relaxed after the signal for the fair catch. Darwin Holt of Alabama continued play and smashed his elbow into Granning\\'s face causing severe fracturing in his face, a broken nose, and blood-filled sinuses. Granning was knocked unconscious and suffered a severe concussion, the result of which left him unable to play football ever again. Dodd sent Bryant a letter asking Bryant to suspend Holt after game film indicated Holt had intentionally injured Granning. Bryant never suspended Holt. The lack of discipline infuriated Dodd and sparked Dodd\\'s interest in withdrawing from the SEC. Another issue of concern for Dodd was Alabama\\'s and other SEC schools\\' over-recruitment of players. Universities would recruit more players than they had roster space for. During the summer practice sessions, the teams in question would cut the players well after signing day thus preventing the cut players from finding new colleges to play for. Dodd appealed the SEC administration to punish the \"tryout camps\" of his fellow SEC members but the SEC did not. Finally, Dodd withdrew Georgia Tech from the SEC in 1964. Tech would remain an independent like Notre Dame and Penn State (at the time) during the final four years of Dodd\\'s coaching tenure. In 1967, Dodd passed the head coach position to his favorite coordinator, Bud Carson. Dodd simply retained his athletic director position, which he had acquired in 1950. He would not retire from athletic directing until 1976. === Bud Carson era (1967–1971) === Bud Carson was Tech\\'s defensive coordinator in 1966. His job was to appease the Tech fan base Bobby Dodd had accumulated. Carson was not the charismatic leader like Dodd but rather a strategy man that enjoyed intense game planning. Carson\\'s most notable achievements included recruiting Tech\\'s first ever African American scholarship athlete and being the first Tech head coach to be fired. Carson recruited Eddie McAshan to play quarterback in 1970. After several Summer practices, McAshan won the starting quarterback job and became the first African American quarterback to start for a major Southeastern university. This decision initially polarized Georgia Tech\\'s fan base, but after winning his first 4 starts and leading Tech to a 9–3 season after three straight 4–6 seasons, McAshan won the hearts of the Tech faithful. McAshan\\'s besting of UGA in the annual rivalry game made McAshan a fixture on campus. The following season, however, led to Carson\\'s demise. In 1971, Tech went 6–6 and a fan base used to Bobby Dodd\\'s 8 wins per season average forced Carson out by James E. Boyd\\'s hand. Carson went on to form the Steel Curtain Pittsburgh Steelers defense. === Bill Fulcher era (1972–1973) === Bill Fulcher supplanted Bud Carson. Fulcher appeared to be the right choice but quit after two seasons, overwhelmed by racial incidents. Fulcher\\'s tenure included a terrible feud with Eddie McAshan, which peaked before the 1972 UGA game. McAshan had requested additional tickets for the game so that his family could attend. Fulcher refused the ticket request and McAshan sat out of practice in protest. Fulcher responded by suspending the quarterback for the UGA game and the upcoming Liberty Bowl. The story exploded on the national scene when Jesse Jackson attended the UGA game, allowing McAshan to sit with him outside of the stadium in protest. === Pepper Rodgers era (1974–1979) === Pepper Rodgers was hired soon after Fulcher quit. Rodgers was hired away from the UCLA Bruins and like Carson and Fulcher, simply could not return Tech to its national prominence of Dodd\\'s era, and after six seasons, Rodgers had accumulated only 34 wins and barely a 50% winning percentage. Rodgers flamboyant demeanor shortened his welcome at the school, and Athletic Director Doug Weaver replaced him with Bill Curry. Homer Rice became Athletic Director and attempted to reinvigorate Tech\\'s program by joining the Atlantic Coast Conference in 1980. === Bill Curry era (1980–1986) === Bill Curry had no experience as a head coach but was a refreshing change after the flamboyant Rodgers. Curry\\'s early years saw Tech reach its lowest point in modern history. His first two Tech teams from 1980 to 1981 went 2–19–1, with the only bright spots being a brilliant 24–21 victory over Bear Bryant\\'s Alabama team at Legion Field to open the 1981 season and a 3–3 slug fest in 1980 with then No.1 rated Notre Dame at Grant Field. Things had gotten so bad, they could only get better. He slowly rebuilt the team, restored a winning mentality to the Georgia Tech fan base, and in 1985 Tech won 9 games, including a 17–14 victory over Michigan State in the All American Bowl. Tech\\'s 1984–1985 teams featured the \"Black Watch\" defense. The Black Watch defense was created by defensive coordinator Don Lindsey and featured linebackers Ted Roof and Jim Anderson, safety Mark Hogan, and lineman Pat Swilling. The elite defensive players were awarded black stripes down the center of their helmets and black GT emblems on the side of their helmets. Curry\\'s leadership and ability to build a winning program sparked interest from the Crimson Tide and Alabama hired Curry away from Tech in 1986. === Bobby Ross era (1987–1991) === After Curry\\'s departure, Tech hired the talented Maryland Terrapins Coach Bobby Ross, who departed a Maryland athletic program in turmoil after the Len Bias tragedy. Bobby Ross came from Maryland after winning three ACC titles over four years. Ross\\' first season at Tech experienced a severe talent vacuum after Curry\\'s departure, and the players Ross inherited resisted the changes he demanded. The team only won two games, and Ross contemplated ending his coaching career after a humbling loss to Wake Forest in 1987. Ross decided to remain at Tech and continued to rebuild Tech\\'s program. The turning point came in 1989 with the recruitment of Shawn Jones and several other key freshman. After two seasons and only five total wins, Jones helped the Jackets rebound at the end of the 1989 season. In Jones\\' sophomore season, Tech powered through their schedule and won the ACC. The four-game unbeaten streak in 1989 extended all the way through 1990 and into the 1991 Citrus Bowl. The key victory in the streak was a huge 41–38 come from behind upset victory over then No.1 ranked Virginia in Charlottesville before a nationwide TV audience. Tech demolished Nebraska 45–21 in the 1991 Citrus Bowl, finishing the season 11–0–1, and earning a share of the 1990 National Title with the Colorado Buffaloes. Tech\\'s winning streak ended against Penn State in the 1991 Kick Off Classic. Ross and Jones never replicated that 1990 season but managed to win 8 games in 1991 making Shawn Jones one of the most heralded quarterbacks in Tech history. Ross was offered a head coach position after the 1991 season for the San Diego Chargers, which he took. === Bill Lewis era (1992–1994) === After first considering Ross assistant coaches, Ralph Friedgen and George O\\'Leary, Tech hired Bill Lewis away from East Carolina soon after Ross\\' departure. When Lewis was hired, the Tech faithful hoped he would continue to build on Ross\\' success. He had just led East Carolina to an 11–1 record and a final ranking of ninth in the nation. However, Lewis\\' first season at Tech in 1992 saw the Jackets collapse to only a 5–6 record just two years removed from a national championship. Preseason All-American Shawn Jones suffered from nagging injuries, leaving Tech\\'s offense inept. After Jones\\' fourth year ran out, redshirt freshman Donnie Davis stepped in to fill his shoes in 1993, which saw another 5–6 season. In just two years, Lewis had completely squandered the successful momentum established by Bobby Ross. During the Summer of \\'94, George O\\'Leary was rehired as defensive coordinator. With Davis injured in spring practice, Lewis recruited Tom Luginbill as his replacement. Luginbill was a proficient passer at Palomar College, a junior college in California, and his first two games in 1994 showed promise. Tech almost upset Arizona who was projected as the No. 1 team in the nation by Sports Illustrated and won 45–26 over Western Carolina. However, Tech lost its next six games before Lewis was fired with three games remaining in the season. O\\'Leary was named interim coach for the rest of the season. === George O\\'Leary era (1994–2001) === Georgia Tech lost their final three games, including a 48–10 drubbing at the hands of Georgia. Despite this, Tech dropped the \"interim\" tag from O\\'Leary\\'s title and named him head coach in 1995. O\\'Leary\\'s first season saw Senior Donnie Davis return as starter and Tech won 6 games. O\\'Leary\\'s second season saw the emergence of Joe Hamilton as starter when Brandon Shaw struggled in his first two starts. Hamilton would eventually lead the Jackets back to bowl contention and Tech attended its first bowl in six years, the 1997 Carquest Bowl. Hamilton\\'s prowess as a runner and passer thrilled the Georgia Tech fans. Offensive coordinator Ralph Friedgen utilized a complex offense with Hamilton that featured option football mixed in with complex timing routes. Hamilton racked up yardage, touchdowns, and wins for Tech. In 1998, Hamilton and Tech\\'s high powered offense won 10 games and a season ending victory over Notre Dame in the Gator Bowl. Hamilton\\'s senior year put him on the national stage. He was a leading candidate for the Heisman Trophy against rushing phenomenon Ron Dayne. Hamilton passed for over 3,000 yards and rushed for over 700 yards. But while Hamilton dazzled, the Georgia Tech defense was a liability (they allowed around 28 points per game), and may have ultimately cost Hamilton the 1999 Heisman Trophy. In a late-season, nationally televised game against Wake Forest, Tech gave up 26 points and Hamilton threw two interceptions and no touchdowns. As an indirect result, Dayne went on to win the Heisman (Joe was runner-up). Hamilton\\'s Georgia Tech career ended on a sour note in the 2000 Gator Bowl against the Miami, where the Jackets lost 28–13. The following season, redshirt junior George Godsey, a more traditional pocket passer, succeeded Hamilton at the helm of Tech\\'s powerful offense. The drop-off was minimal—Godsey continued where Hamilton left off, winning 9 games in 2000 and 8 games in 2001. In 2000, Godsey also led Tech to their third straight victory over the archrival Georgia Bulldogs.The end of the 2001 season saw George O\\'Leary entertain a coaching offer from Notre Dame after Bob Davie announced resignation as Irish head coach. O\\'Leary was eventually awarded the position, but it was revoked shortly thereafter when Notre Dame discovered that O\\'Leary had fabricated several aspects of his resume. He claimed to have played three years for the University of New Hampshire and to have attained a master\\'s degree from New York University; in actuality, he had attended NYU but did not graduate, and he never played a down of New Hampshire football. Following O\\'Leary\\'s departure, Mac McWhorter was named interim head coach for Georgia Tech\\'s bowl game, a victory over Stanford in the 2001 Seattle Bowl. === Chan Gailey era (2002–2007) === The following spring, Chan Gailey was hired to replace O\\'Leary as Georgia Tech\\'s head coach. Chan Gailey came to Georgia Tech in 2002 after head coaching stints with the Dallas Cowboys, Samford Bulldogs, and Troy Trojans. Gailey\\'s first team in 2002 managed to win seven games under the quarterbacking of A.J. Suggs. The most notable game of the 2002 season was an upset of National Title Contender North Carolina State. Georgia Tech rallied in the fourth quarter to upset NC State and end Philip Rivers\\'s Heisman Trophy hopes. In 2003, eleven Georgia Tech players were found academically ineligible. Despite the academic losses and the playing of true freshman Reggie Ball, Gailey would lead Tech to a seven-win season and humiliation of Tulsa in the Humanitarian Bowl. P.J. Daniels racked up over 300 yards rushing in the effort. 2004 and 2005 saw Georgia Tech improve talent and skill wise but Tech won seven games again. Star Calvin Johnson arrived as a true freshman in 2004. His performance against Clemson in 2004 helped cement Johnson\\'s place in the annals of all-time Tech greats. Two off-the-field problems affected the Yellow Jackets\\' 2005 season. First, Reuben Houston, a starting cornerback, was arrested for possession of over 100 pounds of marijuana. Houston was dismissed from the football team immediately following this arrest but a later court order forced Coach Gailey to allow Houston to return to the team. Houston would see little playing time following the court order. At the end of the 2005 season, an NCAA investigation found that 11 ineligible players had played for the Yellow Jackets between the 1998 and 2005 seasons. These players played while not making progress towards graduation on the NCAA-approved schedule. The football victories for that season were initially revoked, and Georgia Tech was put on two years of NCAA probation. Twelve football scholarships were stricken from Georgia Tech\\'s allotment for the 2006 and 2007 freshman classes. The Georgia Tech Athletic Department appealed this decision by the NCAA, and the records were restored but scholarship reductions and probation remained. Athletic Director Dave Braine retired in January 2006, and Dan Radakovich was hired as Athletic Director. Gailey\\'s most successful year at Georgia Tech was in 2006 with nine victories and the ACC Coastal Division championship. The Yellow Jackets football team reached its first New Year\\'s Bowl since the 1999 Gator Bowl and played the West Virginia Mountaineers in the Gator Bowl. Tashard Choice led the ACC in rushing yards and Calvin Johnson led the ACC in receptions and receiving yardage. After an impressive 33–3 victory at Notre Dame to open the 2007 season, the team slid to finish 7–6. On the morning of Monday, November 26, 2007, Gailey was fired from the Yellow Jackets, two days after another heartbreaking loss to the University of Georgia. The Yellow Jackets\\' Athletic Department hired Paul Johnson, then the head coach at Navy and former Georgia Southern head coach, as Gailey\\'s replacement on December 7, 2007. === Paul Johnson era (2008–2018) === On Friday, December 7, 2007, less than two weeks after Georgia Tech announced the firing of Chan Gailey, Paul Johnson was announced as the new Georgia Tech head football coach. Johnson was hired under a seven-year contract worth more than $11 million. Johnson immediately began installing his unique flexbone option offense at Georgia Tech. By the regular season\\'s end, Johnson had led the Yellow Jackets to a 9–3 record including an ACC Coastal Division Co-Championship and a 45–42 win in Athens, Georgia over arch-rival UGA, Tech\\'s first win against the Bulldogs since 2000. In recognition of his accomplishments in his first season, Johnson was named 2008 ACC Coach of the Year by the Atlantic Coast Sports Media Association as well as the CBSSports.com coach of the year. Several weeks after Johnson\\'s defeat of rival Georgia, Georgia Tech rewarded Johnson with a new contract worth $17.7 million, a 53% raise that made him the second highest paid coach in the ACC before he had even completed his first year in the conference. In 2009, Johnson led the Yellow Jackets to historic wins over Florida State in Tallahassee, No. 4 Virginia Tech (breaking an 0–17 losing streak to top five opponents at Grant Field in the past 47 years), and Virginia in Charlottesville. The jackets went on to defeat the Clemson Tigers to make them ACC champions, a title that would be vacated on July 14, 2011, due to NCAA infractions. The Yellow Jackets went on to lose to Iowa in the Orange Bowl, 24–14. Georgia Tech had another significant win over the No. 5 Clemson Tigers on October 29, 2011, giving the Tigers their first defeat of the season and enabling QB Tevin Washington to rush for 176 yards on 27 carries and a touchdown, breaking a school record. In 2012, Georgia Tech was declared the winner of the ACC Coastal Division on November 19, 2012, clinching it with a victory over Duke 42–24 and finishing with a 5-3 ACC record. Georgia Tech played against Florida State in the 2012 ACC Championship Game, which was coach Paul Johnson\\'s second appearance in the title game. The Yellow Jackets lost to the Seminoles 21–15. The 2014 Yellow Jackets, despite being predicted to finish 5th in Coastal Division by ESPN, garnered a 10–2 regular season record (6-2 ACC), including wins over then No. 19 Clemson and No. 9 Georgia to finish the regular season ranked No. 11 by the recently created College Football Playoff Committee. The highlight of the season was an overtime thriller that lead to the defeat of the Bulldogs in Athens, featuring Harrison Butker\\'s 53-yard field goal that sent the game into overtime, a 1-yard rushing touchdown by RB Zack Laskey, and a game clinching interception of UGA quarterback Hutson Mason\\'s throw by cornerback D.J. White. Georgia Tech met No. 4 Florida State in the 2014 ACC Championship Game in Charlotte, North Carolina, losing 37–35. Following their conference championship, Florida State was chosen in the top four (ranked No. 3), under which circumstance the Orange Bowl selected Georgia Tech (now No. 12) as its replacement to face the No. 7 Mississippi State Bulldogs on December 31, 2014. Justin Thomas led the Jackets to a dominating 49–34 win for the Yellow Jackets, finishing the season 11–3, No. 8 in AP poll and No. 7 in the American Coaches Poll. The 2015 season showed the Yellow Jackets a 3–9 record, after numerous injuries throughout the entire year. Their only notable win was a 22–16 upset over No. 9 Florida State on Tech\\'s Homecoming Night, when the Yellow Jackets blocked an attempted field goal by Florida State Kicker Roberto Aguayo, which was picked up by Lance Austin and returned for the game-winning touchdown. This was later coined the \"Miracle on Techwood Drive\". 2015 year marked the first year since 1996 that Georgia Tech did not make a bowl appearance. The next year, 2016, marked a bounce-back season, with the Yellow Jackets, led by team captain Justin Thomas, posting a 9–4 record, including a win over Kentucky in the TaxSlayer Bowl. 2016 also saw a 28–27 victory over Georgia in Athens featuring a 14-point comeback in the 4th quarter topped off by a 6-yard TD rush on third down by Qua Searcy, with 30 seconds left in the game. The Yellow Jackets took a step back in 2017, finishing 5–6 (4–4 ACC) with close losses to Tennessee (42–41 in 2OT) at the Chick Fil A Kickoff Game in the newly constructed Mercedes-Benz Stadium, and at Miami (25–24). Despite starting the 2018 season 1–3, the Yellow Jackets rallied to finish the regular season 7–5. The most notable victory was that against rival Virginia Tech, making Georgia Tech the only conference opponent to win three consecutive games in Lane Stadium against Virginia Tech. The season ended with the 2018 Quick Lane Bowl, where the Jackets fell 34–10 to the Minnesota Golden Gophers. Johnson announced his retirement on November 28, 2018, effective following the team\\'s bowl game. Geoff Collins was named Johnson\\'s replacement on December 7, 2018. === Geoff Collins era (2019–2022) === Geoff Collins was announced on December 7, 2018, as the new head coach, to replace the retiring Paul Johnson, starting the 2019 season. Collins was hired under a seven-year contract worth more than $23 million. Geoff Collins, a native of Conyers, Georgia, was previously the head coach at Temple, defensive coordinator at Mississippi State and Florida, and previously worked with Georgia Tech as a graduate assistant and recruiting coordinator. In his first season the Jackets experienced several significant losses. A loss against The Citadel was the Jackets\\' first loss against an FCS opponent since 1983, and a 45–0 loss to Virginia Tech was the Jackets\\' first shutout loss at Bobby Dodd Stadium since 1957.. Geoff Collins was fired from Georgia Tech along with athletic director Todd Stansbury on September 25, 2022 after three 3-win seasons and a 1-3 start in 2022. His final record at Georgia Tech was 10-28, one of the worst coaching records in Georgia Tech history. === Brent Key era (2022-present) === Brent Key, a Georgia Tech alumnus and football letterwinner who at the time was the OL coach, was named the interim for the rest of the 2022 season. Key led the Yellow Jackets to a 4-4 record over the final eight games of the 2022 season. The four wins included two road victories over nationally ranked opponents – a 26-21 win at No. 24 Pitt in his first game at the helm on October 1 and a 21-17 triumph at No. 13 North Carolina on November 19. The Jackets overcame a plethora of injuries (which included its top two quarterbacks.) to finish 5-7 overall and 4-4 in Atlantic Coast Conference play after a 1-3 start. The overall and conference win totals were Tech’s highest since 2018, as was its fourth-place finish in the ACC Coastal Division standings. Key’s Jackets also defeated the three teams that finished ahead of them in the coastal division. (North Carolina, Pitt and Duke). On Tuesday November 29, 2022 the interim tag was stripped and Key was named Georgia Tech’s 21st head football coach. == Conference affiliationsIndependent (1892–1893) == Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (1894–1913) Independent (1914–1915) SIAA (1916–1921) Southern Conference (1922–1932) Southeastern Conference (1933–1963) Independent (1964–1982) Atlantic Coast Conference (1983–present) == Championships == === National championships === Georgia Tech has been named national champion seven times by NCAA-designated major selectors.: 111–114 Georgia Tech claims the 1917, 1928, 1952, and 1990 championships.: 149–150 === Conference championships === Georgia Tech has won 16 conference championships, nine outright and seven shared.

Georgia Tech\\'s first four bowl game appearances, the Rose Bowl (1929), Orange Bowl (1940), Cotton Bowl Classic (1943), and Sugar Bowl (1944), marked the first time a team had competed in all four of the Major Bowl Games. † Interim == Home stadium == The Yellow Jackets play their home games at Bobby Dodd Stadium at Historic Grant Field in Atlanta, Georgia. Upon his hiring in 1904, John Heisman insisted that the Institute acquire its own football field. Grant Field was constructed to appease Heisman as well as bring a true home field advantage to Tech football.From 1893 to 1912, the team used area parks such as Brisbane Park, Ponce de Leon Park, and Piedmont Park as the home field. Georgia Tech took out a seven-year lease on what is now the southern end of Grant Field, although the land was not adequate for sports, due to its unleveled, rocky nature. In 1905, Heisman had 300 convict laborers clear rocks, remove tree stumps, and level out the field for play; Tech students then built a grandstand on the property. The land was purchased by 1913, and John W. Grant donated $15,000 towards the construction of the field\\'s first permanent stands; the field was named Grant Field in honor of the donor\\'s deceased son, Hugh Inman Grant.The stadium now sits amongst a unique urban skyline and is among the oldest Division I FBS football stadiums. In fact, the only Division I stadiums older are Franklin Field at the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard Stadium. Grant Field was natural grass until 1971. The astroturf was replaced by grass in 1995. The stadium officially holds 55,000 but has held up to 56,412 in 2005 and 56,680 in 2006.On February 26, 2019, Georgia Tech officials unveiled plans to hold one home game per season from 2020 to 2024 (five games total) at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, located less than one mile from the Georgia Tech main campus, with the series dubbed \"Mayhem at MBS\". However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, on July 30, 2020, the 2020 game against Notre Dame was moved back to Bobby Dodd Stadium and the agreement with MBS was extended to six years, running through 2026, comprising six games. == Logos and uniforms == The interlocking GT logo was created in 1967 at the request of Bobby Dodd. One of the varsity players was asked to design a logo for the helmets. Several variations of the design were submitted, including a yellow jacket design. The yellow jacket was not submitted because to make the insect look mean it would have to be stinging and therefore flying backwards. The interlocking GT was selected during the summer of 1967 and formalized into decals for the helmets. Over the years it became the official logo for Georgia Tech Athletics.When head coach Paul Johnson was hired in 2008, the Yellow Jackets adopted a new uniform style. One year later, the uniforms were altered to change the yellow to gold. A year after that, the uniforms were altered again. This time, the team adopted separate white uniforms for both home and away games, while retaining the previous styles\\' navy and gold jerseys for occasions when the Yellow Jackets could not wear white at home. In 2018, after nearly 40 years of being with Russell Athletic, Georgia Tech switched to Adidas. With the change came more consistent branding across all sports and a custom shade of gold for the team as well as new uniforms that entwine progressive and traditional elements. The uniforms were updated in 2022 with a more classic look. == Rivalries == === Georgia === Georgia Tech\\'s fight songs and cheers are tailored to belittle the Georgia Bulldogs, and the perennial catch-phrase for Georgia Tech fans for many decades has been \"To Hell with Georgia\". Georgia Tech and the Univ. of Georgia have played each other in football over 100 times (and hundreds more times in basketball, baseball, track and field, tennis, etc.) and this rivalry has become known as Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate. They have been heated rivals since 1893. The annual football game is by far the most important game on the schedule for most Georgia Tech sports fans. The winner of this game takes home the Georgia State Governor\\'s Cup. Georgia Tech trails Georgia in the all-time series 69–41–5 through the 2021 season. === Auburn === The Yellow Jackets have played the Auburn Tigers more than 90 times in football, and the series of football games between the two is the second-oldest in the Southeast. Auburn Univ. or A.P.I. is by far Georgia Tech\\'s second-most-often played opponent in football. The rivalry is also intense in basketball, baseball, etc. The first game took place on November 25, 1892 in Atlanta, Georgia. They played in the SIAA until it was defunct in 1922, before joining the Southeastern Conference. This rivalry lost some luster when the Georgia Tech Athletics discarded its membership in the Southeastern Conference in 1963 to become an independent institute. However, the Yellow Jackets continued their annual series of football games with the Auburn Tigers through 1987. Georgia Tech and Auburn play football games in occasional years, and games in other sports regularly. Even though the Yellow Jackets have joined the Atlantic Coast Conference for all sports in recent decades, from a historical perspective, the Auburn Tigers are Georgia Tech\\'s second-highest sports rivalry, behind only the Georgia Bulldogs. Auburn leads in the all-time series 47–41–4 with the last game played in 2005. === Clemson === The Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets and the Clemson Tigers have the fourth-most-played series in Georgia Tech football history. They have been rivals since 1898 and Clemson is Tech\\'s closest opponent, geographically, in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Also, in the ACC\\'s new two-division arrangement, each team has one football opponent in the opposite division which has been selected as the two teams\\' official cross-division rival that they play every year. The Yellow Jackets and the Clemson Tigers are one of these six pairs. In addition to their geographical closeness and the Heisman connection, the Georgia Tech – Clemson pairing is also a logical one because of both schools\\' long history in engineering, technology, and science education. Recently, the game has become known for last-minute, extremely close finishes. From 1996 to 2001, each of the six games was decided by exactly three points. In 1977 (before the Yellow Jackets had even joined the ACC), this football series was being considered for termination by the administration of Georgia Tech. Clemson football fans, in an effort to show their economic impact on the Atlanta, Ga., area, brought with them to Atlanta large stockpiles of two-dollar bills that were stamped with Clemson Tiger Paws. Georgia Tech leads Clemson in the all-time series 50–32–2 through the 2019 season. === Virginia Tech === The rivalry with Virginia Tech has grown considerably since Virginia Tech entered the ACC. In previous years, the teams played infrequently. The intra-conference game has often seen both teams ranked and the outcome has played a key part in determining the winner of the ACC Coastal Division. Since the ACC switched to Division format in 2005, the winner of this game has gone on to win the Coastal Division all but once, with VT winning six times and GT winning four times. Dubbed the Battle of the Techs, the game has seen some very close, very intense match-ups.Virginia Tech leads the series 11–8 through the 2022 season. === Tennessee === Georgia Tech and Tennessee hadn\\'t met since 1987 until losing a heart breaking Labor Day game in Atlanta in 2017 that renewed the rivalry between the two. When Georgia Tech was part of the Southeastern Conference they played annually. After Georgia Tech left the SEC in 1964, the teams still met until 1987. The series dates back to 1902 and Tennessee leads the series 25–17–2 with the last game played in the 2017 season. === Vanderbilt === The Yellow Jackets and the Vanderbilt Commodores first met in 1892 in Atlanta, Georgia with Vanderbilt winning 20–10. Since 1924, the winning team in the series has received a silver-plated cowbell with the year and final score of each game engraved on it. The trophy was created by Ed F. Cavaleri was described by the Atlanta Constitution as “a faithful Georgia Tech supporter though he did not attend the Jacket institution,” according to Georgia Tech\\'s website. Cavaleri purchased a cowbell at an Atlanta hardware store to use as a noise-maker while on his way to a game in 1924. The Commodores defeated Georgia Tech 3–0, however another fan in attendance suggested that Cavaleri award the bell to the winning team. The tradition was born and Cavaleri attended every game between the two teams from 1924 to 1967. The cowbell has a gold plate screwed into each side, with “GEORGIA TECH-VANDERBILT FOOTBALL TROPHY” inscribed at the top. Three columns list the year of each game, Georgia Tech\\'s points scored and Vanderbilt\\'s points scored. The results of the games from 1924 to 1967 are engraved on one side; the results from 2002, 2003, 2009 and 2016 are on the other. Georgia Tech is 20–15–3 against Vanderbilt in 38 games. The Yellow Jackets won the last matchup 38–7 in 2016. == Significant series == === Notre Dame === This series began in 1922. The Fighting Irish were a longtime rival of the Yellow Jackets and the two teams met periodically on an annual basis over the years, particularly from 1963 to 1981 when both schools were independents following Tech\\'s departure from the Southeastern Conference. The 1975 Georgia Tech-Notre Dame game marked the sole appearance in an Irish uniform of Rudy Ruettiger, the subject of the film Rudy. When Georgia Tech joined the Atlantic Coast Conference beginning in 1982, they were forced to end the series after 1981 because of scheduling difficulties. Consequently, the two teams have met very infrequently since then. Georgia Tech was the opponent in the inaugural game in the newly expanded Notre Dame Stadium in 1997, then a year later they met again in the Gator Bowl. The Fighting Irish and Yellow Jackets met in the 2006 and 2007 season openers and split both games. The rivalry resumed in 2015 with a 30–22 Irish win in South Bend, and will continue on a semi-regular basis as Georgia Tech and Notre Dame are scheduled to face off five times in the next ten years starting in 2020. Notre Dame is set to play Georgia Tech at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in 2020 and 2024. Georgia Tech will travel to South Bend in 2021. Notre Dame leads the series 29–6–1. === Duke === The Blue Devils and the Yellow Jackets have played 88 times in a series that dates back to 1933 and every year since. There was a long period of Duke dominance in the series from 1936 to 1945. The Blue Devils won all but one matchup including a six-game win streak, the longest in the series for Duke. The win streak also came in the glory days for Duke football, as the 1930s and 1940s featured the best Duke football teams. From 1946 to 1984, the series would be rather back and forth, teams exchanging periods of dominance over the other. Heading into the 1984 season, the series was deadlock at 25-25-1. But since then it has been nearly all Georgia Tech. In the 36 matchups since 1984, the Jackets have walked away with 26 victories, the Blue Devils have won just ten. Duke is Georgia Tech\\'s third-most common opponent all-time (behind only Georgia – 113 meetings and Auburn – 92). Georgia Tech leads the series 52–35-1. Georgia Tech won the last matchup 31–27 in 2021. === Alabama === The Crimson Tide and the Yellow Jackets have played 52 times in a rivalry that dates back to 1902. With the exception of a four-year break during World War II (1943–1946), they squared off annually from 1922 to 1963 as members of the Southern Conference (1922–1932) and Southeastern Conference (1933–1963). The rivalry continued for one season after Georgia Tech withdrew from the SEC in 1964, then was renewed again with games in six-straight seasons from 1979 to 1984. With 52 previous meetings, Alabama is Georgia Tech\\'s fifth-most-common all-time opponent (behind only Georgia – 114 meetings, Auburn – 92, Duke – 87 and Clemson – 85). Alabama and Georgia Tech announced in January 2020 that they are set to renew the rivalry after 36 years in 2030 and 2031. Alabama leads the series 28-21-3, and the Yellow Jackets won the last matchup 16–6 in 1984. === Tulane === The Yellow Jackets and the Tulane Green Wave first met on November 4, 1916 in Atlanta, Georgia. Tulane was the opponent at Bobby Dodd Stadium for the Jackets’ first-ever televised football game — a 13–7 win over the Green Wave on WSB-TV on Oct. 2, 1948. Tulane is the seventh-most frequent opponent for Georgia Tech (50 meetings). Tulane and Georgia Tech spent most of their athletic histories as members of the same conference: they were among the first to join the SIAA in 1894 then Georgia Tech left in 1921 and Tulane in 1922 to join the Southern Conference. Both schools moved yet again in 1932 to charter the Southeastern Conference, of which they were members until Tech\\'s departure in 1963 to become independent. Tulane followed suit in 1966, but they played each other yearly until 1982. Georgia Tech is now a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference, while Tulane is a member of the American Athletic Conference. The rivalry was renewed on September 6, 2014, in the first football game played on Tulane\\'s campus since Tulane Stadium was torn down in 1980. Georgia Tech leads the series 37–13. The Yellow Jackets won the last matchup 65–10 in 2015. == Traditions == Colors – Georgia Tech football features old gold and white uniforms with old gold helmets. Navy blue and black have been used as alternate jerseys. In 2006, Georgia Tech featured a throwback jersey based on Bud Carson-era uniforms. The jerseys were mustard gold and the helmets were white. Songs – The fight songs for Georgia Tech are \"Ramblin\\' Wreck from Georgia Tech\" and \"Up With the White and Gold\". If Georgia Tech scores a touchdown, then both songs are played, with Up With the White and Gold being played after the Yellow Jackets score and Ramblin\\' Wreck from Georgia Tech being played after the PAT is kicked. If Georgia Tech only kicks a field goal, \"Ramblin\\' Wreck\" is played. For some big plays, a shortened version of either song is played. Nicknames – Georgia Tech football teams have had several nicknames over the years including the \"Blacksmiths\", the \"Engineers\", the \"Golden Tornado\", or just the \"Techs\". Officially, the teams are called the \"Yellow Jackets\" or the \"Ramblin\\' Wreck\". Mascots – The \"Ramblin\\' Wreck\" and the yellow jacket \"Buzz\" are the mascots of Georgia Tech football. The \"Ramblin\\' Wreck\" is a 1930 Ford Model A Sports Coupe, and it has led the football team on to Grant Field every game since September 30, 1961. \"Buzz\" began pacing the sidelines of Grant Field as a mischievous anthropomorphized yellow jacket during the 1970s. \"Buzz\" was ranked the number three top mascot in all of college football by \"America\\'s Best\" and the \"Top Ten\" Web site. Yellow Jacket Alley – \"Yellow Jacket Alley\" is an event staged before every game. It is a players\\' walk in which the team and coaches walk from the buses to the stadium, and the fans surround and cheer the walking players. Steam Whistle – An industrial steam whistle has been present on Georgia Tech\\'s campus ever since the early industrial shop years. It typically was blown for the change of classes at five minutes before the hour. On football game days, the whistle is blown after every Yellow Jackets\\' score, and again after every Yellow Jackets\\' victory. Student Section – The student sections for the Yellow Jackets\\' home football games are primarily located in the North and South End Zones of Grant Field. Until the 2011 season, Flash Card displays were performed by the student section every football season since 1957. A semi-official student cheering section called the \"Swarm\" is located in the North End Zone adjacent to the marching band. The Swarm began in 1996. RAT Caps - Incoming Georgia Tech freshmen are referred to as RATs, which stands for Recruits At Tech, although in recent years the Student Government has begun incorrectly using Recently Acquired Tech Students. A RAT is encouraged to wear the gold colored beanie caps with the front bill worn turned up and bearing the students name, hometown, major, class year and the letters \"RAT\". A RAT should record the scores of each football game on the sides of their RAT Cap, written right side up for victories, upside down for losses, and sideways for ties. A RAT should write the \"Good Word\" on their caps: \"To HELL with georgia\". It is the responsibility of a RAT to know the fight songs, the Alma Mater, all of the cheers and the \"Good Word\". Before ACC conference regulations prohibited the practice, upperclassmen ordered \"RATs on the field\" before each home game, and RATs would line up in the end zone along both sides of the entry way from the locker room forming an alley way for the Ramblin\\' Wreck to drive through leading the team out onto the field. The ACC forced an end to this tradition after the 1980 season. The RAT cap tradition is most strictly observed by members of the marching band. Marching Band - Even though Georgia Tech is a high-ranking Institute of Technology, and not a college of the arts and humanities, it still fields a 300+ member marching band at all home football games and Bowl Games. A smaller Pep Band attends road games which the full band doesn\\'t attend. Among other songs, the Yellow Jacket Marching Band always plays the Georgia Tech fight songs and the Alma Mater, and in addition, it plays \"When You Say Budweiser, You\\'ve Said It All\" at the completion of the third quarter. == Individual achievements == === Heisman Trophy finalists === Georgia Tech has had several players receive votes in the Heisman Trophy balloting. Eddie Prokop finished fifth in the 1943 Heisman voting, Lenny Snow was fourteenth in 1966, Eddie Lee Ivery was eighth in 1978, and Calvin Johnson was tenth in 2006. Billy Lothridge is the only Tech player to receive votes in multiple years. He was eighth in 1962 and runner-up in 1963. Clint Castleberry was the only freshman in the history of the Heisman to finish as high as third until Herschel Walker\\'s third-place finish in 1980. Castleberry and Walker, however, were both surpassed in 2004 by true freshman Adrian Peterson\\'s Heisman runner-up season. Joe Hamilton tied Lothridge\\'s runner-up status in 1999. === All-Americans === Georgia Tech has fielded 50 First Team All-Americans. The first All-Americans at Tech were Walker Carpenter and Everett Strupper in 1917 while the most recent were Durant Brooks in 2007, Michael Johnson in 2008, Derrick Morgan in 2009, and Shaquille Mason in 2014. === Position award winners === Four Georgia Tech players have been awarded the highest collegiate award possible for their position. Joe Hamilton won the Davey O\\'Brien Award after his senior season in 1999, Calvin Johnson won the Fred Biletnikoff Award after his junior season in 2006, and Durant Brooks and Pressley Harvin III won the Ray Guy Award in 2007 and 2020 respectively. Hamilton and Johnson were the only Tech players to be named ACC Player of the Year until Jonathan Dwyer received the honor in 2008. === Post-collegiate accolades === ==== College Football Hall of Fame ==== Georgia Tech has had three coaches and 14 players inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame just down the street in Atlanta. Coaches Heisman, Alexander, and Dodd were inducted in the 1954, 1951, and 1993 classes respectively. ==== NFL Draft ==== Georgia Tech has over 150 alumni that have played in the National Football League. Tech has had ten players selected in the first round of the NFL draft since its inception in 1937. The first Georgia Tech player ever to be drafted was Middleton Fitzsimmons in 1937. He was drafted 2nd in the 10th round by the Chicago Bears. The first Tech player selected in the first round was Eddie Prokop in 1945 and the most recent first round Yellow Jackets were Demaryius Thomas and Derrick Morgan in 2010. First round draft picks ==== Pro Football Hall of Fame ==== Three Yellow Jackets have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Joe Guyon played professional football from 1920 to 1927. Guyon was a collegiate teammate of Jim Thorpe at Carlisle Indian Industrial School before transferring to Georgia Tech. His playing career began with the Canton Bulldogs and finished with the New York Giants. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in the class of 1966. Billy Shaw played professional football for the Buffalo Bills from 1961 to 1969. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in the class of 1999. Calvin Johnson played for the Detroit Lions from 2007 to 2015. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in the class of 2021, his first year of eligibility. == Future opponents == Announced schedules as of February 4, 2021. As a member of the ACC Coastal Division, Georgia Tech plays two games against a team from the ACC Atlantic Division every year. Clemson is their permanent cross-divisional rival and is played every year, while the other team rotates among the other six Atlantic teams. == Notes == == References == == Bibliography == McMath, Robert C.; Bayor, Ronald H.; Brittain, James E.; Foster, Lawrence; Giebelhaus, August W.; Reed, Germaine M.

Appeals from the court are taken to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit at Cincinnati (except for patent claims and claims against the U.S. government under the Tucker Act, which are appealed to the Federal Circuit). The United States Attorney's Office of the Southern District of Ohio represents the United States in civil and criminal litigation in the court. As of November 2021, the United States Attorney is Kenneth L.

Cases from the counties of Champaign, Clark, Darke, Greene, Miami, Montgomery, Preble, and Shelby are heard at Dayton. == History == The United States District Court for the District of Ohio was established on February 19, 1803, by 2 Stat. 201. The act of authorized one judgeship for the court. The district court in Ohio, not being assigned to a judicial circuit, was granted the same jurisdiction as U.S. circuit courts, except in appeals and writs of error, which were the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. By the act of February 24, 1807, 2 Stat. 420, the authority of the Ohio district court to exercise the jurisdiction of a U.S. circuit court was repealed, and Ohio was assigned to the newly organized Seventh Circuit. It also provided for a U.S. circuit court for the District of Ohio. The District was subdivided into Northern and Southern Districts on February 10, 1855, by 10 Stat. 604. The district judge serving the District of Ohio, Humphrey H. Leavitt, was reassigned to the Southern District of Ohio. On July 23, 1866, by 14 Stat. 209, Congress reorganized the circuits and assigned Ohio to the Sixth Circuit. Additional judgeships were created in 1910, 1937, 1966, 1970, 1978, 1984, and 1990. == Current judges == As of December 16, 2022: == Former judges == == Chief judges == Chief judges have administrative responsibilities with respect to their district court. Unlike the Supreme Court, where one justice is specifically nominated to be chief, the office of chief judge rotates among the district court judges. To be chief, a judge must have been in active service on the court for at least one year, be under the age of 65, and have not previously served as chief judge. A vacancy is filled by the judge highest in seniority among the group of qualified judges. The chief judge serves for a term of seven years or until age 70, whichever occurs first. The age restrictions are waived if no members of the court would otherwise be qualified for the position. When the office was created in 1948, the chief judge was the longest-serving judge who had not elected to retire on what has since 1958 been known as senior status or declined to serve as chief judge. After August 6, 1959, judges could not become or remain chief after turning 70 years old.

              " 'ʼuʼ ([ʔuʔ], beginning and ending with a glottal stop) is the first opera in the Klingon language, billed as \"The first authentic Klingon opera on Earth\". It was composed by Eef van Breen to a libretto by Kees Ligtelijn and Marc Okrand under the artistic direction of Floris Schönfeld. The story of ʼuʼ is based on the epic legend of \"Kahless the Unforgettable\", a messianic figure in the history of the fictional Klingon species. The premiere of the opera in The Hague on 10 September 2010 was a success, and the opera has been revived since then. == Background == The Klingon language was first conceived by actor James Doohan, who played Montgomery Scott (\"Scotty\") in the original Star Trek television series, for Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979). He created some harsh-sounding words to be spoken by Klingon characters. The producers hired linguist Marc Okrand for the sequels to expand this into a full-fledged language with its own unique vocabulary, grammar, and idioms. Okrand designed the language to sound \"alien\", using a number of typologically uncommon features. As Klingon characters became more important in later Star Trek films and television series, Okrand continued to expand the language, and it has become a spoken language with a number of fluent speakers. As depicted in Star Trek, the Klingons are passionate opera lovers. According to the official webpage for the opera, \"Klingon opera uses the principle of musical combat. Beauty in Klingon music comes from the impact of two opposing forces.\" ʼuʼ is translated to English as \"universe\" or \"universal\".The opera was workshopped beginning 2008 in Europe and at the Watermill Center for the Performing Arts in Water Mill, New York. Artistic and stage director and \"head researcher\" of the ʼuʼ project and the Klingon Terran Research Ensemble (KTRE), Floris Schönfeld, carefully researched all mentions and examples of Klingon opera in the various incarnations of Star Trek in order to make the opera as \"authentic\" as possible in following the conventions of Klingon battle opera. He created an \"ancient treatise\" called the paqʼjachchuʼ, or \"book of the perfect scream\", as a \"theory manuscript of Klingon music\". KTRE crafted \"indigenous\" Klingon musical instruments, including percussion, wind and strings, designed by Xavier van Wersch, to accompany the opera.Publicity for ʼuʼ included lectures and performances by Schönfeld and KTRE at SF conventions and elsewhere. On 18 April 2010, Okrand, on behalf of the KTRE, broadcast a message from the CAMRAS radio telescope to the hypothetical co-ordinates of QoʼnoS, the Klingon home planet, in the Arcturus solar system. The message, in the Klingon language, invited the Klingons to attend the opera, although the message presumably did not reach the planet in time for the performance, since QoʼnoS is 36 light years from Earth. == Productions and reaction == The opera had its official debut at the Zeebelt Theater in The Hague, Netherlands, on 10 September 2010 (following a preview the day before) for a four-performance limited run. The Dutch artist Henri van Zanten narrated the opera as the Master of the Scream. The opera was produced by Zeebelt and KTRE, which is associated with the ArtScience department of the Royal Conservatory in The Hague.Audience reaction after the preview was enthusiastic, and the opening night, which was attended by Marc Okrand, sold out. The director of the Byrd Hoffman Watermill Foundation commented, \"I found the result quite fascinating and interesting and strange and weird.\" The opera was repeated later in September 2010 at the Star Trek fanclub meeting Qetlop in Farnsberg, near Bad Brückenau, Germany, \"for an all-Klingon audience\". It was performed again on 23 and 24 November at the Frascati Theater in Amsterdam. In 2011 the opera was performed at the Voi-Z opera festival in Zwolle on 5 April and at the Huygens Music Festival in Leidschendam on 28 May.Performances of ʼuʼ were held in the Zeebelt Theatre in The Hague on 17 February 2012 and in Rijeka, Croatia, on 25 February 2012. The opera was performed in Berlin on 22 February 2013. == Synopsis == === Act 1 – yav === While hunting with his brother Morath, Kahless expresses anger when Morath causes him to miss his prey. Kahless vows to avenge this humiliation. The tyrant Molor offers to elevate Morath to the head of his house if he betrays his and Kahless\\'s father. Morath accepts. With Molor\\'s men, Morath enters his father\\'s house, seizes his sword and demands that his father surrender the house. When his father refuses, Morath brutally slays his father. Kahless vows to restore their father\\'s honor. He pursues Morath to the Kri\\'stak volcano. After the brothers fight, Morath throws himself into the volcano. Kahless forges the first bat\\'leth (or \"Sword of Honor\") in the volcano, from his own hair. === Act 2 – raD === The sorrowful Kahless makes an epic journey to the underworld. There he is united with his father and forgives his brother. He shows them the mok\\'bara, enabling them to regain their bodies. Kortar, the guardian of the underworld, is enraged to find two of his souls missing. Kahless raises troops for a rebellion against Molor. He meets his true love, the Lady Lukara, who assists him when he is attacked by Molor\\'s men. Together, they defeat Molor\\'s men and make violent love in the blood of their enemies. === Act 3 – QIH === At the river, the armies have assembled. Kahless inspires his troops with a rousing speech. Kortar arrives and is also stirred by Kahless\\'s honorable motives. He agrees to join the fight and to create a heaven for the Klingon warriors. Kahless, his father and brother fight together against their enemies. The latter two are honorably killed, and Kahless\\'s death scream sends them to heaven. Kahless faces Molor and kills him, cuts out his heart and cleans it in the river to restore Molor\\'s honor. With the Lady Lukara\\'s help, Kahless commits ritual suicide; Lukara\\'s death scream sends him to join his father and brother. The Klingon people are united. == Roles and original cast == Master of the Scream (narrator) – Henri van Zanten Kahless (contralto) – Taru Huotari Kotar, Father and Molor (baritone) – Ben Kropp Morath and Lukara (mezzo-soprano) – Jeannette Huizinga == References == == External links == General linksOfficial website KTRE\\'s website Photo of Klingon instruments used to accompany the opera Interview with ʼuʼ creator linking opera\\'s debut with lessons of 9/11 Feature on the opera from the Rachel Maddow ShowVideos related to the operaScene from the opening night performance on YouTube, September 2010 Snippets of the opera and interviews, September 2010, BBC News \"Recreating the primal sound of Klingon opera\" on YouTube, July 2008 Klingon broadcast to Qoʼnos: Invitation to attend the opera on YouTube, April 2010',\n",

              " 'Cîteaux Abbey (French: Abbaye de Cîteaux [abe.i d(ə) sito]) is a Catholic abbey located in Saint-Nicolas-lès-Cîteaux, south of Dijon, France. It is notable for being the original house of the Cistercian order. Today, it belongs to the Trappists (also called the Cistercians of the Strict Observance). The abbey has about 35 members. The monks produce a cheese branded under the abbey\\'s name, as well as caramels and honey-based candies. == History == Cîteaux Abbey was founded on Saint Benedict\\'s Day, 21 March 1098, by a group of monks from Molesme Abbey seeking to follow more closely the Rule of St. Benedict. The Abbey was supported by Renaud, Vicomte de Beaune, and Odo I, Duke of Burgundy. They were led by Saint Robert of Molesme, who became the first abbot. The site was wooded and swampy, in a sparsely populated area. The toponym predates the abbey, but its origin is uncertain. Theories include a derivation from cis tertium [lapidem miliarium], \"this side of the third [milestone]\" of the Roman road connecting Langres and Chalons sur Saône, or alternatively from cisternae \"cisterns\", which in Middle Latin could refer to stagnant pools of a swamp.The monastery produced the illuminated manuscript now known as the Cîteaux Moralia in Job in the year 1111.The second abbot was Saint Alberic, and the third abbot Saint Stephen Harding, who wrote the Carta Caritatis that described the organisation of the order. Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, who would later be proclaimed Doctor of the Church, was a monk of Cîteaux Abbey and left it in 1115 to found Clairvaux Abbey, of which he was the first abbot. Saint Bernard would also be influential in the subsequent rapid growth of the Cistercian order. The great church of Cîteaux Abbey, begun in around 1140, was completed in 1193. The Dukes of Burgundy subsequently used it as their dynastic place of burial. By the beginning of the 13th century the order had more than 500 houses. Cîteaux was then an important center of Christianity. In 1244, King Louis IX of France (Saint Louis) and his mother Blanche of Castile visited the abbey. During the Hundred Years\\' War, the monastery was pillaged in 1360 (when the monks sought refuge in Dijon), 1365, 1434 and 1438. In 1380, the Earl of Buckingham stayed at L\\'Aumône Abbey, a daughter house of Cîteaux located in the forest of Marchenoir whilst his army was quartered in the surrounding Forest.In the beginning of the 16th century, the abbey was a strong community of about 200 members. The abbey was badly hit by the French Wars of Religion. The abbey then slowly declined for the next century. In 1698, the abbey only had 72 professed monks. In 1791, during the French Revolution, the abbey was seized and sold by the government. In 1898, the remains of the abbey were bought back and repopulated by Trappists. == List of abbots == == References == == Sources == Plouvier, M. and Saint-Denis, A.

The winner is voted on by 30 members of the Baseball Writers\\' Association of America (BBWAA). Each submits a vote for first, second, and third place among the managers of each league. The manager with the highest score in each league wins the award.Several managers have won the award in a season in which they led their team to 100 or more wins. They are: Lou Piniella – 116 (Seattle Mariners, 2001) Joe Torre – 114 (New York Yankees, 1998) Gabe Kapler – 107 (San Francisco Giants, 2021) Sparky Anderson – 104 (Detroit Tigers, 1984) Tony La Russa – 104 (Oakland Athletics, 1988) Dusty Baker – 103 (San Francisco Giants, 1993) Larry Dierker – 102 (Houston Astros, 1998) Whitey Herzog – 101 (St. Louis Cardinals, 1985) Rocco Baldelli – 101 (Minnesota Twins, 2019) Buck Showalter – 101 (New York Mets, 2022) Kevin Cash – 100 (Tampa Bay Rays, 2021)In 1991, Bobby Cox became the first manager to win the award in both leagues, winning with the Atlanta Braves and having previously won with the Toronto Blue Jays in 1985. La Russa, Piniella, Showalter, Jim Leyland, Bob Melvin, Davey Johnson, and Joe Maddon have since won the award in both leagues. Cox, La Russa, and Showalter have won the most awards, with four. Baker, Leyland, Piniella, Maddon, Melvin, and Terry Francona have won three times. In 2005, Cox became the first manager to win the award in consecutive years. Cash became the second manager in 2021, and first in the AL, to win the award in consecutive years. Terry Francona and Buck Showalter are the most recent winners. Because of the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike cut the season short and canceled the post-season, the BBWAA writers effectively created a de facto mythical national championship (similar to college football) by naming managers of the unofficial league champions (lead the leagues in winning percentage) (Buck Showalter and Felipe Alou) as Managers of the Year. The Chicago White Sox have seen five managers win the award, most in the majors, while one franchise, the Milwaukee Brewers, has not had a manager win the award. Only five managers have won the award while leading a team that finished outside the top two spots in its division. Buck Rodgers was the first, winning the award in 1987 with the third-place Expos. Tony Peña and Showalter won the award with third-place teams in back-to-back years: Peña with the Royals in 2003, and Showalter with the Rangers in 2004. Joe Girardi is the only manager to win the award with a fourth-place team (2006 Florida Marlins); he is also the only manager to win the award after fielding a team with a losing record. == Key == == Winners == === American League === === National League === == Notes == a The formula used to calculate the final scores is Score = 5F + 3S + T, where F is the number of first-place votes, S is second -place votes, and T is third-place votes. b The 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike ended the season on August 11, as well as cancelling the entire postseason, with writers effectively turning the vote into a de facto mythical national championship, similar to college football. c Johnny Oates and Joe Torre tied for the lead among voters in the American League in 1996. d Teams played a truncated 60-game season in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. == See also == \"Esurance MLB Awards\" Best Manager (in MLB) Baseball America Manager of the Year Baseball Prospectus Internet Baseball Awards Manager of the Year Chuck Tanner Major League Baseball Manager of the Year Award Associated Press Manager of the Year (discontinued in 2001) Honor Rolls of Baseball #Managers MLB All-Time Manager (1997; BBWAA) Sporting News Manager of the Decade (2009) Sports Illustrated MLB Manager of the Decade (2009) Major League Baseball all-time managerial wins Best Coach/Manager ESPY Award (all sports) == References == General\"Manager of the Year Award Winners\".

She began skating during her second year of elementary school, after watching Mao Asada\\'s figure skating performances on TV. Mihara graduated from Ashiya High School in 2018, then obtained an undergraduate degree at Konan University in 2022.Mihara suffers from juvenile idiopathic arthritis, skating despite the disease. In 2017, she signed an affiliation agreement with Sysmex, a Japanese company involved with healthcare and the promotion of healthy lifestyles. She has donated her hair three times as of 2022 towards the creation of wigs for individuals who have lost hair due to accidents or medical conditions such as alopecia.After becoming the Four Continents champion in 2017 while skating to Cinderella, she earned the nickname \"Cinderella on Ice\". == Career == === Early years === Mihara began skating in 2007. In the 2012–13 season, she won the bronze medal in the Novice A category at the Japanese Novice Championships and placed 8th at the Japan Junior Championships. === 2013–2014 season === During the 2013–14 season, Mihara debuted on the ISU Junior Grand Prix (JGP) circuit, placing fifth in Minsk, Belarus. After winning the Japanese national silver medal on the junior level, she finished her season by placing twelfth on the senior level at the Japan Championships. === 2014–2015 season === Mihara started her season by placing sixth at her JGP event in Ljubljana, Slovenia. She then placed seventh at the Japan Junior Championships and ninth at the Japan Championships. === 2015–2016 season === Mihara made her senior international debut in early August 2015, winning the Asian Open ahead of Riona Kato. She was awarded silver medals at her JGP events in Bratislava, Slovakia and Linz, Austria, and qualified for the 2015–16 JGP Final in Barcelona.Mihara placed eighth at the 2015–16 Japanese Junior Championships and sixth at the JGP Final. She was diagnosed with arthritis in December, following the JGP Final. === 2016–2017 season: Four Continents champion === In September, Mihara competed at her first Challenger Series competition, the 2016 CS Nebelhorn Trophy. Ranked second in the short program and first in the free skate, she won the gold medal ahead of Russia\\'s Elizaveta Tuktamysheva. Her Grand Prix debut came the following month at the 2016 Skate America. She was awarded the bronze medal, behind American skaters Ashley Wagner and Mariah Bell, after placing second in the short and third in the free. She finished fourth at her next Grand Prix assignment, the 2016 Cup of China. In December 2016, Mihara took bronze at the Japan Championships, ranking fifth in the short and second in the free. In February 2017, she placed fourth in the short and first in the free at the Four Continents Championships in Gangneung, South Korea, outscoring Canada\\'s Gabrielle Daleman by 3.94 points for the gold medal.In March 2017, Mihara competed at the 2017 World Championships in Helsinki, Finland. Ranked fifteenth in the short program after doubling and falling on a planned triple flip, Mihara ranked fourth in the free skate and climbed to fifth overall. In April, she competed as part of Team Japan at the 2017 World Team Trophy. She achieved a personal best of 72.10 points in the short program and scored a Japanese national record of 146.17 points in the free skate. She finished second behind Medvedeva and 0.83 ahead of compatriot Wakaba Higuchi while Team Japan won the gold medal. === 2017–2018 season: Four Continents silver === Mihara won silver at the 2017 CS Autumn Classic International. She placed fourth at both of her Grand Prix assignments, 2017 Cup of China and 2017 Internationaux de France.After a fifth-place finish at the 2017-18 Japan Figure Skating Championships she was assigned to the 2018 Four Continents Championships. At the championships, she was third in the short program behind countrywomen Satoko Miyahara and Kaori Sakamoto. After a second-place finish in the free skate and mistakes from Miyahara, Mihara rose to second place overall. === 2018–2019 season: Winter Universiade champion === Mihara won silver at the 2018 CS Nebelhorn Trophy. In the Grand Prix, she first competed at the 2018 NHK Trophy, the most hotly-contested ladies\\' event on the Grand Prix that year. She was third in the short program but dropped to fourth in the free skate and overall despite making only one error, a jump under rotation. She then narrowly placed second at the 2018 Internationaux de France, slightly behind compatriot Rika Kihira. Mihara said she was unsatisfied with her free skate in France but that \"overall, it was a good experience for me, and I will continue to practice to gain more confidence.\"At the 2018 Japan Championships, Mihara placed third in both programs, finishing fourth overall. She was again assigned to the Japanese team for the Four Continents Championships. Competing at Four Continents, she underrotated her opening combination jump to place eighth in the short program. She described this as an error she would not normally make, even in practice. Mihara then placed second in the free skate, winning the bronze medal overall, her third consecutive Four Continents podium finish. Mihara concluded her season at the 2019 Winter Universiade, where she won the ladies singles\\' title. === 2019–2020 season: Hiatus === Poor health forced Mihara to withdraw from both of her Grand Prix assignments, the 2019 Skate Canada International and 2019 Cup of China. She would not compete for the remainder of the season. Her longtime training mate and friend Kaori Sakamoto would subsequently feel that Mihara\\'s absence from the rink contributed to Sakamoto\\'s lackluster results. === 2020–2021 season: Return to competition === Mihara returned to competition domestically, winning the bronze medal at the Kinki Regional Championships and then silver at the Western Sectionals. With the COVID-19 pandemic affecting international travel, the ISU designed the Grand Prix primarily based on geographic location, and Mihara was one of eleven Japanese skaters assigned to the 2020 NHK Trophy alongside South Korean You Young. She placed seventh in the short program. Mihara was third in the free skate, rising to fourth place overall, slightly more than four points behind bronze medalist Rino Matsuike. Addressing her return to competition post-illness, she said, \"the crowd welcomed me back, and I can\\'t thank them enough.\"Competing at the 2020–21 Japan Championships, Mihara was third in the short program with a clean skate. In the free skate, she doubled a planned triple Lutz and ranked seventh in that segment, dropping to fifth place overall. === 2021–2022 season: Four Continents champion === Beginning the season at the Olympic test event, the 2021 CS Asian Open Trophy, Mihara won the gold medal. She was initially assigned to only one Grand Prix event, the 2021 Cup of China, which was subsequently replaced by the 2021 Gran Premio d\\'Italia. Upon Rika Kihira\\'s withdrawal from the 2021 Skate Canada International due to ankle injury, Mihara was named to replace her. Mihara was seventh in the short program at Skate Canada International despite a clean skate but rose to fourth overall with a third-place free skate. She finished 4.53 points behind bronze medalist Alena Kostornaia, with new personal bests in the free skate and total score. Competing in Italy the following week, she again placed fourth, setting new personal bests in the free skate and total score. Speaking afterward, Mihara said she hoped to regain more power and speed.At the 2021–22 Japan Championships, the final national qualification event for the 2022 Winter Olympics, Mihara placed fifth in the short program. She was fifth as well in the free skate segment, making a notable error by performing only a single Axel instead of a planned double in combination with a triple toe loop. She finished fourth overall, less than four points behind bronze medalist Mana Kawabe. She was named as an alternate for the Japanese Olympic team and assigned to compete at the 2022 Four Continents Championships. Mihara won both segments of the competition to take her second Four Continents gold, as well as a fourth medal at the event overall. She reflected on her comeback to the sport, saying, \"I was well supported, surrounded by very warm people, and it showed me how lucky I am. I was happy to come back.\" === 2022–2023 season: Grand Prix Final champion === Mihara began the season on the Grand Prix at the 2022 MK John Wilson Trophy in Sheffield. Despite an error on the triple flip, she won the short program, finishing 0.17 points ahead of American skater Isabeau Levito. She won the free program by a wider margin after a clean skate, taking her first Grand Prix gold medal. Mihara reflected that her win at the event was \"maybe the biggest happiness it gave to me\". Her second assignment, the 2022 Grand Prix of Espoo, was widely regarded as a contest between her and Belgium\\'s Loena Hendrickx, the reigning World silver medalist who had earlier won the 2022 Grand Prix de France. Mihara placed second in the short program, 1.30 points behind Hendrickx. Both she and Hendrickx made errors in the free skate segment, but Mihara took first overall, earning her second gold medal and qualifying to the Grand Prix Final for the first time in her career. She cited \"a lot of regrets\" about the free skate but said she was \"happy to go to the Grand Prix Final.\"With the Final being held in Turin, Mihara was able to train with longtime friend and fellow qualifier Kaori Sakamoto in the leadup, having not been able to train together for \"such a long time.\" Mihara said she found it \"very gratifying.\" She finished second in the short program, 1.28 points behind Sakamoto and only 0.34 points ahead of third-place Hendrickx. Her score was a new personal best in the segment of 74.58. Mihara went on to finish first in what the ISU itself characterized as a \"turbulent\" free skate segment, despite underrotating one jump and falling out of another, while frontrunner Sakamoto dropped off the podium entirely. Mihara called the result \"unbelievable.\" The Olympic Channel concluded, \"Mihara Mai is having the season of her dreams.\"Following her victory at the Final, Mihara entered the 2022–23 Japan Championships as a title contender. She finished second in the short program with a 74.70 score, 3.09 points behind Sakamoto, after the second part of her jump combination was called underrotated. She was second in the free skate as well, albeit 10.03 points behind Sakamoto, winning the silver medal and standing on the Japanese national podium for the first time in six years.Competing at her second Winter World University Games (formerly Universiade), this time held in Lake Placid, Mihara finished second in the short program behind Sakamoto. She won the free skate, taking the gold medal for a second time. She was on the third woman to win the event twice, after Miwa Fukuhara and Tonia Kwiatkowski. Mihara next appeared at the International Challenge Cup at the end of February, winning the silver medal. Sakamoto and Mana Kawabe joined her on the podium in a Japanese sweep of the medals. She noted that she had missed some training recently as a result of influenza. == Programs == == Competitive highlights == GP: Grand Prix; CS: Challenger Series; JGP: Junior Grand Prix == Detailed results == === Senior level === Small medals for short and free programs awarded only at ISU Championships.

              " \"The packer's knot is a binding knot which is easily pulled taut and quickly locked in position. It is most often made in small line or string, such as that used for hand baling, parcel tying, and binding roasts. This latter use, and its general form, make it a member of a class of similar knots known as butcher's knots. == Tying and variations == A lightly tightened figure-eight knot is formed around the standing part of the line such that both ends emerge from the same point. Pulling on the standing part tightens the binding. After the desired degree of tension is reached, a locking half-hitch is added over the working end and pulled taut. Even without the locking half-hitch the knot will generally maintain tension while additional tying is accomplished, such as putting a second, perpendicular, wrap on a package.A similar knot made with an overhand knot instead of a figure-eight works almost as well. Many other variations also exist finishing with this style of locking half-hitch. In fact, Clifford Ashley claimed that there were more knots of this type to be found than any other used for a single purpose. == See also == Corned beef knot List of binding knots List of knots == References == == External links == Diagram of a packer's knot\",\n",

              " 'An impromptu (, French: [ɛ̃pʁɔ̃pty], loosely meaning \"offhand\") is a free-form musical composition with the character of an ex tempore improvisation as if prompted by the spirit of the moment, usually for a solo instrument, such as piano. According to Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung, Johann Baptist Cramer began publishing piano pieces under the (sub-)title of \"impromptu.\" (AMZ, Mar. No II, 1815, col. 6), which seems to be the first recorded use of the term impromptu in this sense. == Form usage == Since the very concept of unpremeditated, spur-of-the-moment inspiration without studied care is at the heart of Romantic artistic theory, it did not take long before the first generation of Romantic composers took up the idea. Others were: Frédéric Chopin composed 4 Impromptus, including the famous Fantaisie-Impromptu. Jan Václav Voříšek was the first one to compose impromptus published under that title, in 1822. Franz Schubert published two sets of four Impromptus for piano op. 90 and 142 (1827). After his death 3 more unnamed piano compositions (Klavierstücke) were sometimes named Impromptus. Robert Schumann wrote some Impromptus, published as Op. 5. Franz Liszt composed an Impromptu in F sharp (sometimes called Nocturne) and a piano piece named Valse-Impromptu. Alexander Scriabin is known to have written at least nine impromptus for the piano in his early period. Jean Sibelius composed six impromptus for piano op. 5 (1893)The impromptu genre remained popular all throughout the 19th century and was prominent throughout the romantic era. In the 20th century, there are also several examples of composers naming their compositions \"Impromptu\", such as: Gabriel Fauré composing six Impromptus between 1881 and 1913. Richard Rodney Bennett composing five Impromptus for guitar in 1968 Maurice Journeau composing six Impromptus between 1971 and 1974. Donald Martino composing Fantasies and Impromptu in 1980. Nikolai Kapustin composing four Impromptus between 1991 and 1997. Lowell Liebermann composing Three Impromptus Op.68 in 2000 and Two Impromptus Op.131 in 2016. Vince Mendoza\\'s Epiphany, performed by the London Symphony Orchestra and published in 1999. The first piece of the album is named Impromptu. One of Queen\\'s songs, performed at Wembley Stadium and other performances is named Impromptu. == References ==',\n",

It utilizes a three lifting surface design consisting of a forward wing (foreplane), main wing (mainplane) and horizontal stabilizer (tailplane). The aircraft was designed and originally built by Eagle Aircraft Pty Ltd, but is now manufactured in Malaysia by Composites Technology Research Malaysia (CTRM). == Design and development == The Eagle 150B is a development of the Eagle X-TS from Western Australian inventors Neil Graham and his father Deryck Graham. Australian aeronautical engineer Graham Swannell and American aerodynamicist John Roncz were then engaged to design an aircraft to meet then-current JAR VLA requirements and demonstrate minimal stall characteristics. The resulting prototype (designated Eagle 150A) was first flown in March 1988, and was certified in November 1996. The aircraft demonstrated docile stall characteristics, rapid roll rates, 125 knot cruise speed (at 75% power) and crisp handling. After 15 aircraft were built at Fremantle, Western Australia, the Eagle 150B was introduced. Roncz was presented with the Prince's Australian Medal for the design of the Eagle 150 by His Royal Highness Prince Philip at a London ceremony in 2000.The manufacturing rights to the Eagle 150B are now owned by the Malaysian company Composites Technology Research Malaysia (CTRM). == Eagle Airborne Reconnaissance Vehicle == A development of the aircraft as an unmanned aerial vehicle has been designated the Eagle ARV System. The first system, consisting of three aircraft and a ground station, has been purchased by the Malaysian government and other 20 on order.

On stage, he usually wears a pink vest and white pants. Aside from comedy, he is also known for his participation in sporting events such as kickboxing, bodybuilding, and finswimming. He was also a YouTuber under the name Hideo Furui. == Biography == 1979 - Born in Tokorozawa, Saitama 1991 - Graduated from Meiho Elementary School, Tokorozawa, Saitama 1993 - Met Wakabayashi as a classmate 1994 - Graduated from Nihon University Dai-ni Junior High School in Tokyo 1997 - Graduated from Nihon University Dai-ni High School in Tokyo 1997 - Entered Nihon University majoring in commerce in Tokyo 2000 - Formed owari duo \"Nice Middle\" with Wakabayashi 2000 - Took a year off from Nihon University 2001 - Returned to Nihon University 2002 - Graduated from Nihon University 2005 - Changed the duo\\'s name to \"Audrey\", taken from Audrey Hepburn 2007 - Defeated by Wang HongXiang at K-1 Tryout 2008 - Won 2nd place at Autobacs M-1 Grand Prix 2008 2009 - Won 1st place at Shinshun Owarai Taisho - New wave awards (won 76,009 votes out of total 212,036 from TV audiences) == Early life == Kasuga learned swimming from his early childhood through his junior high school years. He attended a private junior high school in Tokyo, Nihon University Dai-ni Junior High, and met Wakabayashi there when they were 8th graders. Wakabayashi, a trouble-making kid sitting just behind Kasuga, played with him, sneakily cutting his hair from behind without telling him. In spite of Wakabayashi\\'s misbehavior, Kasusga\\'s first impression on Wakabayashi was that he was a \"cute boy\", and they got along. They also attended the same high school, Nihon University Dai-ni High School and joined the American Football Club. Kasuga was chosen as a member of the Kanto\\'s all-star American Football Team as a defensive end. However, a penny-pincher, Kasuga did not want to buy outdoor shoes for astro turf that players were suggested to wear for the all-star game, and improperly wearing indoor shoes, was replaced soon after the game had started.After his high school years, Wakabayashi invited Kasuga to be his manzai partner. However, Kasuga decided to attend Nihon University instead. He spent his university years by taking part-time jobs such as a sales clerk position at Seibu Dome. He mentioned that one day a Glay concert was held there while he was working, and he was very moved after ten years when he was invited to Glay vocalist Teru\\'s birthday party as his favorite aspiring comedian.Attending mass communication seminars, Kasuga initially planned to be a TV producer while Wakabayashi kept inviting Kasuga to start a comedy career. Finally Kasuga accepted his offer, and they formed a comedy duo, \"Nice Middle\", in 2000. == Career == === Dark days to M-1 Grand Prix 2008 === Although they happily jumped into a comedy career, they stayed unsuccessful for several years. One day, six years since their debut, a TV play writer called Wakabayashi in person and told him \"Kasuga has no talent as a tsukkomi. If you want to play a boke, you\\'d better look for another partner.\" Wakabayashi, then the boke of the duo, relayed the comment to the then tsukkomi Kasuga, but he initially thought Wakabashi was just joking around and did not believe him at all. They eventually swapped their roles, went through a trial-and-error process, and finally they made the first appearance on terrestrial TV on New Year\\'s Day of 2008. On December 21, 2008, the two made it all the way into the final round of the M-1 Grand Prix of the year from the consolation match. During the first session in the final, they were temporarily in the top position above the other eight duos, but eventually ended up 2nd behind Non Style. === Rise to popularity === Shaving his sideburns (a hair style called a \"techno-cut\"), wearing his hair parted \"80/20\" (80% of the hair is combed to the right and the rest to the left) and a pink sweater vest, Kasuga, a unique arrogant character, has been broadly accepted by audiences since the M-1 Grand Prix. In October 2009, Kasuga was chosen with Wakabayashi as a new regular member for \"Waratte Iitomo\", the nation\\'s most popular afternoon TV show, and a radio personality for \"All Night Nippon\", one of the longest-running radio programs in Japan. === Character on stage === Kasuga walks heavily and slowly with his proud 101 cm chest expanding toward the center of the stage. At the opening, he drops a bossy comment to female audiences such as \"Would you like to deliver Kasuga\\'s baby?\" In manzai, he tries to shoot tsukkomi and each time it turns out to be terribly off-the-line boke. Also, he interrupts Wakabayashi\\'s talks with delayed responses and frequent gags. In manzai and talk, he responds back saying \"Oui\" (\"Yes\"). Holding up his index finger, he yells \"Toos!\" meaning \"Hey!\" or \"I did it!\" Some of his other recurring gags include \"Onigawara\", \"Apa\" and the \"Kasu\" dance. === Penny pincher === His stingy life style has been introduced in many variety shows. He says that he wants to save as much money as possible to buy a single-family home in the future. === Other ventures === Kasuga participated in K-1 kickboxing in 2007. He retired after two fighting matches due to ruptured eardrum.Kasuga has represented Japan at the Finswimming Master World Cup, organized by the Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques. He won a bronze medal at the 2015 event in Ravenna, Italy and a silver medal at the 2016 event in Prague, Czech Republic.Kasuga started bodybuilding in 2013 and placed fifth at the 23rd Tokyo Bodybuilding Tournament in 2015. He did not qualify at the 24th event in 2016.Kasuga ran a YouTube channel under the name Hideo Furui, which was discontinued in December 2021. == Personal life == He is described as reserved, polite and modest, contrary to his character on TV. Wakabayashi has said he has never heard Kasuga speaking bad about others. Mikio Date, a member of owarai duo Sandwichman has also said Kasuga had neither spoken ill of others nor agreed with other comedians\\' bad comments on others at their joint live rehearsals.His father has been very supportive of his career, making original DVDs of Kasuga to distribute to the family\\'s neighbors, and frequently giving him advice by e-mail. Though initially against his comedy career, his mother is also supportive, distributing to neighbors the Playboy magazine when one of the issues carried an article on Kasuga. According to Kasuga, all of his family members are big-boned. His mother used to be a softball player. Kasuga had a fanatical female fan called \"Ochimusha\" (stray samurai) when he was a football player in high school. From the age of 20, he had a girlfriend (called \"Dogu\" (clay doll) by Wakabayashi) for five years. When he dated her, his friends called him \"Moai\" due to his big head, and named the two \"the mysterious couple.\" She later said on the TV program \"London Hearts\" that he was gentle, but she separated from him because she did not like his indecisiveness. On the show, unexpectedly meeting her at a bar, he got very nervous and passed her once but looked back at her repeatedly. (He just looked like he was \"spinning around.\")On his birthday, February 9, 2009, he was photographed by a paparazzo during the night while he was dating a 30-year-old woman who, according to Wakabayashi, resembles the \"Hippo of Isodin.\" (One of Japanese confectionery/pharmaceutical company Meiji Seika\\'s anime characters. See the \"External Links\" section below). Kasuga later said that he was going to make her his girlfriend, but after the photo\\'s publication, he was unsuccessful in reaching her.In April, 2019, Kasuga proposed to his girlfriend of 11 years \"Kumi-san\" on the television variety Monitoring. == Media == === TV === Campus Night Fuji (キャンパスナイト･フジ) -- Fuji Television/CX (4/10/2009-) School Kakumei (スクール革命!) -- Nippon Television (4/5/2009-) Merengue no Kimochi (メレンゲの気持ち) -- Nippon Television (4/25/2009-) *Every three weeks Zenbu Uso (ぜんぶウソ) -- Nippon Television (10/3/2009-) Morita Kazuyoshi Hour Waratte Iitomo!

              " 'James Calvin Wilsey (July 12, 1957 – December 24, 2018) was an American musician. He played bass with San Francisco punk band the Avengers, but became better known as the lead guitarist for Chris Isaak\\'s band Silvertone. He featured on Isaak\\'s albums Silvertone, Chris Isaak, Heart Shaped World, and San Francisco Days, and is widely remembered for his distinctive guitar tone and technique, being dubbed the \"King of Slow\" by fans. After leaving Isaak\\'s band, Wilsey pursued various solo projects while struggling with drug addiction and, toward the end of his life, periods of homelessness. He died from multiple organ failure related to hepatitis and drug use. == Musical style == Wilsey\\'s 1965 Fender Stratocaster and use of reverb, delay and gentle vibrato gave a distinctive sound to Isaak hits such as \"Wicked Game\" (the opening two-note riff, in his own words, \"crystallizes Wilsey\\'s approach\") and \"Blue Hotel\". Producer Erik Jacobsen remarked, \"In terms of the feeling Jimmy was able to put into a song with the wang bar and the tremolo and effects — Jimmy had a really magical touch...\" == Career == In 1977, Wilsey joined the Avengers, a pioneering band in the San Francisco punk rock scene. The band notably opened for the Sex Pistols at the Winterland Ballroom in January 1978, which led to Pistols guitarist Steve Jones sponsoring their recording career. Though the Avengers only released two EPs and a few compilation tracks during their initial run, the band influenced later San Francisco bands such as Dead Kennedys and Flipper, with Dead Kennedys bassist Klaus Fluoride praising Wilsey\\'s use of octaves.Wilsey joined Chris Isaak\\'s band Silvertone shortly after its formation in 1980. They initially played in many local San Francisco night clubs. Isaak recalled upon Wilsey\\'s death that \"Jimmy had so much heart and a great sound\". However, the two became estranged by the early 1990s due to Wilsey\\'s impatience with Isaak\\'s behavior and his own worsening drug problems.In 1998, Wilsey formed a short-lived instrumental band called the Mysteries. Dropping the moniker \"Calvin\", Wilsey released a solo album of guitar instrumentals in 2008, titled El Dorado, which paid homage to musical influences such as Duane Eddy, the Shadows, Billy Strange, James Burton and Link Wray. Wilsey\\'s last commercial recording under his own name was in 2012, when he contributed a cover of Johnny Cash\\'s \"The Man Comes Around\" to the soundtrack to the film Killing Them Softly. In 2017, he played guitar on Miss Derringer\\'s cover of \"Unchained Melody\". == Personal life and death == In the 1990s, Wilsey met fashion boutique owner and designer Winter Mullender. They married in 2003 and had a son, Waylon. They divorced in 2008. Wilsey\\'s health declined and in 2013 he developed hepatitis C and cirrhosis of the liver. His drug use reportedly continued during this time. He reconnected and temporarily cohabited with Mullender, but they were evicted in 2018 and became homeless. Wilsey was taken to LAC+USC Medical Center in December of that year with the onset of organ failure, and died on the afternoon of Christmas Eve. == Selected discography == === Solo === El Dorado (2008) === With the Avengers === We Are the One EP (1977) Avengers EP (1979) Avengers (1983) Died for Your Sins (1999) Zero Hour (2003) The American in Me (2004) Live at Winterland 1978 (2010) === With Chris Isaak === Silvertone (1985) Chris Isaak (1986) Heart Shaped World (1989) San Francisco Days (1993) == References == == External links == James Calvin Wilsey at AllMusic James Calvin Wilsey discography at Discogs James Calvin Wilsey at IMDb https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/195565825/james-calvin-wilsey',\n",

              " 'Interstate 35 (I-35) is a north–south Interstate Highway that stretches from Laredo, Texas, to Duluth, Minnesota. In the US state of Minnesota, I-35 enters from Iowa and heads north toward the twin cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul. South of the metropolitan area, I-35 splits into two branches; I-35E runs through Saint Paul and I-35W through Minneapolis. These two branches rejoin north of the Twin Cities, and the highway continues north to Duluth, where it terminates at State Highway 61 (MN 61). The highway was authorized in 1956 and the first segment opened in 1958. It reached Duluth in 1971, and the final segment to east Duluth opened in 1992. == Route description == I-35 enters the state from Iowa near Albert Lea. It heads roughly due north toward the Twin Cities, where it splits into I-35E and I-35W. The two halves of I-35 rejoin north of the Twin Cities. From there, I-35 travels north-northeast; south of Duluth, it becomes more northeasterly. The route ends near the shore of Lake Superior in Duluth. The entire route is officially designated the Red Bull Highway, named after the 34th Infantry (Red Bull) Division. Legally, I-35 is defined as Routes 390, 395, and 396 in the Minnesota Statutes §161.12(2), but the route is not marked with those numbers. The I-35 legislative route designation and mileposts follow I-35E in the Twin Cities area. === Southern segment === I-35 enters the state in Freeborn County south of Albert Lea. The first one mile (1.6 km) northbound contains a rest area and Minnesota welcome center. Shortly after the first exit, for County Road 5 (CR 5), there is a sweeping S-curve to the northwest and back to the north. The exit for CR 13 marks the last exit before Albert Lea. Up to here, the Interstate roughly marked the halfway point between U.S. Route 65 (US 65) and US 69. Both U.S. Highways end in Albert Lea. In Albert Lea, it curves to the northeast and meets US 65, which passes beneath the Interstate. US 65 picks up Business Loop Interstate 35 (BL I-35), which follows the US Highway through the city. It then crosses Albert Lea Lake of a pair of 0.25-mile-long (0.40 km) bridges. It straightens back to the north to meet CR 46, which follows the former route of US 16. Shortly after that interchange, it intersects the national northern end of US 65; access to US 65 there is limited to the southbound lanes of I-35, and traffic from US 65 can only access the northbound lanes of I-35. At the northeastern edge of Albert Lea, there is an interchange with I-90, which directs traffic toward La Crosse, Wisconsin, or Sioux Falls, South Dakota. I-35 continues north through the rolling hills of southern Minnesota. At Clarks Grove, it intersects MN 251. Between there and the CR 35 exit to Geneva, it passes to the west of Geneva Lake. Just east of Ellendale is an interchange with MN 30. Exit 32, CR 4 to Hope, is the last interchange before Owatonna. On the southern edge of Owatonna is a cloverleaf interchange with US 14. North of CR 45, the CR 34 exit serves northern Owatonna and provides access to the Owatonna Degner Regional Airport. The CR 9 exit serves Clinton Falls and a Cabela\\'s store. Further north, I-35 meets CR 12 and CR 23 in Medford. Along CR 23, which serves as a western frontage road to I-35, lies an outlet mall. Now in Rice County, the Interstate approaches Faribault. Exit 55 only serves exiting northbound traffic and entering southbound traffic. MN 60 is the main east–west street through Faribault, and MN 21 provides access to Faribault from the north of town. To the south, MN 21 ends at MN 60, but the road continues south and reconnects to I-35 at exit 55. North of Faribault, the Interstate heads due north before the two directions are briefly separated when they enter a corridor of trees. The route straightens out again and intersects CR 1 and MN 19 at diamond interchanges spaced three miles (4.8 km) apart. It briefly enters Scott County where it meets CR 2 near Elko New Market. It then enters Dakota County and the Minneapolis–St. Paul metropolitan area. In southwestern Lakeville, there is a folded diamond interchange with CR 70. Right before a partial cloverleaf interchange with CR 60, the Interstate crosses Marion Lake. Shortly after an interchange with CR 5 and CR 50, there is a park and ride complex on the northbound side of the Interstate. An entrance and exit ramp provide access to the Interstate while two entrances from Kendrick Avenue, a frontage road, provide non-Interstate access to the complex. After the CR 46 interchange, the Interstate enters Burnsville. A half diamond interchange, with only northbound exit and southbound entrance ramps, immediately precedes the split. I-35 splits into I-35W and I-35E (signed for Minneapolis and Saint Paul, respectively). === Northern segment === I-35W and I-35E join again at Columbus, near Forest Lake. The route then continues as I-35. In contrast to the rolling terrain of I-35 south of the Twin Cities area, this region is quite flat. This is the Anoka Sand Plain, an area that was formed by outwash under the last glaciers that lay over this area as they melted. This is an extensive region that continues north for another 20 miles (32 km). The urban sprawl of the northern Twin Cities continues along I-35 to North Branch. In Pine City and Hinckley, there are museums near I-35: the Pine City one at a refurbished fur trading post and interpretive center and the Hinckley one commemorating the Great Hinckley Forest Fire that occurred in 1894. Motorists who take BL I-35 through Pine City can experience a quintessential all-American main street. Between Sandstone and Moose Lake, the landscape around I-35 makes a dramatic change. Exposed granite can be seen at the surface, and the deciduous forest changes to evergreens. I-35 climbs Thompson Hill as it approaches the city of Duluth. As the highway enters the city limits at Boundary Avenue, the Saint Louis Bay and Lake Superior are in view. I-35 then descends Thompson Hill into Duluth, with numerous exits. The freeway has an interchange with I-535/US 53, known locally as the \"Can of Worms\". The junction features a pair of left exits from I-35, a stoplight, and lane drops over the I-35 bridge. I-35 then proceeds to downtown Duluth. After multiple exits, I-35 leaves the downtown area and follows the Lake Superior shoreline for two miles (3.2 km) to its national northern terminus at its junction with MN 61 and 26th Avenue East. At this junction where I-35 ends, MN 61 begins its route northeast along the North Shore of Lake Superior. == History == I-35 in Minnesota was authorized as part of the primary Interstate network in 1956. It was mostly constructed in the 1960s. The route in Minnesota replaced portions of old US 61 and old US 65. I-35 was generally constructed along former routes of US 65 south of the Twin Cities and US 61 north of the Twin Cities. The first section to be constructed (the first Interstate Highway opened in Minnesota) was about 10 miles (16 km) north of Owatonna, immediately west of present-day Steele CR 45 and Rice CR 45, which opened August 21, 1958. By 1961, the section of I-35 around Hinckley and Sandstone was under construction. Three lanes each way have been constructed on I-35 between the I-35E/I-35W split at Columbus to US 8 at Forest Lake. Three lanes have also been constructed on I-35 northbound at Thompson Hill, right before entering the city of Duluth. Additionally, three lanes have been constructed on I-35 southbound in Duluth at Thompson Hill between Central Avenue and US 2 westbound. Three lanes in each direction have also been constructed on I-35 in Duluth between the Can of Worms interchange (I-535/US 53) and the Mesaba Avenue interchange. From November 1971 to October 1987, the national northern terminus for I-35 was its interchange with Mesaba Avenue in Duluth. The last section of I-35 in Minnesota to be constructed was around downtown Duluth. The I-35 extension to Lake Avenue in Duluth was open to traffic in October 1987. The temporary I-35 extension to 10th Avenue East in Duluth was open to traffic in November 1989. The I-35 extension to its present-day junction with 26th Avenue East and MN 61 in Duluth was open to traffic in October 1992 after the construction of the Leif Erickson Tunnel. The section marked the final segment of the I-35 to be opened, and one of the last segments of the original Interstate Highway System.In 2002, all of I-35 in the state of Minnesota, from the Iowa state line to the city of Duluth, was officially designated the Red Bull Highway, after the 34th Infantry (Red Bull) Division, though plans to create signage never came to fruition. In practice, this name is seldom, if ever, used. == Exit list == == References == == External links == Interstate 35 at the Unofficial Minnesota Highways Page',\n",

The pageant is a pedestal for women who want to be the voice of celebrating beauty and harmony in diversity. May it be in the form of culture, race, belief, or opinion, we believe that all women are distinctly beautiful and one of a kind. Mission — Miss Asia Pacific International inspires women to be comfortable in their own skin and to believe that their individuality is one of the key qualities that make them distinctly beautiful. To provide opportunities for them to develop their skills, achieve their highest potential, and be the epitome of a strong, empowered. and confident woman. Vision — Miss Asia Pacific International is a platform for women to learn, improve, and ignite positive change within herself, and the global community. == History == The pageant was founded in 1965 as \"Miss Asia\" contest and the first titleholder was Angela Filmer from Malaysia. She was crowned by the wife of then President of the Philippines, Imelda Marcos on December 4, 1965. The contest had a humble beginning with only 18 countries participating in the first edition. The pageant was first only accepted contestants from Asia and Oceania countries to compete but the rules changed in 1985. The pageant\\'s title was changed to \"Miss Asia Pacific\" in 1984 then to \"Miss Asia Pacific Quest\" in 1985 after participants from countries in the Americas and the Pacific Ocean were allowed to compete. Since 2005, the pageant was again renamed to Miss Asia Pacific International and every countries from all over the world were allowed to participate in the competition. The pageant was not held in 1990 due to Luzon earthquake and in 1991 due to Mount Pinatubo eruption; also in 2004 and from 2006 to 2015.In 2005, winner Leonora Jimenez Monge from Costa Rica was dethroned after taking part in participating at Miss World contest. The first runner-up, Yevgeniya Lapova from Russia was given the crown and title. The pageant was then suspended after the conclusion of the 2005 edition. 12 years later in 2016, the pageant was revived and the winner was Tessa le Conge from the Netherlands.The most recent titleholder was Chaiyenne Huisman from Spain, who was crowned on 9 October 2019.Due to the restrictions brought about by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the organizers ceased to stage another competition since the last edition.

              " 'Jason Lee Von Flue (born August 1, 1975) is a former American mixed martial artist who appeared on the second season of The Ultimate Fighter. A professional competitor since 1999, he has competed for the UFC, WEC, Strikeforce and King of the Cage. In 2006, at UFC Ultimate Fight Night 3 against Alex Karalexis, Von Flue successfully applied a unique submission move to counter the guillotine choke that is now commonly referred to as the Von Flue choke. Additionally, since 2017, the \"Von Flue choke\" has occasionally been referred to as the \"Von Preux Choke\", due to its usage by Ovince Saint Preux. == Mixed martial arts career == === Early career === Von Flue made his professional MMA debut in June 1999, fighting and winning three times in one night on the International Fighting Championships WC 3: Warriors Challenge 3 show. Over the next six years, he amassed a record of 10 wins, 4 losses and 1 draw while fighting for promotions such as King of the Cage and World Extreme Cagefighting in his native California. === The Ultimate Fighter 2 === On episode three of The Ultimate Fighter 2, fighter Josh Burkman was asked to leave due to a broken arm and Von Flue came to the team of Matt Hughes as a replacement fighter. Considered the underdog, he went on to get an upset win in his first fight against Jorge Gurgel. Despite his performance, he was given to team Franklin when Hughes was forced to give up one of his members to the other team. He faced former teammate Joe Stevenson in the semifinals, losing due to an armbar submission. After his performance on the show, he was signed to a UFC contract. === Ultimate Fighting Championship === In his first match since the show, Von Flue fought at Ultimate Fight Night 3 where he defeated season one The Ultimate Fighter contestant Alex Karalexis via technical submission, as Karalexis was rendered unconscious by a shoulder choke from side control. This technique is now commonly known as a Von Flue Choke. Though this unique choke submission was around before Von Flue, he was perhaps the first person to get a technical submission on a large stage.In his second UFC match at Ultimate Fight Night 4, he was defeated by fellow TUF 2 contestant Luke Cummo via decision. For his third fight in the UFC, Von Flue faced Joe Riggs at UFC Fight Night 6 on August 17, 2006. He lost the fight via triangle choke submission, and was subsequently released from the promotion. === Strikeforce === Two months after his UFC release, Von Flue signed with now-defunct promotion Strikeforce. He debuted for the promotion on October 4, 2006, facing Eric Wray at Strikeforce: Tank vs. Buentello. He won the fight via arm-triangle choke. Von Flue then faced Cung Le at Strikeforce: Triple Threat on December 8, 2006. He lost the fight via doctor stoppage TKO, due to a cut that opened up on Von Flue. Von Flue faced Luke Stewart at Strikeforce Shamrock vs. Baroni and lost via TKO in the third round. He was subsequently released from the promotion following this loss. === Independent promotions === In his last fight in mixed martial arts, Von Flue faced Marcus Gaines at TWC: Trauma on July 23, 2009. He lost the fight via second round submission. Von Flue was scheduled to return from a near five-year retirement and face Conor Cooke at Cage Contender 18 on April 26, 2014, however the bout would be cancelled prior to the event for unknown reasons. == Mixed martial arts record == === Mixed martial arts exhibition match record === == References == == External links == Professional MMA record for Jason Von Flue from Sherdog Von Flue\\'s UFC Profile Jason Von Flue at IMDb Von Flue\\'s OFFICIAL MySpace',\n",

              " 'The bond valence method or mean method (or bond valence sum) (not to be mistaken for the valence bond theory in quantum chemistry) is a popular method in coordination chemistry to estimate the oxidation states of atoms. It is derived from the bond valence model, which is a simple yet robust model for validating chemical structures with localized bonds or used to predict some of their properties. This model is a development of Pauling\\'s rules. == Method == The basic method is that the valence V of an atom is the sum of the individual bond valences vi surrounding the atom: V = ∑ ( v i ) {\\\\displaystyle V=\\\\sum (v_{\\\\text{i}})} The individual bond valences in turn are calculated from the observed bond lengths. v i = exp \\u2061 ( R 0 − R i b ) {\\\\displaystyle v_{\\\\text{i}}=\\\\exp \\\\left({\\\\frac {R_{0}-R_{\\\\text{i}}}{b}}\\\\right)} Ri is the observed bond length, R0 is a tabulated parameter expressing the (ideal) bond length when the element i has exactly valence 1, and b is an empirical constant, typically 0.37 Å. Another formula for v i {\\\\displaystyle v_{\\\\text{i}}} has also been used: v i = ( R i R 0 ) − 6 {\\\\displaystyle v_{\\\\text{i}}=\\\\left({\\\\frac {R_{\\\\text{i}}}{R_{0}}}\\\\right)^{-6}} == Theory == === Introduction === Although the bond valence model is mostly used for validating newly determined structures, it is capable of predicting many of the properties of those chemical structures that can be described by localized bonds In the bond valence model, the valence of an atom, V, is defined as the number of electrons the atom uses for bonding. This is equal to the number of electrons in its valence shell if all the valence shell electrons are used for bonding. If they are not, the remainder will form non-bonding electron pairs, usually known as lone pairs. The valence of a bond, S, is defined as the number of electron pairs forming the bond. In general this is not an integral number. Since each of the terminal atoms contributes equal numbers of electrons to the bond, the bond valence is also equal to the number of valence electrons that each atom contributes. Further, since within each atom, the negatively charged valence shell is linked to the positively charged core by an electrostatic flux that is equal to the charge on the valence shell, it follows that the bond valence is also equal to the electrostatic flux that links the core to the electrons forming the bond. The bond valence is thus equal to three different quantities: the number of electrons each atom contributes to the bond, the number of electron pairs that form the bond, and the electrostatic flux linking each core to the bonding electron pair. === The valence sum rule === It follows from these definitions, that the valence of an atom is equal to the sum of the valences of all the bonds it forms. This is known as the valence sum rule, Eq. 1, which is central to the bond valence model. V = s u m ( S j ) {\\\\displaystyle V=sum(S_{j})} (Eq. 1)A bond is formed when the valence shells of two atoms overlap. It is apparent that the closer two atoms approach each other, the larger the overlap region and the more electrons are associated with the bond. We therefore expect a correlation between the bond valence and the bond length and find empirically that for most bonds it can be described by Eq. 2: S = e x p ( ( R o − R ) / b ) {\\\\displaystyle S=exp((Ro-R)/b)} (Eq. 2)where S is the valence and R is the length of the bond, and Ro and b are parameters that are empirically determined for each bond type. For many bond types (but not all), b is found to be close to 0.37 Å. A list of bond valence parameters for different bond types (i.e. for different pairs of cation and anion in given oxidation states) can be found at the web site. It is this empirical relation that links the formal theorems of the bond valence model to the real world and allows the bond valence model to be used to predict the real structure, geometry and properties of a compound. If the structure of a compound is known, the empirical bond valence - bond length correlation of Eq. 2 can be used to estimate the bond valences from their observed bond lengths. Eq. 1 can then be used to check that the structure is chemically valid; any deviation between the atomic valence and the bond valence sum needs to be accounted for. === The distortion theorem === Eq. 2 is used to derive the distortion theorem which states that the more the individual bond lengths in a coordination sphere deviate from their average, the more the average bond length increases provided the valence sum is kept constant. Alternatively if the average bond length is kept constant, the more the bond valence sum increases === The valence matching rule === If the structure is not known, the average bond valence, Sa can be calculated from the atomic valence, V, if the coordination number, N, of the atom is known using Eq. 3. S a = V / N {\\\\displaystyle S_{a}=V/N} (Eq. 3)If the coordination number is not known, a typical coordination number for the atom can be used instead. Some atoms, such as sulfur(VI), are only found with one coordination number with oxygen, in this case 4, but others, such as sodium, are found with a range of coordination numbers, though most lie close to the average, which for sodium is 6.2. In the absence of any better information, the average coordination number observed with oxygen is a convenient approximation, and when this number is used in Eq. 3, the resulting average bond valence is known as the bonding strength of the atom. Since the bonding strength of an atom is the valence expected for a bond formed by that atom, it follows that the most stable bonds will be formed between atoms with the same bonding strengths. In practice some tolerance is allowed, but bonds are rarely formed if the ratio of the bonding strengths of the two atoms exceeds two, a condition expressed by the inequality shown in Eq. 4. This is known and the valence matching rule. 0.5 < ( S 1 / S 2 ) < 2.0 {\\\\displaystyle 0.5<(S_{1}/S_{2})<2.0} (Eq. 4)Atoms with non-bonding valence electrons, i.e., with lone pairs, have more flexibility in their bonding strength than those without lone pairs depending on whether the lone pairs are stereoactive or not. If the lone pairs are not stereoactive, they are spread uniformly around the valence shell, if they are stereoactive they are concentrated in one portion of the coordination sphere preventing that portion from forming bonds. This results in the atom having a smaller coordination number, hence a higher bonding strength, when the lone pair is stereoactive. Ions with lone pairs have a greater ability to adapt their bonding strength to match that of the counter-ion. The lone pairs become stereoactive when the bonding strength of the counter-ion exceeds twice the bonding strength of the ion when its lone pairs are inactive.Compounds that do not satisfy Eq. 4 are difficult, if not impossible, to prepare, and chemical reactions tend to favour the compounds that provide the best valence match. For example, the aqueous solubility of a compound depends on whether its ions are better matched to water than they are to each other. === Electronegativity === Several factors influence the coordination number of an atom, but the most important of these is its size; larger atoms have larger coordination numbers. The coordination number depends on the surface area of the atom, and so is proportional to r2. If VE is the charge on the atomic core (which is the same as the valence of the atom when all the electrons in the valence shell are bonding), and NE is the corresponding average coordination number, VE/NE is proportional to the electric field at the surface of the core, represented by SE in Eq. 5: S E = V E / N E {\\\\displaystyle S_{E}=V_{E}/N_{E}} (Eq. 5)Not surprisingly, SE gives the same ordering of the main group elements as the electronegativity, though it differs in its numerical value from traditional electronegativity scales. Because it is defined in structural terms, SE is the preferred measure of electronegativity in the bond valence model, === The ionic model === The bond valence model can be reduced to the traditional ionic model if certain conditions are satisfied. These conditions require that atoms be divided into cations and anions in such a way that (a) the electronegativity of every anion is equal to, or greater than, the electronegativity of any of the cations, (b) that the structure is electroneutral when the ions carry charges equal to their valence, and (c) that all the bonds have a cation at one end and an anion at the other. If these conditions are satisfied, as they are in many ionic and covalent compounds, the electrons forming a bond can all be formally assigned to the anion. The anion thus acquires a formal negative charge and the cation a formal positive charge, which is the picture on which the ionic model is based. The electrostatic flux that links the cation core to its bonding electrons now links the cation core to the anion. In this picture, a cation and anion are bonded to each other if they are linked by electrostatic flux, with the flux being equal to the valence of the bond. In a representative set of compounds Preiser et al. have confirmed that the electrostatic flux is the same as the bond valence determined from the bond lengths using Eq. 2. The association of the cation bonding electrons with the anion in the ionic model is purely formal. There is no change in physical locations of any electrons, and there is no change in the bond valence. The terms \"anion\" and \"cation\" in the bond valence model are defined in terms of the bond topology, not the chemical properties of the atoms. This extends the scope of the ionic model well beyond compounds in which the bonding would normally be considered as \"ionic\". For example, methane, CH4, obeys the conditions for the ionic model with carbon as the cation and hydrogen as the anion (or vice versa, since carbon and hydrogen have the same electronegativity). For compounds that contain cation-cation or anion-anion bonds it is usually possible to transform these homoionic bonds into cation-anion bonds either by treating the atoms linked by the homoionic bond as a single complex cation (e.g., Hg22+), or by treating the bonding electrons in the homoionic bond as a pseudo-anion to transform a cation-cation bond into two cation - pseudo-anion bonds, e.g., Hg2+-e2−-Hg2+. === The covalent model === Structures containing covalent bonds can be treated using the ionic model providing they satisfy the topological conditions given above, but a special situation applies to hydrocarbons which allows the bond valence model to be reduced to the traditional bond model of organic chemistry. If an atom has a valence, V, that is equal to its coordination number, N, its bonding strength according to Eq. 3 is exactly 1.0 vu (valence units), a condition that greatly simplifies the model. This condition is obeyed by carbon, hydrogen and silicon. Since these atoms all have bonding strengths of 1.0 vu the bonds between them are all predicted to have integral valences with carbon forming four single bonds and hydrogen one. Under these conditions, the bonds are all single bonds (or multiples of single bonds). Compounds can be constructed by linking carbon and hydrogen atoms with bonds that are all exactly equivalent. Under certain conditions, nitrogen can form three bonds and oxygen two, but since nitrogen and oxygen typically also form hydrogen bonds, the resulting N-H and O-H bonds have valences less than 1.0 vu, leading through the application of Eq. 1, to the C-C and C-H bonds having valences that differ from 1.0 vu. Nevertheless, the simple bonding rules of organic chemistry are still good approximations, though the rules of the bond valence model are better. === Predicting bonding geometry === A chemical structure can be represented by a bond network of the kind familiar in molecular diagrams. The infinitely connected bond networks found in crystals can be simplified into finite networks by extracting one formula unit and reconnecting any broken bonds to each other. If the bond network is not known, a plausible network can be created by connecting well matched cations and anions that satisfy Eq. 4. If the finite network contains only cation-anion bonds, every bond can be treated as an electric capacitor (two equal and opposite charges linked by electrostatic flux). The bond network is thus equivalent to a capacitive electrical circuit with the charge on each capacitor being equivalent to the bond valence. The individual bond capacitors are not initially known, but in the absence of any information to the contrary we assume that they are all equal. In this case the circuit can be solved using the Kirchhoff equations, yielding the valences of each bond. Eq. 2 can then be used to calculate bond lengths which are found to lie within a few picometres of the observed bond lengths if no additional constraints are present. Additional constraints include electronic anisotropies (lone pairs and Jahn-Teller distortions) or steric constraints, (bonds stretched or compressed in order to fit them into three-dimensional space). Hydrogen bonds are an example of a steric constraint. The repulsion resulting from the close approach of the donor and acceptor atoms causes the bonds to be stretched, and under this constraint the distortion theorem predicts that the hydrogen atom will move off-center.The bond valence is a vector directed along the bond since it represents the electrostatic field linking the ions. If the atom is unconstrained, the sum of the bond valence vectors around an atom is expected to be zero, a condition that limits the range of possible bond angles. === Strengths and limitations of the model === The bond valence model is an extension of the electron counting rules and its strength lies in its simplicity and robustness. Unlike most models of chemical bonding, it does not require a prior knowledge of the atomic positions and so can be used to construct chemically plausible structures given only the composition. The empirical parameters of the model are tabulated and are readily transferable between bonds of the same type. The concepts used are familiar to chemists and provide ready insight into the chemical restraints acting on the structure. The bond valence model uses mostly classical physics, and with little more than a pocket calculator, it gives quantitative predictions of bond lengths and places limits on what structures can be formed. However, like all models, the bond valence model has its limitations. It is restricted to compounds with localized bonds; it does not, in general, apply to metals or aromatic compounds where the electrons are delocalized. It cannot in principle predict electron density distributions or energies since these require the solution of the Schoedinger equation using the long-range Coulomb potential which is incompatible with the concept of a localized bond. == History == The bond valence method is a development of Pauling\\'s rules. In 1930, Lawrence Bragg showed that Pauling\\'s electrostatic valence rule could be represented by electrostatic lines of force emanating from cations in proportion to the cation charge and ending on anions. The lines of force are divided equally between the bonds to the corners of the coordination polyhedron. Starting with Pauling in 1947 a correlation between cation–anion bond length and bond strength was noted. It was shown later that if bond lengths were included in the calculation of bond strength, its accuracy was improved, and this revised method of calculation was termed the bond valence. These new insights were developed by later workers culminating in the set of rules termed the bond valence model. == Actinide oxides == It is possible by bond valence calculations to estimate how great a contribution a given oxygen atom is making to the assumed valence of uranium. Zachariasen lists the parameters to allow such calculations to be done for many of the actinides. Bond valence calculations use parameters which are estimated after examining a large number of crystal structures of uranium oxides (and related uranium compounds); note that the oxidation states which this method provides are only a guide which assists in the understanding of a crystal structure. For uranium binding to oxygen the constants R0 and B are tabulated in the table below. For each oxidation state use the parameters from the table shown below. == Doing the calculations == It is possible to do these simple calculations on paper or to use software. A program which does it can be obtained free of charge. In 2020 David Brown published a nearly comprehensive set of bond valence parameters on the IuCr web site. == References ==',\n",

              " 'Stepfather is the fifth album by the People Under the Stairs. The album signified a departure from the group\\'s previous, Golden age hip hop sound, and the album introduced a more widely varied array of sample sources. The album also spawned two singles, \"Tuxedo Rap\" and \"Pass The 40\". Distribution of the album was handled in the United States by the local Los Angeles label Basement Records, and the release overseas was handled by Tres Records, a label co-founded by Thes One with Chikara Kurahashi from Giant Panda. == Background == After the release of the People Under the Stairs\\' previous record, ...Or Stay Tuned and another world tour, Thes One and Double K found themselves free of their record contract with Om Records, and as a result, the group felt more personally responsible for the direction of their music. They also took some time to record side projects, and Thes One married his longtime girlfriend. The group started to move away from the \"party life\" they had enjoyed while making the previous albums, and the musical and lyrical themes that would be present on their next record reflected that growth. == Recording == When they began work on the new album in 2005, Thes One and Double K were feeling that sample-based hip hop was becoming repetitive and gravitating increasingly toward overused jazz samples. They even went so far as to feel critical of the success of their final Om releases, O.S.T. and ...Or Stay Tuned. The group was also unhappy with the rise in internet music piracy and the drive by music companies to push artists toward \"hot singles\" and away from themed albums. Due to all these factors, People Under the Stairs made a conscious decision to be as different and unique as possible in their attempt to create a cohesive album with a broader, less jazzy sound palette. They felt they had to step away from what they perceived as a stale hip hop scene as it existed in Los Angeles.Determined to make their new album all about the new musical direction they were taking, Thes One and Double K released Stepfather with an extremely toned-down, minimalist album cover by Thes One\\'s long time friend, Joshua Dunn of the design team Secret Pizza Party (who later became an editor for Wax Poetics). The cover was meant to look like a \"working copy\" record sleeve, with just the group\\'s name in Umbra font and two fireworks prints, as well as the album\\'s name and a phone number.People Under the Stairs invited keyboardist Kat Ouano of the Oakland-based Crown City Rockers to play on the album-closing track, \"On & On\". Her bandmate, Headnodic, had played on People Under the Stairs\\' third album, O.S.T., and both musicians have since been invited back several times on subsequent releases. Double K, a lifelong fan of the P-Funk collective, also invited George Clinton to be a part of the album, and Clinton agreed. He appears on the track \"The Doctor and the Kidd\". While record digging at a flea market in Mexico City in 2005, Thes One came across a copy of the EP, Matt the Cat, by Matthew Cassell, a musician who recorded a small body of material during the late 1970s. Thes One was instantly drawn to the record, and believing it to be a Mexican album, he included a sample of \"All I\\'m Missing is You\" by Cassell on the People Under the Stairs track \"You\". When Cassell discovered that Thes One (and other DJs) had re-discovered his music, he requested that his name be included in the writing credits for the tracks on which he was sampled, including \"You\". == Fake leak == Stepfather was released during the peer-to-peer file sharing explosion, and subsequently, many unauthorized demos and bootlegs of forthcoming albums were finding their way into the hands of fans before the artists could release finalized albums. As a precautionary measure, Thes One and Double K recorded a \"fake album\" (also titled Stepfather), and intentionally leaked the fake album (with the help of the People Under the Stairs online message board) onto the internet on February 21, 2006. The leak consisted of several tracks of Thes One reciting The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, sandwiched between introductory and concluding tracks which ridiculed the listener for being too eager to get the album. The fake leak (along with three bonus tracks) was later released as a promotional CD called Redheaded Stepfather: The Fake Leak in collaboration with the online retailer HipHopSite.com and given away with pre-orders of the album. == Reception and touring == Stepfather debuted at #32 on the Billboard Heatseaker Chart and #35 on the Billboard Independent Albums chart. Allmusic, in a positive review, stated that the album \"successfully combines rhymes, beats, groove, and flow into one really coherent, 20-song record\" and called the group \"experienced leaders who\\'ve made their mark in the music\". Upon release of the album, Tiny Mix Tapes reviewer Alan Ranta also called the group \"movement leaders\" of \"culturally positive hip-hop\" and called the album \"the type of music that saves lives and makes good days great\".At initial in-store concerts in support of the album, Thes One and Double K noticed that the average age of the people coming out to support them was much younger than they were expecting. Excited that they were reaching a new generation of hip hop fans, the group asked for their United States tour dates to be \"all ages\" shows and in-store appearances at record shops in an effort to reach out to the new young audience.They toured the US through Spring 2006, taking along the then-unknown rock-rap group Gym Class Heroes as their opening act. In the Summer and Fall of 2006, the group embarked on another world tour, visiting Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Europe. For the Europe leg of the tour, they were accompanied by Giant Panda. In 2007, the group made additional visits to the UK and the Western United States. == Track listing == All songs written by Christopher \"Thes One\" Portugal and Michael \"Double K\" Turner, except where noted.

              " 'In carbohydrate chemistry, the Lobry de Bruyn–Van Ekenstein transformation also known as the Lobry de Bruyn–Alberda van Ekenstein transformation is the base or acid catalyzed transformation of an aldose into the ketose isomer or vice versa, with a tautomeric enediol as reaction intermediate. Ketoses may be transformed into 3-ketoses, etcetera. The enediol is also an intermediate for the epimerization of an aldose or ketose. The reactions are usually base catalyzed, but can also take place under acid or neutral conditions. A typical rearrangement reaction is that between the aldose glyceraldehyde and the ketose dihydroxyacetone in a chemical equilibrium. The Lobry de Bruyn–Van Ekenstein transformation is relevant for the industrial production of certain ketoses and was discovered in 1885 by Cornelis Adriaan Lobry van Troostenburg de Bruyn and Willem Alberda van Ekenstein. == Aldose-ketose transformation == The following scheme describes the interconversion between an aldose and a ketose, where R is any organic residue. The equilibrium or the reactant to product ratio depends on concentration, solvent, pH and temperature. At equilibrium the aldose and ketose form a mixture which in the case of the glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone is also called glycerose. A related reaction is the alpha-ketol rearrangement. == Epimerization == The carbon atom at which the initial deprotonation takes place is a stereocenter. If, for example, D-glucose (an Aldose) rearranges to D-fructose, the ketose, the stereochemical configuration is lost in the enol form. In the chemical reaction the enol can be protonated from two faces, resulting in the backformation of glucose or the formation of the epimer D-mannose. The final product is a mix of D-glucose, D-fructose and D-mannose. == References ==',\n",

              " 'Subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord, also known as myelosis funiculus, or funicular myelosis, also Lichtheim\\'s disease, and Putnam-Dana syndrome, refers to degeneration of the posterior and lateral columns of the spinal cord as a result of vitamin B12 deficiency (most common), vitamin E deficiency, and copper deficiency. It is usually associated with pernicious anemia. == Signs and symptoms == The onset is gradual and uniform. The pathological findings of subacute combined degeneration consist of patchy losses of myelin in the dorsal and lateral columns. Patients present with weakness of the legs, arms, and trunk, and tingling and numbness that progressively worsens. Vision changes and change of mental state may also be present. Bilateral spastic paresis may develop and pressure, vibration and touch sense are diminished. A positive Babinski sign may be seen. Prolonged deficiency of vitamin B12 leads to irreversible nervous system damage. HIV-associated vacuolar myelopathy can present with a similar pattern of dorsal column and corticospinal tract demyelination.It has been thought that if someone is deficient in vitamin B12 and folic acid, the vitamin B12 deficiency must be treated first. However, the basis for this has been challenged, although due to ethical considerations it is no longer able to be tested if \"neuropathy is made more severe as a result of giving folic acid to vitamin B12- deficient individuals\". And that if this were the case, then the mechanism remains unclear.Administration of nitrous oxide anesthesia can precipitate subacute combined degeneration in people with subclinical vitamin B12 deficiency, while chronic nitrous oxide exposure can cause it even in persons with normal B12 levels. Posterior column dysfunction decreases vibratory sensation and proprioception (joint sense). Lateral corticospinal tract dysfunction produces spasticity and dorsal spinocerebellar tract dysfunction causes ataxia. == Cause == In general, the most common cause of this condition is a deficiency of vitamin B12. This may be due to a dietary deficiency, malabsorption in the terminal ileum, lack of intrinsic factor secreted from gastric parietal cells, or low gastric pH inhibiting attachment of intrinsic factor to ileal receptors. The disease can also be caused by inhalation of nitrous oxide, which inactivates vitamin B12.Vitamin E deficiency, which is associated with malabsorption disorders such as cystic fibrosis and Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome, can cause a similar presentation due to the degeneration of the dorsal columns. == Diagnosis == Serum vitamin B12, methylmalonic acid, Schilling test, and a complete blood count, looking for megaloblastic anemia if there is also folic acid deficiency or macrocytic anemia. The Schilling test is no longer available in most areas.MRI-T2 images may reveal increased signal within the white matter of the spinal cord, predominantly in the posterior columns and possibly in the spinothalamic tracts. == Treatment == Therapy with vitamin B12 results in partial to full recovery where SACD has been caused by vitamin B12 deficiency, depending on the duration and extent of neurodegeneration. == References == == External links ==',\n",

[...] And feel passionate bliss to enjoy with animal joy the opportunity to represent this form in all activities and on the physiognomy display fleeting expressions and to distinguish the characteristics of a precise contours [...] to depict seeing in this image, in this profile an extreme limit of humanity expression, human history but also the history of our time described simultaneously. The two Greek painters Yannis Moralis and John Tsarouhis belong to this \"mystical company.\" because as I saw in Venice their projects, and was glad, because to the same sect, I belonged too. == References == == Bibliography == Καψάλης, Δ.

              " 'Legal matter management or matter management refers to activities involved in managing all aspects of the corporate legal practice (\"matters\"). Matter management is distinguished from case management, in that case management is generally considered to refer to law firm related activities (\"cases\"). Matter management software systems serve a variety of functions including conflict and ethics control, accurate matter opening, day-to-day matter work, business intelligence, and marketing. This includes the tracking of such items as the attorneys and other workers on the case, type of legal work, industry of the client, witnesses, judges, Courts, opposing counsel, issues, documents, budgets and invoices associated with each particular legal matter. Corporations can use matter legal matter management software and systems to manage both their in-house counsel staffs as well as their outside counsel law firms and non-law firm legal service providers who work on legal matters on the corporation\\'s behalf (i.e., expert witnesses, court reporters, copy services, etc.). Law firms might use matter management to organize information about documents and email, time worked or billed, people inside and outside the firm associated with case, deadlines and dockets, and much more. Matter management systems can provide excellent communication and collaboration platforms to organize and distribute information, although new web-based collaboration tools are beginning to reduce the need for matter management systems as collaboration tools. Matter-centric collaboration tools may be the next step. As these systems entail the processing and storage of confidential corporate and insurance carrier financial data, sensitive claims information, and privileged legal matter data, major considerations in the deployment of these systems are: availability of matter-level security, ability to handle ethical walls, the level of customization the software offers, whether the software can be installed \"behind corporate security and firewalls\" or if the software is only hosted as an Internet-based ASP application and whether or not the deployment methodology meets Sarbanes-Oxley and HIPAA security and audit compliance mandates. Legal project management is a form of matter management that leverages the standards and practices of professional project management to more effectively manage legal matters or specific phases of a legal matter (e.g., legal-discovery projects).',\n",

              " 'Lochiel is a heritage-listed villa at 6 Hillside Crescent, Hamilton, City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. It was built from 1860s to 1920s. It is also known as Balmoral, Langley Grove, and Runnymeade. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 May 1999. == History == Lochiel comprises a substantial timber and masonry residence together with associated outbuildings (the former stables, shed, and lych gate) set within substantial grounds on the lower reaches of Toorak Hill overlooking the Hamilton Reach of the Brisbane River. The house has evolved over several stages: its genesis is believed to be a two-story masonry house erected by John Francis Buckland in the 1860s. After the house was purchased by John Samuel Cameron (the younger) in 1899 two timber additions were undertaken: a museum wing by 1906 and a first floor addition over the eastern wing by 1927. The layout of the garden is also believed to date from Cameron\\'s ownership. Lochiel remains in the ownership of the Cameron family; the house having been converted into flats after World War II. This history is based entirely on publicly held records. It is believed that further information is held by the Cameron family, which may well contribute further to its understanding.The land on which Lochiel stands forms part of an original deed of grant of 5 acres (2.0 ha) (described as allotment 5 of portion 1) made in April 1855 to John James Perry and William Anthony Brown both of Brisbane. It is not known whether the land was occupied at this time, however Nehemiah Bartley writing in 1854 describes a foot track over Toorak Hill (then called Gage\\'s Hill) to German Station at Nundah so avoiding the longer route by the river bank. Prior to 1845 squatting licences were known to have been granted in this vicinity (including to Gage who cleared land, and planted maize and vegetables). On the other side of Breakfast Creek, just three years after the declaration of free settlement and the first Brisbane land sales, land was offered for sale including the Newstead House, Brisbane parcel (house erected 1845/6).The value of the Breakfast Creek / Hamilton district had been recognised from the earliest settlement of Brisbane. In 1824, prior to the resiting of the Moreton Bay penal colony from Redcliffe to Brisbane, it was Breakfast Creek which was nominated by Governor Brisbane and John Oxley as a more suitable place for settlement with the rocky point now known as Cameron Rocks identified as having good anchorage and a natural wharf. The first known settlement in the district however came with the establishment in 1829 of Eagle Farm as an annexe to the penal colony. The construction of the Eagle Farm Road by convicts (later also called Breakfast Creek Road and Hamilton Road, now Kingsford Smith Drive) and a bridge across Breakfast Creek later providing impetus for the early development of the area.In 1865 allotment 5 was transferred to Peter Nicol Russell described on the title as of London but according to electoral records resident at New Farm. In the same year this was subdivided into 15 lots. An 1864 advertisement for sale of nearby lands describes the area along the Eagle Farm Road as \"at all times the most favourite direction for suburban residence, it has of late been even more enquired after for similar purposes ... Very great improvements have attended the progress of this locality during the last twelve months\".According to title\\'s information, on 21 September 1867 (but possibly some two years earlier), three of the subdivided parcels of allotment 5 (subs 11, 12, and 13) containing 2 roods 16 perches (2,400 m2) were transferred to Ellen Gertrude Buckland. EG Buckland (?-1911) was the wife of John Francis Buckland (1832–1910). JF Buckland arrived in Queensland in 1862 from England establishing an auctioneering partnership with Simon Fraser (Fraser & Buckland 1863–1873); later in business on his own account as an auctioneer and broker. He was an original member of the Nundah Divisional Board (created 1880/1) until 1883 when he became the first Chairman of the new Toombul Divisional Board of which he remained a member until the late 1880s when, with the creation of the new Hamilton Divisional Board, he no longer resided within the boundaries of Toombul. From 1882 to 1892 he was the Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for Bulimba.The first Post Office Directories (1868) record Buckland as residing at Breakfast Creek (which the area was known as). Based on a combination of the Post Office Directories and photographic evidence, it is the Bucklands who are believed to have erected what was to become the first stage of Lochiel. A photograph dated 1868 shows the house at this stage believed to have comprised 2 rooms upstairs with kitchen area below fronting what is now known as Hillside Crescent. No architect or builder has to date been identified although in 1864 Brisbane architect WH Chambers erected the Queen Street premises of Fraser and Buckland. During the Buckland\\'s residency the house appears to have been known firstly as Balmoral Cottage and from 1885 to 1886 as Runnymeade.The Bucklands\\' Toorak Hill neighbours at this time included several substantial residences: James Dickson\\'s \"Toorak\" (Toorak House) erected c. 1865, \"Eldernell\" (1869), \"Waterview\" (later \\'Camden House\\'; demolished), and \"Mt Pleasant\" (on the western side of Toorak Rd).In 1889 a further 2 roods 16 perches (2,400 m2) was added to the Runnymeade holding with resubs 11–16 of subs 6, 7, and 8 (with frontage to Dickson Terrace) being acquired again in the name of Ellen Gertrude Buckland. (This land is no longer part of the Lochiel holding and does not form part of the entry in the Heritage Register). A photograph dating from this time shows Runneymede as a masonry house in cottage orne style comprising a simple gabled front section with verandahs facing south and a gabled brick wing to the northeast, which has apparently been added by this time. The house and extension have distinctive bargeboards with wavy edges. The photograph also shows a roof in the location of the existing small shed located to the east of the house and a mature garden. In the same year the Bucklands acquired a near neighbour to the east when Kate Quinlan erected \"Maria Ville\" (later called \\'Eltham\\').In 1892, Buckland became insolvent although according to the Post Office Directories he remained at Runnymeade until the mid-1890s. From 1895 to 1897 the house is listed as vacant, but was apparently occupied for a short time thereafter by Fred Lawson (of Lawson and Johnson fancy goods dealers) and renamed Langley Grove.In 1899 the property was transferred by the mortgagee to John Samuel Cameron who renamed the house Lochiel. Cameron (1868–1917), son of John Samuel Cameron (1834–1902) and Frances Spencer Cameron was a partner in the Brisbane auctioneering firm established by his father, (John Cameron & Sons, which remains a family firm). JS Cameron Snr and his family are believed to have resided nearby to Lochiel (then Runnymeade) in the 1880s at Greenbank. In 1884 the family moved to Doowabah at Ormiston. In a manuscript held by the John Oxley Library, one of John Samuel Cameron\\'s three sisters recalls that the Camerons were very keen gardeners, and with the help of John Neish, the Scottish gardener Captain Hope of Ormiston House Estate had brought out with him, we soon had a wonderful flower and fruit garden which was greatly helped by the many sharks that were buried for fertilising purposes.In 1900 John Cameron jnr married Etty Florence Griffiths Higgins. The Lochiel household also included Marian Griffiths Higgins (later Brown; Etty\\'s daughter from her first marriage to Ernest Higgins) and two sons John Griffiths Cameron (born 1903) and Stuart Francis Griffiths Cameron (b1904). Photographs show the house and grounds prior to the erection of the museum c. 1906. The studio photographs which appear to be contemporaneous are taken from the south east and north east. They show the house prior to the enclosing of the verandahs as well as a good view of the eastern wing of the house (including a small separately roofed timber addition) prior to the addition of the upper story. The roofed area to the rear of the house is also shown. Garden structures including post and rail fences, trellises and a small building on the eastern boundary are visible.According to his sister Cameron was a keen collector, when young of Shells and Birds\\' Eggs and Native Weapons of all sorts but later became very interested in good China and Glass, particularly Bohemian and Venetian Glass, and his large collection contained many very beautiful specimens. Apparently to house his collection, by 1906, Cameron had added the museum to the western side of the house.Built of timber, the museum interior is shown in photographs as having decorative tie beams and hangers, high level windows, and a striped timber floor. The collection appears to have been highly personal and eclectic with aboriginal artefacts, oriental furniture, porcelain paintings, and sculptures filling the space. The purpose built museum is believed to be rare. To date only one other purpose built private museum has been identified: at \"Beaufort Hill\" Clayfield where in the 1920s Edward Hawkins had a museum room incorporated as part of a tower addition to an existing house.By 1906 the lychgate at the corner of Toorak Road and Hillside Crescent had also been erected. By this time Hamilton was well established as a suburb of Brisbane. In 1899 the electric tram service to Ascot commenced; subdivisions continued including that of the nearby Toorak Estate (following the death of James Dixon in 1901); in 1904 the town of Hamilton succeeded the Shire of Hamilton as the local authority area; and \"the Rocky Wharf\" (later called Cameron Rocks apparently in honour of JS Cameron), once described as the perfect landing place for a fledgling penal colony, was now a place for couples to \"spoon\" away the evening hours. A contemporary newspaper article describes the Hamilton township:\"The mansions and villas of many of Brisbane\\'s commercial men crown every green knoll, inviting the cool breezes of the eastern ocean ... Hamilton Road is a well-kept thoroughfare, and provides a much frequented drive, whilst the electric tramcars which traverse it are invariably filled on summer afternoons and evenings ... At the present time there are about 5,000 souls resident in Hamilton.\"In 1916 Cameron appointed his brothers Waverley Fletcher Cameron, Stuart William Cameron, and his wife Etty Florence Cameron as trustees. They remained as trustees administering his estate after his death in the following year on 26 April 1917. Under the terms of Cameron\\'s will, his wife continued to reside at Lochiel (including the enjoyment of the museum) until her death in August 1945 when Lochiel passed to their two sons.The Brisbane City Council Sewerage Detail Plan records that by 1927 an upper story had been added to Lochiel positioned over the early brick eastern wing, although based on photographic evidence this may have been as early as 1912. An undated photograph shows Lochiel after this addition which was detailed to match the museum wing. To date it has not been possible to identify who was responsible for this work. Based on drawings prepared by architects Job & Collins c. 1945 the upper floor was accessed by an internal stairwell from the existing eastern wing of the house.The 1927 sewerage plan shows Lochiel much as it is today although at this time the land holding still extended through to Dickson Terrace. The plan shows the small shed, garages (believed to be former stables) to the north west of the site, lychgate, and several other unidentified structures. In the 1930s half of the land holding (fronting Dickson Terrace) was reconfigured into three blocks – subs 1 and 2 with frontage to Dickson Terrace; sub 3 with a narrow frontage to Toorak Road. None of these blocks were sold but remained (as required by Cameron\\'s will) as part of the administered estate of John Samuel Cameron although sub 1 was leased from 1936 to one of the Cameron sons, John Griffiths Cameron. A house may have been erected on this site at this time.Following the death of Etty Florence Cameron in 1945, her two sons inherited the property as provided for under their father\\'s will. At this time the contents of the museum were apparently dispersed and architects Job & Collins prepared drawings for the conversion of the house into flats. One drawing also shows the pre-flat layout of the ground floor: the early masonry core of the house contains the dining room and a bedroom; the eastern wing, a bedroom, stairwell to upper level, maid\\'s room (in the timber portion), and bathroom on the verandah; to the rear of the house is the living room with stairs to basement level marked; kitchen, scullery, and associated service rooms to the west of the living room; the museum is shown with several entrances marked to other parts of the house. It is not known what use if any was made of the basement rooms (which in addition to the original kitchen rooms also includes a room under the museum). The second drawing documents the conversion of the house into the 6 existing flats.From 1947, the two Dickson Terrace blocks are separated from the main house block subs 11,12, and 13 and sub 3 (containing the house Lochiel) – each son acquiring a block with the house block being held in joint ownership. After the death of Stuart Cameron in 1972, the whole of what is now considered the Lochiel house block is acquired by John Griffiths Cameron. Lochiel was acquired by the present owners following the death of their father in 1976. A 1997 application for demolition which was refused by the Brisbane City Council attracted a considerable number of objections. Lochiel remains on the market. A feasibility study for its reuse commissioned on behalf of the Queensland Heritage Council in 1998 has identified several potential uses.In 2001, Michelle Kleist restored the mansion in 2001 but argued with the Queensland Heritage Council over a number of aspects of the restoration, including its colour. She followed the directions of the Council and later said she was happy with that outcome.In June 2006, the real estate information service RPD bought Lochiel for $6.4 million. In October 2010, the company and its founder Raymond David Catelan were fined $250,000 and $100,000 respectively for conducting unauthorised building work on Lochiel, involving the removal of walls and foundations and widening the cellar. == Description == Lochiel is a two-storeyed with basement timber structure with a masonry core and a corrugated iron gable roof. It is located on the northeastern corner of Toorak Road and Hillside Crescent, on the south facing slope of Toorak Hill overlooking the Hamilton Reach of the Brisbane River to the south. Lochiel has substantial gardens/plantings, and ancillary structures including garages (former stables), shed, and lych gate.Lochiel was constructed as a private residence and underwent two major extensions before its conversion into six flats. The earliest section of the building consisted of the existing masonry core, which comprises a south facing wing with basement rooms, and a wing at the rear forming an L-shaped plan. A large timber \"museum\" wing was added to the western end of the building forming a U-shaped plan. This wing is high-set with a recessed masonry enclosed room below. The rear wing was extended to the north and a second storey added, and later the courtyard space at the rear was enclosed. The building was subsequently converted into flats.The main entrance to Lochiel, when still a single residence, was from the south fronting Hillside Crescent. The southern elevation is high-set and consists of the \"museum\" wing at the western end, with an enclosed verandah with a corrugated iron skillion roof and brick piers which returns along the eastern side of the building.A wide entrance stair, with rendered masonry upstands to either side, is located centrally. Non-original timber framed French doors with obscured glass panes and sidelights are located at the top of the stair, the verandah has been enclosed with glass louvres and compressed sheeting, and latticed timber panels are located between the brick piers supporting the verandah. The eastern gable end of the roof has decorative timber bargeboards, and a deck opening from the first floor of the rear wing is located adjacent to the gable end and is supported by timber posts above the enclosed eastern verandah.The deck has cross-braced timber balustrades and a decorative porch/aedicule forming the entrance to the first floor. The porch/aedicule has paired timber posts with cross-bracing, latticed timber valance, louvred timber shutters above balustrade height, and decorative timber gable with battens and curved timber elements. The decorative southern gable of the first floor is located above the porch/aedicule, and has a battened timber screen with an arched central section and curved timber trim. A sash window with corrugated iron sunhood is located adjacent to the porch/aedicule.The two-storeyed rear wing is constructed of chamferboard, and overhangs the ground floor of the early rear wing on the eastern and northern sides and is supported by timber posts with curved brackets. The eastern elevation of the first floor has centrally located French doors accessed via an external timber stair, and flanked by sash windows with timber shutters to either side. A continuous corrugated iron sunhood supported by curved timber brackets shades the first floor windows and doors. The northern elevation has a large L-shaped timber stair, which bridges a driveway, accessing a central first floor porch. The porch has paired timber posts with cross-bracing, cross-braced balustrades, and non-original French doors with obscured glass panes. The porch is flanked by sash windows, and a continuous corrugated iron sunhood supported by curved timber brackets shades the windows and porch. The stair has a stepped battened timber balustrade, and the southern gable has a battened timber screen with an arched central section at the base.The western elevation of the first floor has sash windows with timber shutters flanking a smaller non-original casement window. A continuous corrugated iron sunhood supported by curved timber brackets shades these windows.The northern rear side of Lochiel consists of the enclosed courtyard flanked by the two-storeyed rear wing to the east, and the \"museum\" wing to the west. The enclosed courtyard has a corrugated iron skillion roof supported by timber posts, with louvred glass panels and compressed sheeting forming the exterior wall. A recessed entrance is located centrally, with multi-paned bifolding timber doors. A rendered masonry chimney is located at the rear of the original section of the building adjacent to the enclosed courtyard.The \"museum\" wing is constructed of chamferboard and has a corrugated iron gable roof and is supported by brick piers with latticed timber infill panels. The southern elevation is highly decorative, with a central bay window flanked by non-original casement windows (with a corner window unit to the southwest corner) and surmounted by timber detailing to the gable. The bay has narrow sash windows with etched and coloured glass panes and timber shutters. The bay is crowned by a timber valance consisting of triple curved sections, and paired lancet windows with leadlight panels are located in the gable above. The gable has a metal finial, and a battened timber screen with an arched central section and curved timber trim supported by curved timber brackets. A non original door is located on the eastern side of the bay and is accessed via a timber stair.The rear elevation of the \"museum\" wing has a metal finial and a battened timber screen to the gable, similar to the front elevation however without any of the decorative timber detailing and trim. Paired lancet windows with leadlight panels are located in the gable above a lean-to addition, which consists of an early section at the western end (possibly part of the original \"museum\" wing), and later enclosures at the eastern end. The lean-to has louvred glass windows as well as a row of fixed glass high level windows.An entrance to the rear lean-to, with a corrugated iron hood with curved timber brackets, is located on the western side. A porch with decorative timber detailing protects a second entrance located mid-way along the western elevation (this entrance was possibly originally a bay window). The porch has a gable roof with latticed timber gable panel and balustrade, curved valance and paired timber posts with cross-bracing. A continuous window hood surmounts several non-original casement windows, and two dormer windows with arched leadlight panels are located on the western side of the roof.An internal lightwell, created during the conversion of the building to flats, is located on the eastern side of the \"museum\" wing.Internally, the earliest section of the building is of rendered masonry construction and comprises two large rooms either side of a wide central hall fronting the southern verandah. Both rooms have wide timber architraves and skirtings, French doors opening to the verandah, a panelled timber door with deep reveals opening into the central hall, and a fireplace with marble surround flanked by narrow windows (now closed over but originally opened to the rear courtyard) either side. The western room has an infilled opening on the western side and a coffered ceiling with timber beams and cornice, and the eastern room has a plaster ceiling and cornice. The central hall has a plaster ceiling and cornice, and the end has been partitioned off to create a storage cupboard and the original opening to the rear has been infilled, but its form is still visible from the rear. The enclosed verandah has a raked boarded ceiling, and the western end has been partitioned off with French doors accessing a bathroom with terrazzo floor. The enclosed eastern verandah houses a kitchen area at the northern end.Internally, the rear wing is also of rendered masonry construction and comprises two large rooms with plaster ceilings and cornices, and deep timber skirtings and a timber fireplace surround to the central room. Both rooms have non-original multi-paned doors opening onto the enclosed verandah/undercroft space of the two-storeyed rear wing. The northern end of this space houses a bathroom, and the northern end of the masonry rear wing has been extended with the addition of a kitchen (possibly a free-standing structure added prior to the construction of the second storey). This kitchen structure has a raked ceiling on either side to the underside of the collar-beam, two small centrally pivoted windows which open against the rear of the end wall of the masonry wing, and a door and sash window opening to the rear.The enclosed courtyard has been partitioned into several rooms, and has raked boarded ceilings and timber floors. The posts supporting the skillion roof have chamfered corners and are set back in line with the rear of the \"museum\" wing.Internally, the \"museum\" wing currently houses two flats, but originally consisted of predominantly one large room with exposed tie-beams and hammer-posts with decorative curved timber brackets and raked boarded ceiling. A non-original ceiling has been installed to the underside of the tie-beams, and the space above, which is lit by the leadlight gable and dormer windows, remains intact with evidence of the original location of exhibits being visible. The original timber floor, consisting of alternately dark and light timber boards giving a striped appearance remains intact.The \"museum\" has been partitioned into several rooms, with plaster ceilings and cornices, timber architraves and skirtings, and casement windows. A boarded ceiling with deep cornices and high level windows is located in the rear northeast room, which is the location of the maid\\'s dining room and scullery prior to the building\\'s conversion into flats. The rear room (within the lean-to) has boarded walls and raked ceiling, and was used as a work room at the rear of the museum prior to the conversion into flats. A lightwell has been inserted into the eastern side of the \"museum\" wing adjacent to the early section of the structure (in place of the original openings into the museum from the former dining room and courtyard), and provides light and ventilation to internal rooms adjacent.The basement of the early masonry core is constructed of painted stone with brick quoining, and comprises two large rooms either side of a narrow central room. The floor of the western room is below the adjacent ground level, and a doorway to the west is accessed via stone steps. A barred window with arched header opens to the south below the verandah, and a fireplace is located against the northern wall with a narrow window adjacent. The narrow central room opens off the western room via an adjoining doorway, and has a barred window with arched header to the south. The floor of the eastern room is at the adjacent ground level, and the room is accessed via a low opening to the east, with a window with arched header to the south. A flight of stone steps is located against the northern wall at the rear of the western room, and leads to the underside of the enclosed courtyard floor.A masonry room is located below the \"museum\" wing. This room is constructed of mostly unpainted brickwork, with some rendered brickwork at the front, and has tall sash windows opening to the surrounding below floor space. The room is accessed via a door in the eastern wall (adjacent to the door accessing the basement of the early masonry core) and a door in the western wall fronting the adjacent garden. A concrete path with brick retaining wall wraps around the rear of this room with a gate accessing the adjacent garden. Internally, this room has a ripple-iron ceiling and timber architraves.Lochiel has extensive gardens, particularly to the southern part of the property. A decorative lych gate is located at the southeast of the garden, on the corner of Toorak Road and Hillside Crescent. The lych gate has brick piers surmounting rendered retaining walls either side of a flight of concrete steps. The piers support a decorative hipped gable shingle roof, which has terracotta finials at the corners, and curved projecting rafters with shaped ends. Steel gates with a concave top edge are fixed to the garden side of the lych gate. The gates access a gravel path which leads to the southern entrance to Lochiel. Both Toorak Road and Hillside Crescent frontages have rendered brick retaining walls/fences, with a driveway gate at the northern end of the property.The gravel path from the lych gate leads to a circular area with a central tree. From this area, a set of concrete steps accesses a path/terrace surmounting an embankment, with a second set of concrete steps leading to the southern entrance to Lochiel. The circular area has a stone threshold and stone pillar, and the gravel path has stone edgings and stone garden features.The southwest section of the garden consists of a grove of mature trees with a wide terrace below a dry-stone embankment. A masonry retaining wall separates this area from a raised lawn and garden on the western side of the structure. The southeast section of the garden has an open lawn bordered by mature trees and shrubs. A masonry retaining wall separates this area from a raised lawn and garden on the eastern side of Lochiel.A storage shed is located to the east of Lochiel at the northern end of the lawn. The shed has a gable roof with ribbed pan and corrugated iron sheeting and chamferboard walls. The southern gable has decorative timber bargeboards surmounting a gabled porch with latticed timber gable panel and decorative timber detailing. Lean-to structures have been added to the sides and rear of this building.The rear of the property comprises an area of lawn with stone retaining walls to the rear boundary. Garages are located at the northwest corner of the property. The garages have a corrugated iron skillion roof supported by timber posts, with a weatherboard wall at the eastern end and timber garage doors. The garages contain part of the squared rubble-coursed sandstone structure of the original stables. The sandstone forms the rear wall of the structure, with three transverse wall sections, and the western end wall has a raked parapet. Brickwork surmounts the rear sandstone wall forming a parapet, and an early set of steps is located adjacent to the western end wall. The floor of the garage is concrete. == Heritage listing == Lochiel was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 May 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland\\'s history. Arguably unique and indeed highly idiosyncratic Lochiel comprises a substantial house, outbuildings, and large established garden situated on the lower slopes of Toorak Hill overlooking the Brisbane River. It is a rare, intact, and fine example of a suburban estate; its evolution over several stages (the earliest believed to date from the 1860s) well illustrating the development of Brisbane and one of its earliest suburbs, Hamilton.The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland\\'s cultural heritage. Arguably unique and indeed highly idiosyncratic Lochiel comprises a substantial house, outbuildings, and large established garden situated on the lower slopes of Toorak Hill overlooking the Brisbane River. It is a rare, intact, and fine example of a suburban estate; its evolution over several stages (the earliest believed to date from the 1860s) well illustrating the development of Brisbane and one of its earliest suburbs, Hamilton. The early masonry core of the house, with surviving lower service area, is both a fine and rare surviving example of its type. The more idiosyncratic nature of Lochiel is more particularly found however in the form, placement, and exuberant detailing of the substantial timber additions (museum c. 1906 and upper eastern wing by 1927) and in the very building of the museum room as a purpose built private exhibition space. The garden including structural elements (such as paths, steps, walls, and decorative features) and mature plantings is also considered a rare and intact example of a pre World War II garden.The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland\\'s history. An investigation of the fabric of the house and garden and the publication of information believed held by the Cameron family have the potential to substantially contribute to the further understanding of the history of Lochiel.The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.

Bonanza then merged with Pacific Air Lines and West Coast Airlines to form Air West which in 1968 was continuing to serve Page with daily direct F-27 flights to Phoenix via stops at the Grand Canyon airport and Prescott as well as direct to Salt Lake City via Cedar City. Air West then changed its name to Hughes Airwest which in 1972 was operating daily direct F-27 service to Las Vegas via Grand Canyon airport and also direct to Salt Lake City via Cedar City on a daily basis. By 1975, Hughes Airwest had introduced direct F-27 service on the weekdays to Los Angeles International Airport via stops at Grand Canyon, Las Vegas and Palm Springs as well as continuing to operate direct service to Salt Lake City via Cedar City. In 1977, Hughes Airwest was flying non-stop F-27 service to Phoenix on a weekday basis in addition to the direct flight to Salt Lake City via Cedar City and had turned over the Las Vegas service to SkyWest Airlines which was operating Piper Navajo twin prop aircraft on the route with non-stop flights. Hughes Airwest then discontinued all service into the airport and was no longer serving Page by 1980.Following the cessation of service by Hughes Airwest, SkyWest Airlines, operating as an independent commuter air carrier, was providing non-stop service with Piper Navajo prop aircraft to Las Vegas and Phoenix. Scenic Airlines also flew nonstop service to Las Vegas on a seasonal basis during the late 1970s. By June 1, 1986, SkyWest was operating all service into Page as Western Express via a code sharing agreement with Western Airlines flying 19-passenger Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner propjets direct to Phoenix via a stop in Flagstaff and also non-stop to St. George, Utah. Following the acquisition of Western by Delta Air Lines on April 1, 1987, SkyWest began serving Page as a Delta Connection air carrier via a code sharing agreement with Delta with Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner propjets flying the same routes previously operated as Western Express. By 1995, SkyWest operating as the Delta Connection was operating three roundtrip non-stop flights a day with Metroliner aircraft between Page and Phoenix. In 1996 Great Lakes Airlines began serving the Page–Phoenix route with 19-seat Beechcraft 1900 commuter turboprops. The following year Scenic Airlines began serving Page once again and was flying the Page–Phoenix route with Cessna and Beechcraft 1900 aircraft. In 1998, Scenic was serving Page via a code sharing agreement with Delta Air Lines. In 1999 Sunrise Airlines took over the service flying three roundtrip non-stops a day between Page and Phoenix as an independent commuter air carrier with Piper Navajo aircraft. Great Lakes returned to Page in 2001, first operating flights to Phoenix as United Express on behalf of United Airlines via a code sharing agreement but then reverted to the independent Great Lakes banner the following year. Since then additional flights were operated at times to Denver, Las Vegas, and Farmington, NM before Great Lakes ceased all service and went out of business on March 26, 2018.

              " 'Charles Joseph Panarella a.k.a. \"Charlie Moose\" a.k.a. \"Len Conforti\" a.k.a. \"Chas Esposito\" (January 5, 1925 – July 18, 2017) was a New York City mobster and capo in the Colombo crime family with a brutal reputation as a hitman. == Early years == Charles was born in 1925 in Brooklyn, New York. He is also known to use January 5, 1922 as his birth date. He has used the aliases Charles Panarello, Chas Esposito, John Garguilo, Joseph Charles Panarella and Charles \"Moose\" Panarella. He stood at 6 ft (1.8 m) tall, had brown eyes and a scar on his bottom lip. In 1940, Panarella was arrested for the first time. His criminal record includes assault, burglary, extortion and possession of a loaded firearm.On August 11, 1972, Albert Gallo, brother of the late rogue Profaci crime family capo Crazy Joe Gallo (killed on April 7, 1972), had pinpointed Joseph (The Yack) Yacovelli, Alphonse (Allie the Snake) Persico Sr., Gennaro Langella and at least one other Colombo hood (thought to be Panarella) at the bar of the Neapolitan Noodle located at 320 East 79th Street in Midtown Manhattan. Minutes before the hit men arrived, however, the mobsters had moved to another table. In their place were five meat dealers from Chicago with their wives celebrating the engagement of one of their daughters to the restaurant\\'s manager. As this party moved to a table, led by the wives, the shooter, dressed in casual clothes and wearing dark glasses and a long black shoulder length wig, opened up with two guns killing Sheldon Epstein and Max Tekelch and wounding two other men. The killer escaped and was never found. The public outrage was led by New York City Mayor John V. Lindsay, who promised in running the gangsters out of town. Panarella was unharmed. Panarella once allegedly forced a man to eat his own testicles before killing him. Panarella has survived several feuds within the Colombo family that killed more than 100 people. While in New York, Panarella had a large profitable crew that included Gregory Scarpa Sr. The crew trafficked in narcotics, robbed banks, and controlled sheet metal and restaurant unions. == Exile to Las Vegas == In the mid-1980s, Panarella\\'s crew complained to Colombo boss Carmine Persico that Panarella was an abusive capo, however, the complainants were just fearful of Charlie Moose who was from the old school and didn\\'t put up with people in the crew who tried to avoid kicking up. His crew included some of the biggest killers in the family who were more than willing to put in any work that was passed down through Moose from the imprisoned Persico. Facing federal indictment, Persico feared that Panarella and caporegime John \"Sonny\" Franzese might use his legal troubles to move against him. When Panarella\\'s crew continued to complain that Moose was too demanding it gave Persico an excuse to exile Panarella to Las Vegas. Of all the people in his family, Persico feared Moose the most, then Sonny. It was legendary that Charlie had tortured and killed powerful Capo Dominic \"Mimi\" Scialo as a favor to Carlo Gambino after Scialo mocked Gambino to his face at Gargiulo\\'s Restaurant in Coney Island. Panarella would not forget this slight from Persico sending him to Vegas after being called upon by Persico dozens of times to kill for even the slightest of reasons even returning from Vegas occasionally to put work in that was ordered by his boss. In 1991, he actively sided with Victor Orena against Persico during Orena\\'s failed effort to take over the Colombo family but nobody, not even Greg Scarpa Sr. would try to kill the wily Moose. Panarella although siding with Orena mostly stayed out of the 3rd Colombo war but was called upon to kill an associate James \"Jimmy Beans\" Brunetto after Brunetto was found to have molested a 9-year-old boy in the back of R and J Health Studio a gym on Ave U. The boy was the grandson of Little Vic. Brunetto was kidnapped by a group of men after he left a bowling alley in the Mill Basin section of Brooklyn and his body has never been recovered. It is rumored that Brunetto was taken to a Sheepshead Bay Garage and that he had his penis removed and shoved up his rectum. He was supposed to be left that way on a street as a warning but because there had been a possible witness to the abduction they melted his body by acid in a 55-gallon drum, filled it with cement, and dropped it into Mill Basin from the Palone Boatyard on Ave U and East 67 Street. In 1994, Panarella was convicted of attempting to launder money through the Maxim Casino (now called the Westin Las Vegas) in Las Vegas as part of a scheme to purchase a farm for $500,000 to $1 million. Panarella had drug profits deposited at a cashier\\'s cage at the casino. In August 1994, Panarella pleaded guilty to conspiracy and served 15 months of an 18-month sentence. In September 1996, Panarella was released from prison. == Back to New York == Although living in Las Vegas, Panarella still kept some responsibilities back East. For a period of time, he was shuttling back to Brooklyn to oversee the Colombo family\\'s interests in Locals 14 and 15 of the International Union of Operating Engineers. In the summer of 2001, Panarella met in New York with Genovese family representatives over a dispute in Brooklyn. The Genovese family controlled most of the so-called \"no-show\" construction jobs in Brooklyn and the Colombo family wanted their fair share of them. Unfortunately for Panarella, the meeting location was bugged and law enforcement picked up clear evidence that he was acting as a member of the Colombo family. On December 4, 2003, Panarella was indicted in New York on a federal racketeering charge in connection with alleged labor law violations and construction payoffs. The charges were linked to alleged payoffs within Locals 14 and 15 of the International Union of Operating Engineers and to fraud in the construction of Richmond County Bank Ballpark, home of the Staten Island Yankees baseball team, and in construction of the Brooklyn General Post Office.In February 2008, Panarella was living under house arrest at his home in Kunkletown, Pennsylvania. The trial based on his 2005 racketeering indictment had been delayed due to Panarella\\'s ill health and psychological problems.In December 2012, a federal judge granted Panarella permission to travel to Long Island City, Queens in April 2013 to receive an award from his former union. It was reported that Panarella was confined to a motorized scooter and depended on portable oxygen.

              " \"Keith Victor Holman, MBE (11 September 1927 – 11 October 2011) was an Australian Rugby League footballer, a national and state representative Halfback whose club career was played with Western Suburbs from 1949 to 1961. He has since been named as one of the nation's finest footballers of the 20th century. After retiring as player, Holman was coach of Wests and later became one of the game's top-level referees. He was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1977. == Background == Holman was born in Ballarat, Australia. == Early years and war service == Holman had an impoverished childhood during the Great Depression. In his earliest years he was raised in a shanty at Yarra Bay in Sydney by a man named Holman who may have been his father. He was taken in by a local family named Schofield who enabled him to be schooled by the De La Salle Brothers at Surry Hills. There he met and befriended Bernie Purcell whom he would later play against and alongside in state and Kangaroo touring sides.Toward the end of the Second World War Holman joined the RAAF as a Leading Aircraftman. He was a chef with 82 Wing, 23 Squadron and was posted to bases in Ipswich, Queensland and later after the Japanese surrender, at Morakai and Balikpapan in Borneo. The Squadron flew B-24 Liberators in a transport role, flying ex-Prisoners of War and other Australian personnel back to Australia. == Club career == After the war he trialled for a contract with South Sydney but was turned away due to his small stature. An approach to Manly was also unsuccessful so he headed to Dubbo and befriended former Wests Five-eighth Eric Bennett. With Bennett's help, he landed a contract with the Magpies in 1948 and quickly rose through the ranks, playing with the Magpies until 1961. In thirteen seasons at Wests he never played in a premiership-winning team at club level. He missed Wests' premiership victory in 1952 because he was selected for that year's Kangaroo tour. He was captain-coach at Wests for seasons 1954 and 1955. == Representative career == Holman started his representative career with selection for New South Wales in 1950 and continued to represent the Blues until 1958. Also in 1950, Holman made his test debut for Australia, figuring prominently in Australia's first Ashes conquest in 30 years. He was selected to represent Sydney against France during their 1951 tour of Australasia in a match that ended in a 19-all draw. He made both the 1952 Kangaroo tour (5 Tests and 5 tour matches) and the 1956–57 tour (all 6 Tests plus 11 tour matches). Holman was the Australian selectors preferred halfback choice and regular in Test sides and World Cup squads from 1950 to 1958. By the end of his representative career he had amassed the then record of 32 Tests and a then record of 14 Anglo-Australian international appearances, beating Clive Churchill and Sandy Pearce. He made 12 Test appearances against France and 6 appearances against New Zealand. He was named New South Wales Player of the Year three times – 1951, 1956 and 1958. == Referee & coach == When his playing days were over he turned to refereeing. In a 1971 game between Queensland and New South Wales, Holman sent off three players. Holman controlled the 1971 Grand Final and went on to referee the Tests of New Zealand's tour of Australia in 1972. He was consistent first grade referee in 155 games from 1965 till 1974. He coached a Port Kembla side in 1975 and 1976 and then Western Suburbs in the NSWRFL. His final year active year in rugby league was 1977 when he coached his beloved Wests to victory in the 1977 Amco Cup. == Accolades == He had the rare honour of being made a life member of Western Suburbs while still playing. Keith Holman was awarded Life Membership of the New South Wales Rugby League in 1983.He was later selected in the Wests Tigers Team of the Century and the Western Suburbs Magpies Team of the Century. In 2003 he was admitted into the Australian Rugby League Hall of Fame.In 2007 Holman was selected by a panel of experts at halfback in an Australian 'Team of the 50s'.In February 2008, Holman was named in the list of Australia's 100 Greatest Players (1908–2007) which was commissioned by the NRL and ARL to celebrate the code's centenary year in Australia. Also in 2008 the Western Suburbs Magpies celebrated their centenary by inducting six inaugural members into the club's Hall of Fame. These six included Holman. == Footnotes == == References == Whiticker, Alan & Collis, Ian (2006) The History of Rugby League Clubs, New Holland, Sydney Whiticker, Alan & Hudson, Glen (2006) The Encyclopedia of Rugby League Players, Gavin Allen Publishing, Sydney Andrews, Malcolm (2006) The ABC of Rugby League Austn Broadcasting Corpn, Sydney Haddan, Steve (2007) The Finals – 100 Years of National Rugby League Finals, Steve Haddan Publishing, Brisbane Heads, Ian and Middleton, David (2008) A Centenary of Rugby League, MacMillan Sydney == External links == Keith Holman at the Sport Australia Hall of Fame (archive) Keith Holman at eraofthebiff.com 1980 Holman Interview at eraofthebiff.com Keith Holman at yesterdayshero.com.au\",\n",

              " 'The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia is a 1976 book by James C. Scott on the nature of subsistence ethics in peasant cultures. He asserts that peasants prefer the stability of state or landlord protection of minimal subsistence over the risky instability of self-subsistence, producing a feudal moral economy. Where colonialism and introductions of market economies interfere with this arrangement, peasants will rebel, separate from concerns about fluctuating quality of life. Scott cites three 1930s rebellions as examples: Cochinchina, the Burmese Saya San Rebellion, and the Vietnamese Nghệ-Tĩnh Soviets. == Bibliography == == External links == Official website',\n",

              " \"The St. Pancras Power Stations were two electricity generating stations, also known as the Regent’s Park Power Station and the King’s Road Power Station, which supplied electricity to the district of St. Pancras in north London from 1891 to 1968. == History == The Vestry of St. Pancras was the first London local authority to apply to provide an electricity supply. This was authorised by the St. Pancras (Middlesex) Electric Lighting Order 1883 which allowed the Vestry to generate and supply electricity to the district. However, no construction work was undertaken: but the authorisation prevented any competing company undertakings from supplying electricity to the area. == Regent’s Park Power Station == Work started in 1890 to build a power station east of Regent's Park on a site bounded by Stanhope Street, Longford Street and Wybert Street (TQ 290 824). The site, which then comprised residential buildings, was purchased for £10,827. The power station was known both as St. Pancras Power Station and Regent’s Park Power Station. The engine room was 106 ft by 26 ft (32.3 m by 7.9 m), the boiler house was west of the engine room and included a 90 ft (27.4 m) high brick chimney 5 ft (1.5 m) square. The principal equipment comprised: five Babcock & Wilcox boilers producing 5,000 lb/hr (0.63 kg/s) of steam at 70 psi (4.83 bar), nine triple expansion Willans-Robinson engines coupled to Kapp dynamos delivering 680 Amps at 112–130 Volts, two Willans engines driving a pair of dynamos delivering 90 Amps at 540–575 Volts for arc lights, jet condensers and a 170,000 gallon (773 m3) underground water tank, banks of batteries to equalise the voltage, the battery house was north east of the engine room.The station started generating electricity in November 1891. It was designed to supply 10,000 incandescent lamps and 90 arc lights for street lighting, with a total capacity of about 1,000 kW. Within six months of opening the load on the station was at capacity. In 1893 the Vestry installed three further boilers and three 90 kW generators which completed the station.In 1897 the plant generated 1847.18 MWh; 1342.54 MWh was sold to customers and 177.815 MWh for public, this provided an income to the corporation of £33,347-9-11. The growth of electricity supplies is illustrated in the table. In 1923 the DC generating plant was located at the Regent’s Park site and comprised 4 × 0.5 MW reciprocating generators providing a 220 / 440 DC supply. The boilers at Regent’s Park had a total evaporative capacity of 60,000 lb/hr (7.56 kg/s).The power station at Stanhope Street operated for 34 years and was closed in 1925 and all electricity generation for the Borough was undertaken at King’s Road. The area has been extensively redeveloped and there is no material evidence of the Regent’s Park power station. Some original lamp posts are extant in Tottenham Court Road, fitted with modern lamps. == King’s Road Power Station == The St. Pancras district extended over an area of 2,694 acres (1,090 ha). In 1893 the Vestry started construction of a second power station to provide electricity supplies to the north of the district. It was located on a site bounded by King’s Road, Pratt Street, Georgiana Street and Great College Street (TQ 293 839), when purchased the site was occupied by industrial buildings. The new station, also known as St. Pancras Power Station or King’s Road Power Station, was designed to burn domestic and commercial refuse as well as coal. It was commissioned in late 1895 and initially had: three ‘Lancashire’ type boilers with an evaporative capacity of 5,500 to 7,000 lb/hr (0.7–0.88 kg/s) and working at a pressure of 125 psi (8.6 bar), three Belliss engines developing 200 BHP (150 kW) at 350 RPM, each was connected to two 65 kW dynamos, provision for a further two engine/dynamo sets to be added.Condensing of steam was done using water abstracted from the nearby Regent’s Canal. There were operational problems with the refuse destructor which provided insufficient heat to raise steam in the quantities required. The destructor only handled a small proportion of the waste produced in the area and after several modifications the refuse facility was abolished in 1920, after which the boilers were coal fired. In 1913/14 a Brush-Ljungstrom turbo-generator set was installed. In 1923 the AC generating plant was located at the King’s Road site and comprised 1 × 1.5 MW, 1 × 2 MW, 2 × 3 MW and 1 × 5.6 MW turbo-generators. The boilers at King’s Road had a total evaporative capacity of 185,000 lb/hr (23.31 kg/s). Then in 1927 a 10 MW Brush-Ljungstrom turbo-generator set was added.In the early 1960s the plant at King’s Road comprised a mixture of chain grate stoker, pulverised coal, oil-fired plant and internal combustion engine prime movers. The boilers were capable of delivering 220,000 lb/hr (27.7 kg/s) of steam at 200 psi (13.8 bar) and 482/316/343 °C. The coal-fired plant was taken out of service, and during the final 3 years of operation only the oil-fired plant was used, but with a low load factor (see table). The King’s Road power station was decommissioned in 1968 after a working life of 73 years. The site is now (2020) the St. Pancras Georgiana Street sub-station. == Legislative impact == The London Government Act 1899 abolished the Vestry of St. Pancras and established St. Pancras Metropolitan Borough Council from November 1900. The Borough’s Electricity and Public Lighting Committee assumed responsibility for the power stations and the electricity distribution system.The Electricity (Supply) Act 1926 established Central Electricity Board (CEB) which was responsible for directing the operation of power stations including St. Pancras Power Stations. The CEB was also responsible for constructing the national grid which provided interconnections between electricity systems like St. Pancras, thereby enabled to import and export electricity in bulk. For example, from 1927 St. Pancras became an authorised distributor providing a supply in bulk to Islington Metropolitan Borough Council; in 1931 it supplied 38.509 MWh. It also supplied electricity to the County of London Electric Supply Company delivering 14 MWh in 1935 and 1936.Upon nationalisation of the British electricity supply industry in 1948 under the Electricity Act 1947 the ownership of King’s Road Power Station was vested in the British Electricity Authority, and then to the Central Electricity Authority, and finally to the Central Electricity Generating Board. The low voltage distribution network and sales of electricity was the responsibility of the London Electricity Board which bought electricity in bulk from the British Electricity Authority, etc. == Operational data == A summary of the operational data for the St. Pancras power stations and their associated electricity system over the working life is shown in the following table. There were two sub-stations on the St. Pancras system: at Tavistock Place and Highgate Road. The number of electricity customers in the Borough increased steadily. In 1903 there were 2,280, this increased to 5,034 in 1919, to 9,277 in 1924, and 44,161 in 1938. Until after 1920 St. Pancras power stations supplied only Direct Current to customers at 220 V and 440 V. In the year ending 31 March 1904 electricity was being sold to private consumers at 3.96 d./kWh and public lighting was charged at 2.44 d./kWh. In 1938 electricity for lighting was being charged at 2.75 d./kWh, at 0.5 d./kWh for heating and cooking, and 0.75 d./kWh for power. The Borough took a supply of electricity from the London, Midland and Scottish Railway Company at Kentish Town: 1.376 GWh in the year 1923/4 at a cost of £5,446; this arrangement continued into the 1930s. In 1922 a total of 13,558 MWh electricity was sold (16,218 MWh in 1923) this raised a total revenue of £241,623 in 1922 and £220,127 in 1923. The financial profits and losses from the supply of electricity in the Borough of St. Pancras were as follows.The income from the electricity undertaking enabled the Borough to reduce the rates (local taxes). For example, in 1921/2 from the profit of £23,129 made, £16,132 was transferred for the relief of local rates.By the late 1950s the plant comprised one 15 MW, one 12.5 MW, two 7 MW and two 3 MW Brush-Ljungstrom turbo-alternators all generating at 5.2 kV. == Culture == King’s Road power station was used as a set in the 1965 film Operation Crossbow where it represented a WW2 rocket factory. == References ==\",\n",

              " 'American Indian Stories is a collection of childhood stories, allegorical fictions and essays written by Sioux writer and activist Zitkala-Ša.First published in 1921, American Indian Stories details the hardships encountered by Zitkala-Ša and other Native Americans in the missionary and manual labour schools. The autobiographical details contrast her early life on the Yankton Indian Reservation and her time as a student at White\\'s Manual Labour Institute and Earlham College. The collection includes legends and stories from Sioux oral tradition, along with an essay titled America\\'s Indian Problem, which advocates for rights for Native Americans and calls for a greater understanding of Native American cultures. American Indian Stories offers a unique view into a society that is often overlooked though that society still persists to this day. == Book contents == === Impressions of an Indian Childhood. === ==== My Mother ==== The story begins with a description of the big path that leads from Zitkala-Sa\\'s childhood wigwam to a river which, in turn, makes its way to \"The Edge of Missouri\". Her mother would draw water from this river for household use. Zitkala-Sa would play at her mother\\'s side, noting that she was often sad and silent. At the age of seven, Zitkala-Sa describes herself as \\'wild\\' and \\'as free as the wind that blew her hair\\'. Recounting a conversation with her mother on one of their return trips from the river, Zitkala-Sa told her that when she is older like her 17-year-old cousin Warca-Ziwin, she will come and get water for her. Zitkala-Sa\\'s mother responded, \"If the paleface does not take away from us the river we drink\". Young Zitkala-Sa inquires about the palefaces, to which her mother responds, \"My little daughter, she is a sham, a sickly sham!\". Zitkala-Sa\\'s mother describes the palefaces as the cause of much sorrow for their people, who stole their land and caused the deaths of Zitkala-Sa\\'s cousin and uncle. ==== The Legends ==== Zitkala-Sa, as a \"participant and observer\", sketches the importance of the Legends of her people. In this story, Zitkala-Sa shares with the readers how, \"I loved best the evening meal, for that was the time old legends were told. I was always glad when the sun hung low in the west, for then my mother sent me to invite the neighboring old men and women to eat supper with us.\" Zitkala-Sa\\'s tribe had traditions for how and when to speak to elders, and especially how to listen to these legend stories. The atmosphere must be set, and in due time, the elders would tell the stories of their people, and pass on the Legends to the children of the tribe. Such as Zitkala-Sa was told these legends as a child, she \"attempted to preserve her people\\'s oral tradition by transcribing oral tales into written English, as well as transcribing her life\\'s story into autobiography.\"<Stanley, Sandra Kumamoto. Claiming a Native American Identity: Zitkala-Sa and Autobiographical Strategies. Pacific Coast Philology. 29/1 (September 1994) pages 64–69.> \"That Zitkala-Sa was independent enough to write about her \"varying moods\" is a credit to her and a bonus for anyone interested in some of the impulses that launched an American Indian Literary tradition in English.\" ==== The Beadwork ==== The Beadwork is a descriptive story sharing the tradition of beadwork and its place in Zitkala-Sa\\'s tribe. This story is from the experiences of a young girl who is learning the process of beadwork from her mother. Even during this time, Zitkala-Sa shares the experience of childhood envy in regards to the artist products of the beadwork of her friends. The Native American traditional education of learning the trade of beadwork is described with Zitkala-Sa sharing her \"practical observation lessons in the art of beadwork.\" (Bonnin, 19) Zitkala-Sa ends this story with, \"That evening, as on other evenings, I went to sleep over my legends,\" (Bonnin, 24) which points to the Legends noted in her other story, The Legends, as well as the childhood dreams of a young girl in Native life. ==== The Coffee Making ==== In this story, Zitkala-Sa discusses the first time she ever made coffee. Her mother had left her home alone and she was fearful of a crazy man who used to wander into wigwams. Someone did enter her wigwam, but it was an old grandfather who tells her stories. She remembers that when they have guests over, her mother makes them coffee and offers them food. Trying to be a good hostess she goes to make the coffee, although she does not know how. She tries, but what she ends up giving her grandfather is a cold mug of dirty water. Her mother arrives and sees that she has tried to make coffee and her and the grandfather laughed and her mother made more coffee. Zitkala-Sa did not feel embarrassed and it was not until she was older that she realized what she did was ridiculous. ==== The Dead Man\\'s Plum Bush ==== In this story, Zitkala-Sa describes the day when strange people with painted faces come into her neighborhood to the new warrior Haraka Wambdi\\'s wigwam. The crowd sits in the grass surrounding a fire with venison being cooked in kettles hanging above it. They are celebrating Wambdi\\'s first battle by having a feast with the whole Indian village. Zitkala-Sa, still in her own wigwam, becomes restless seeing all of the guests heading over to the feast while she has to wait for her mother to finish cooking a duck. She asks her mother why she is cooking when they are about to go to a feast in which her mother replies that they are going to stop by an ill, elderly woman\\'s wigwam to feed her on the way to the feast. This causes Zitkala-Sa to feel ashamed to have forgotten about the woman. As they walked, Zitkala-Sa was about to pick some plums off a plum bush when her mother stops her. Her mother explains that there was a dead Indian warrior buried there, and when he was buried they put plum seeds in his hand because he died with plum seeds in his hand. From those seeds rose a bush. Since then, Zitkala-Sa was careful around the bush and always listening for the whistle of departed spirits. ==== The Ground Squirrel ==== In the fall, Zitkala-Sa\\'s aunt used to help her mother preserve foods for the winter. In the early mornings a misty smoke was visible above the marsh. Zitkala-Sa is afraid of this smoke and when it was visible, Zitkala-Sa never liked to go too far from her wigwam unless she was with her mother. Her mother and aunt would gather corn and Zitkala-Sa would have to watch it while it dried. Sometimes there was a little ground squirrel that would take some of the sweet corn. She wants to catch it but her mother fears that the ground squirrel might bite her fingers. After the corn was dried, her mother would start slicing pumpkins into thin rings and hang them in between a couple poles for them to dry. Her mother also dried berries, plums, and cherries. Out of everything that had happened when preserving things in the fall, she remembers the ground squirrel the most. Most of her memories from when she was a child were in the summer but she recalls a winter day when some missionaries gave her a bag of marbles. Some of the marbles were made of colored glass. She went walking down to the river one day with her mother where she saw big floating ice chunks. The light of the day had been reflecting colors in the ice and the colors reminded her of her marbles so she tried to pry the colors out of the ice. Her fingers got too cold for her to continue but from then on she thought marbles had river ice inside of them. ==== The Big Red Apples ==== Zitkala-Sa describes in this story about how she was 8 years old. She only was aware of her mother\\'s native language. This is when the paleface missionaries began to visit her village. These visiting white men were recruiting Indian children to go to Eastern schools. Zitkala-Sa\\'s mother was hesitant of these strangers, but the children of the tribe, including Zitkala-Sa, were curious of these visitors. Zitkala-Sa had a brother, Dawe\\'e who had gone with these missionaries to receive an Eastern education. The missionaries, thus, were curious about recruiting his sister, Zitkala-Sa, to also receive this education. Against her mother\\'s wishes, Zitkala-Sa desired to explore the beautiful East lands. Zitkala Sa\\'s mother understood the other children\\'s influence on Zitkala-Sa in regards to the \"white man\\'s lies.\" (Bonnin, 41) She tried to encourage her daughter not to go by saying, \"Don\\'t believe a word they say! Their words are sweet, but, my child, their deeds are bitter.\" (Bonnin, 41) Though Zitkala-Sa did not want to disrespect her mother\\'s wishes, she was told of \\'the great tree where grew red, red apples; and how we could reach out our hands and pick all the red apples we could eat.\" As a child of 8 years, she had never tasted many apples and was very excited to roam these fields of apples. She didn\\'t understand how her mother could be so negative towards these people. 8 year old Zitkala-Sa wanted apples, she wanted adventure. The interpreter for the missionaries assured the young girl and her mother, \"Yes, little girl, the nice red apples are for those who pick them; and you will have a ride on the iron horse if you go with these good people.\" (Bonnin, 42) The innocent naïve Zitkala-Sa was insistent to go to the wonderful Eastern land to experience the unknown education of the palefaces. The young Zitkala-Sa had no idea what her adventure would entail, leaving her mother for a future paleface education, while having natural instincts, \"I was as frightened and bewildered as the captured young of a wild creature.\" (Bonnin, 45) \"By using the apple as a symbol of the Western tradition, Zitkala-Sa subverts the idea that the missionaries were \"saving the Indians\"; instead, she enacts a reverse temptation wherein the missionaries tempt her with forbidden fruit, causing her to fall out of the coherent oral culture of her mother into the \"white man\\'s\" world of knowledge, a world too often promising her \"white men\\'s lies\"—knowledge as delusion.\" (Stanley, 66) === The School Days of an Indian Girl === ==== The Land of Red Apples ==== Zitkala-Sa and seven other Dakota children head East with the missionaries by choice. They are impatient to begin the journey to the \"Red Apple Country\" where they \"dream of roaming freely and happily\". They expect a great deal of enjoyment from their ride on the iron horse (train) but are disturbed and troubled by the staring palefaces. Zitkala-Sa resents being watched and notes the paleface mother does not reprimand her children for their \"rude curiosity\" and pointing, which makes her embarrassed and on the verge of tears.She remembers seeing a telegraph pole, which was being erected by palefaces in her home land. Her thoughts on the telegraph pole help her forget her surroundings, until a missionary calls her name and tosses candies to her and other children which amuses them. Though her trip on the iron horse lasts several days, Zitkala-Sa does not remember any luncheons.They reach the school grounds at night. Her body trembles with fear and she stays close to the wall upon entering. As she quietly plans an escape, a paleface woman picks her up and tosses her in the air excitedly. Young Zitkala-Sa is both \"frightened and insulted\", because her mother never treated her in such a way. The thought of her mother makes her cry aloud. The palefaces misunderstand her tears and sit her at a table with food. An older Dakota child tells her to hold her tears until she is alone at night. She pleads for her mother, brother and aunt.From the table, the children are taken upstairs to a room lined with narrow beds. Zitkala-Sa sleeps with a tall girl, because she speaks her native tongue which soothes her. Zitkala-Sa notes she has \"arrived in the wonderful land of rosy skies\", but she is not as happy as she wishes. Her tears are \"left to dry themselves in streaks\" because her mother and aunt are not there to wipe them away. ==== The Cutting of My Long Hair ==== In the vignette, \"The Cutting of my Long Hair\", Zitkala-Sa looks at the physical differences between herself and the \"palefaces\" running the school. In the beginning of the vignette she lines up with the other American Indian children. They are about to eat breakfast, but must first pray, a new concept for her.As everyone begins, Judéwin, a girl who knows little English, frightens young Zitkala-Sa by announcing a paleface woman will cut their hair. Zitkala-Sa feels uncomfortable and cries. She is aware of her new tight-fitting clothes and uncomfortable shoes, far different from her usual dress and moccasins. After eating and getting into line, she remembers her mother said how only cowards have their hair cut from them, so she quietly slips away.Finding refuge in a dark room, Zitkala-Sa hides under a bed but soon hears voices calling her name. The women find her and she starts crying, fearful of what will happen next. They strap the frightened girl down and after feeling the cold blade on her neck they slice off her long beautiful hair. The young girl cries for her mother, but soon remembers she is not there to comfort her. ==== The Snow Episode ==== One day while playing in snowdrifts, Zitkala-Sa and her friends were told not to fall face first into the snow. Forgetting their orders, they continued to do it when a woman yelled at them from the school and told them to come inside. Judewin, the only one of the three girls who could speak English, told Zitkala-Sa and Thowin that when the \"pale face\" looks into their eyes and talks loudly they must wait until she stops and then say the word \"no\". Thowin was called into the office first. The other two waited and listened outside of the door. After listening a bit, Judewin realized she taught the girls the wrong reply. They heard Thowin say no and then she was spanked. The woman asked Thowin again if she was going to obey her the next time and Thowin replied no. The woman continued to whip her until she asked Thowin if she was going to fall in the snow again. Thowin replied no and the woman then let her out of the office. Zitkala-Sa figured she must have realized this method was not working so she left the three in the room alone. These misunderstandings continued frequently for the next couple seasons. Zitkala-Sa learned some English and became mischievous. Once when she disregarded a rule she was sent to the kitchen to mash turnips. She hated the turnips and their smell so she smashed them in their jar to a pulp. She mashed them so hard that the bottom of the glass jar they were in broke. When someone came to stop her, they lifted the jar and the bottom and all of its contents spilled onto the floor. No turnips were served for dinner that night. ==== The Devil ==== In a second vignette, \"The Devil\", young Zitkala-Sa describes a new enemy. She was taught to fear no one but the palefaces show her a detailed picture of the Devil, with horns and a slithery tail, and the image frightens her deeply. The palefaces told her \"I torture little girls who disobey school regulations\".Zitkala-Sa then describes a dream where she sees her mother and an old woman in a cottage, when the Devil bursts in and chases her. She screams out but the old woman and her mother do not hear her screaming and ignore her. Later, Zitkala-Sa scribbles over the picture, leaving a hole where the image had been. ==== Iron Routine ==== Every morning in the winter the school children would be woken up at 6:30 by a loud bell. They only had a short while to get ready until it was time for roll call which was announced by a little bell. It did not matter if the children were sick or not, they had to be down for roll call or they would be marked tardy. Zitkala-Sa remembers the time when she was sick and did not want to come down for roll call but had to. There was a little girl who was also sick and dying and one of the school teachers sat by her bedside with a cool rag and put it on her hands and feet but it made no difference, the little girl died. Zitkala-Sa hated this time and everything about it. She hated the teachers who did not care when they were sick, she hated the medicine the teachers gave her, and she hated the pencils that moved across the paper that marked her tardy. When she would feel better, she forgot her hatred and began to smile again. But she still remembers these times the most. ==== Four Strange Summers ==== ==== Incurring My Mothers Displeasure ==== === An Indian Teacher among Indians === ==== My First Day ==== ==== A Trip Westward ==== ==== My Mother\\'s Curse Upon White Settlers ==== ==== Retrospection ==== === The Great Spirit === === The Soft-Hearted Sioux === ==== I-V ==== === The Trial Path === This section tells the story of the author\\'s grandparents, as told to her by her grandmother.

              " 'Pandit Rabin Ghosh (1932–2010), a 20th-century violin virtuoso of \\'Seni-Maihar\\' Gharana (Seni-Maihar School of thoughts) of North Indian Classical Music, India, was a disciple of Baba Ustad Allauddin Khan Saheb. He was noted for his unique style of playing \\'Ati-Vilambit\\' (very slow movement applicable to \\'Alap\\' and \\'Vilambit Gat\\' of a raga, a very prime feature to the Indian classical music) with an extensive use of \\'Micro-Tone\\' (application of \\'Shruti\\') to imitate the Indian Singing style. == Early life == Rabin Ghosh hailed from a family with a strong musical background. His father was an Engineer and played Flute and Esraj (an Indian string instrument). From a very early age, Rabin Ghosh was influenced by the musical atmosphere, which drove him into playing Esraj, Flute, and Tabla (an Indian percussion instrument). He finally focused on Violin, under the guidance of Mr. Mani Majumder, one of the renowned violinists of the contemporary time of Western Classical Music. After continuous training on Western Classical Music he shifted to North Indian Classical Music under the guidance of \\'Sangeetacharya\\' Haripada Chattopadhay, exponent violinist of \\'Dagar Gharana\\' (Dagar school of thoughts) of North Indian Classical Music. Rabin Ghosh continued his training more than a decade under the tutelage of Haripada Chattopadhay. During this time he not only won violin Competitions, also performed in concerts along with All India Radio, Calcutta. == Way to Maihar == In the year 1955, Rabin Ghosh got an opportunity to play violin before Baba Allauddin Khan Saheb (at the time of visiting Calcutta), the doyen of Hindustani Classical Music. He played Raga Mian ki Todi before him. Baba Allauddin Khan Saheb was satisfied to accept him as his disciple. In the mid of 1955, Rabin Ghosh left for Maihar. === Life at Maihar === Life at Maihar for Rabin Ghosh was very dedicated. Besides receiving training from Baba Allauddin Khan Saheb, he was appointed as a teacher of Maihar Government Music College. Rabin Ghosh had a very strict and long duration practice session which he maintained till the last day in Maihar. In his own words \"I used to light a thick fragrance stick and would continue practice till it burned out totally\". == Contribution == At that time, Rabin Ghosh\\'s practice sessions lasted about 12 hours a day but reached a peak of 14 to 16 hours a day. During his stay at Maihar over seven and half years, he experimented with different techniques on violin sound production and researched sitting posture which helped with the long duration of practice sessions. === Invention of 5th string on violin === During the years of rigorous training under the tutelage of Baba Alauddin Khan Saheb in Maihar, Rabin Ghosh was inspired to \\'Design and Develop Five-String Violin\\'. The need to access and explore the lower octave in expressing the mood of Raga RamDashi Malhar, in 1958, the young artist Rabin Ghosh, had an extensive experimentation, which augmented 4 string violin to 5 string violin without compromising the original tonal quality of conventional violin. For Five-String Violin he used to use 1st string \\'E’ as \\'Rishav\\' (higher octave), 2nd string \\'A’ as \\'Pancham\\' (middle octave), 3rd string \\'D’ as \\'Saraj\\' (middle octave), 4th string \\'G’ as \\'Madhyam\\' (lower octave), and 5th string \\'C’ as \\'Komol Nishad\\' (lower octave). From 1960, Rabin Ghosh used \\'Five String Violin\\' starting with his performances at Tansen Sangeet Sanmelan, Calcutta. ==== Resting violin on case ==== Rabin Ghosh\\'s playing style was enriched with the amalgamation of singing as well as tantrakari. He used to use extensive \\'Micro-Tone\\' (application of \\'Shruti\\') to imitate the Indian Singing style. Another distinct feature of his playing style was holding the violin. He used his \\'specially made violin case\\' for resting his violin. He realised that playing could be more comfortable if the instrument is held from the both end facilitating to play finest Meend (sliding), Gamak and other technical applications. Other aspect was to avoid the \\'Excessive Flexion\\' of the vertebral column of the performer, instead of resting violin somewhere of the body. ==== Introduction of Tala ==== Maestro Rabin Ghosh composed \\'Someswara Tala\\' imagining the dancing posture of Nataraj, of 11 Beats, having division of 3 – 2 – 3 – (1.5 + 1.5). == Composition == Going beyond the periphery of performing and teaching Maestro Rabin Ghosh has put his earnest endeavour to compose a few orchestrations on Indian Classical Music. During his tenure in Maihar, when he was completely engulfed in receiving training in Indian Classical Music from Baba Alauddin Khan Saheb, the motif kindled within his heart a unique feeling which prompted him to compose some pieces on Indian Classical Ragas completely orchestrated. The ragas in which he explored himself are Zila Kafi, Bhupali, Kirwani, Khamaj etc. His honest effort to con flux two parallel voices in a composition tuned out to be a grand success. Abhisarika, Niharika, Sanchari and more such compositions shaped between 1973 and 1992 and were staged by his disciples from time to time. A compact disc album named \\'Niharika\\' played by his disciples was released with orchestral works. == Recordings == From 1970 and 1972 The Gramophone Company of India Limited (HMV) released Three Long Playing Discs. The stereo recordings consists solo performance of Raga Pahari Jhinjhoti, Raga Ahir Bhairav by Rabin Ghosh, Raga Gunkali with Himangshu Biswas in Flute, Patdeep (Dhun). HMV released a disk consists of Raga Brindabani Sarang,Raga Bageshree by Rabin Ghosh with Himangshu Biswas (Flute), Dinesh ch. Chandra (Sitar) and Shyamal Bose (Tabla). === Publication === Maestro Rabin Ghosh published a book \\'Swarankan Sanghati\\' – integration of notation system, where he described and analysed the common features as well as comparison and method of translating music between Indian Classical Music Notation System and Western Classical Music Notation System. == Teaching career == Maestro Rabin Ghosh established a new dimension in the field of Indian Classical Music on Violin. As a result, he was associated with Ali Akbar College of Music, Calcutta, Tansen Music College as teacher of violin. Rabin Ghosh was associated with Rabindra Bharati University as lecturer of Instrumental Music Department. He held the position of Examiner for Vishwa Bharati University and for Prayag Sangit Samiti. Maestro Ghosh also gave many Lecture-Demonstrations in various places, including in the Department of Music of Emory University, and Sacramento state University, California, USA. == Awards and achievements == Awarded certificate for standing first in the Baranagar Music Competition on Indian Classical Music by the Baranagar Godhuli Sangha, Calcutta (presently Kolkata), West Bengal in 1946.

              " 'Thomas Goode snr. JP. (May 1816 – 25 October 1882) (Goode sounds like \\'good\\') was a South Australian merchant closely associated with the Murray River town of Goolwa. == History == Goode was born in the parish of Thornbury, Herefordshire, England, in May 1816. In 1851 he arrived in South Australia, and in 1852 pitched his tent in Goolwa and shortly afterwards built a wooden general store and dwelling house near where the police station later stood. In those days Goolwa was known as \"The Elbow\", and Port Elliot as \"The Knob\", and the few residents were located in huts, the day of houses not having arrived for a locality so far away from the metropolis.Goolwa was at the entrance through the Murray Mouth through which Captain Cadell\\'s steamer the Lady Augusta made its first trip up the river as far as Swan Hill with Governor Young and party, and from where William Randell in Mary Ann made the same trip with little fanfare. The River Murray Steam Navigation Company followed, the tramway to Port Elliot was constructed, and the famous attempt at a breakwater there, later abandoned. It became a major transport hub before the construction of the road network, particularly of wool and wheat. As Goolwa prospered his business grew with it, and necessitated the erection of commodious premises in Cadell Street. In 1873 he took over the business and stock of competitor Emanuel Cohen. Around 1880, with failing health, he gave up the business to his two sons, Thomas and Edward Goode, and retired to his residence \"Thornbury\", a short distance from the township. He suffered considerably before dying, and was buried in the Currency Creek cemetery. In March 1884 the shop was largely destroyed by fire, and was rebuilt within the old walls, which had survived largely intact.In 1952 Thomas Goode & Co. of Goolwa celebrated the 100th year of trading in Goolwa, for most of that time in the same premises, and at that time under the managership of Harold Goode. The shop was still standing in 2011, as a homewares and clothing store \"Chantillie Place\", owned by local resident Peter Smith. == Other interests == Mr Goode was chosen as Goolwa\\'s first mayor, and for a number of years filled the office of Justice of the Peace also. The Southern Agricultural Society many times re-elected him as its President, and he was frequently urged to accept nomination to the House of Assembly, but he always declined. He believed in the practicability of the Goolwa canal scheme (which would have cut a direct route from the town to the sea; a scheme for which a parliamentary Bill was passed but never implemented), and advocated its formation with great energy, gathering a great deal of information and making some valuable diagrams and models illustrating how it could be carried out.In those days of limited populations in country villages medical attendance was a scarce article, but fortunately for Goolwa Mr. Goode had considerable skill and knowledge in surgery and pharmacy (he was a member of the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain), and his advice and medicines were greatly valued, without fee or reward, as many owners of broken legs and arms could testify. == Family == A related Goode family came from Kyre Magna, Worcestershire: Thomas, Charles, Henry Abel, William and Benjamin Powell Goode on the Hope in 1858. William, B. P., H. A. Goode worked a shop at Yankalilla Charles Rufus Goode came out in 1860, Another brother, Matthew arrived on the South Australian in 1868.

In 1901 he took up farming and grazing at Barooka station, Kingston where he took a keen interest in the South-Eastern drainage scheme, and many other activities in the district. He was chairman of the local drainage league, chairman of the Kingston school board for 20 years, chairman of the Kingston Agricultural Horticultural and Pastoral Society, and a member of the Lacepede District Council for 31 years.He married Alison Ross Johnston ( – 2 December 1923) on 26 February 1880. She was a daughter of Captain Thomas Johnston (who may have been a cousin of George Bain Johnston); his brother Tom (see above) married her sister Jane. Their children included Edward D. Goode and Thomas J. \"Tom\" Goode of Kingston, Alick Ferguson Goode (c. June 1889 – 20 September 1917) of Goolwa, who was killed in World War I, Elsie, May, Gladys and Kathleen \"Kath\" Goode, who married William P.

              " 'Tri-Valley Transit (formerly ACTR and Stagecoach) is the public transportation provider primarily serving Addison, Orange, and north Windsor Counties in central Vermont. Tri-Valley Transit\\'s mission is to enhance the economic, social and environmental health of the communities it serves by providing public transportation services that are safe, reliable, accessible and affordable. TVT became a 501(c)(3) incorporation in 2017 as the unification of Addison County Transit Resources (ACTR) of Addison County, Vermont, and Stagecoach Transportation Inc. (Stagecoach) of Orange and Northern Windsor Counties, Vermont. Stagecoach was founded in 1976 and ACTR in 1992 by community leaders who recognized that many residents were impeded by a lack of reliable transportation to work, medical appointments and essential errands. == History == In the early days, services focused on elderly residents and were provided by volunteers. Today TVT offers a robust public Shuttle Bus System for everyone and a complementary Dial-A-Ride System for vulnerable residents who cannot access the Bus System. Beginning in 2002, ACTR expanded its bus routes and Dial-A-Ride capacity, growing ridership from 68,000 to more than 174,000 in 2019 and its growth necessitated building the Addison County Community Transportation Center in order to meet future community transportation needs. Over the past two decades, TVT and ACTR have been recognized more than once nationally as a model rural system and locally for community impact. In 2014, ACTR was named the Chamber of Commerce Non-Profit of the Year, while in 2015, Executive Director Jim Moulton was named the nation’s Community Transportation Manager of the Year, and in 2016, Regional Director Bill Cunningham was named Addison County’s Person of the Year. In addition, the Community Transportation Center won awards in 2013 and 2017 for innovative green building design. Based on ACTR’s record of responsible and highly effective community service, the VT Agency of Transportation (VTrans) asked ACTR leadership to enter into a management agreement with Stagecoach in 2014. Stagecoach was in crisis – facing bankruptcy and potential closure. During the three-year management agreement with ACTR, Stagecoach’s debt was paid off, it regained its status as the regional Medicaid Non-Emergency Medical trip provider, general public services were expanded, and community impact nearly doubled (from 61,400 rides in 2014 to nearly 112,600 in 2019). ACTR also benefitted by gaining shared staff, operational efficiencies and cost savings, and a deeper organizational foundation. In 2017, with the management agreement set to expire, the two Boards of Directors recognized the two agencies were stronger together than apart and Tri-Valley Transit was born. With long histories behind them, however, both divisions continued to operate under their original local branding while slowly building the TVT brand. In 2020, TVT began developing a new, unified logo with plans to implement within 3-6 months. In 2019, TVT provided more than 268,000 rides and was on track to deliver approximately 300,000 in 2020 before the COVID-19 pandemic. == Services == Dial-A-Ride programs provide more than 119,000 annual rides to elders, persons with disabilities and Medicaid members. They serve people in more remote towns where Shuttle Buses are not cost efficient. 69 volunteer drivers use their own vehicles to provide rides 7 days-a-week. TVT volunteers give more than 55,000 work hours annually, an in-kind value of almost $600,000. While most trips are provided in-county, they also bring passengers to medical specialists across the state and even occasionally as far as Boston or New York City. In FY19 the Dial-A-Ride System provided 65,500 rides to Medicaid recipients and nearly 83,400 rides to the elderly and disabled. 81% of trips are to medical facilities, 16% to grocery stores or meal sites and 3% elsewhere. Surveyed riders gave TVT Dial-a-Ride a 98% approval rating. Shuttle Bus routes operate 7 days-a-week in densely populated corridors, providing 167,000 rides annually. Every bus in the fleet is equipped with a wheelchair lift, two built-in child seats, seat belts and bike-carrying racks. More than half of the respondents to the 2019 bus rider survey reported a household income below poverty level. They also indicated riding the bus to access work, job training or school (71%), shopping (22%) and medical care (31%). 95% of bus riders say TVT routes get them where they need them to go on time. Trip planning via TVT is also available on Google Maps. Bus riders may also access real-time \"where\\'s my bus\" information with the Transit app on their mobile devices. == Ridership == U.S. Department of Commerce indicates 38% of the region’s population lives below the poverty level, is aged 65 or older or has a disability. These groups are considered “transit-dependent” because of risk indicators for isolation and poor access to the food and medicine. Aging Vermonters need more medical care and may become less fit to drive themselves. The region’s elderly population is growing (from 15% in 2000 to a projected 30% in 2030). Financial pressures create more transit need (VT people living in poverty rose from 9% in 2000 to 11.7% in 2010; and U.S. News & World Report lists Vermonters’ yearly cost of driving at $12,869/year (that’s 23% of VT’s median household income). TVT transportation services allow them to reach all the places needed to live a healthy life. Vermont’s transit-dependent population is growing quickly (from 15% in 2000 to a projected 30% in 2030) and TVT must grow to keep pace with its needs. == References == == External links == Tri-Valley Transit website',\n",
              " 'The nature of the activities of advocacy groups is highly dependent on the scope and extent on group aims and objectives. Motives for advocacy group action may be based on a shared political, religious, moral, health or commercial position. Groups use varied methods to try to achieve their aims including lobbying, media campaigns, publicity stunts, polls, research, and policy briefings. Some groups are supported or backed by powerful business or political interests and exert considerable influence on the political process, while others have few or no such resources. == Letter-writing, petitions and marches == Traditionally, the campaigns of pressure groups have included things such as letter-writing, petitions and marches. For example, in the mid-1980s, LIFE compiled a petition of more than 2,000,000 names opposed to abortion, organised a \"Mail MPs a Mountain\" campaign in 1987 and employed postcard campaigns in 1989 and 1990 against the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990.Marches and demonstrations organised by the Anti-Poll Tax Federation in 1990 were said to have contributed to Margaret Thatcher\\'s resignation as Prime Minister in November that year, and led to the subsequent replacement of the 1989 Community Charge (poll tax) with council tax in 1993. In February 2003, millions took to the streets as part of the Stop the War Coalition\\'s efforts to persuade the government not to deploy US forces in Iraq.In countries such as the United States, petition-signing and letter-writing have been used to good effect at pride marches. These have been influential in the repeal of sodomy laws, support for civil unions and same-sex marriage, and on supporting anti-discrimination legislation. For example, in the 1998 Asbury Park pride march, the New Jersey Lesbian and Gay Coalition distributed postcards to Christine Todd Whitman and to two members of the state assembly asking them to oppose a state version of the Defense of Marriage Act. The Philadelphia Lesbian and Gay Task Force also distributed an \"Update Call to Action\", urging people to make telephone calls to state officials and write letters in support of education reform, revising state education policies and encouraging lawmakers to add sexual orientation and gender identity as protected rights under the Pennsylvania Civil Rights Initiative.Following concerns over a proposed ban on hunting with dogs and lack of concern for rural issues, in 2002 the Countryside Alliance organised \"the march for Liberty and Livelihood\", which allegedly attracted over 400,000 people (including the Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith) and attracted supporters from New Zealand, Australia, Canada, the United States and across Europe. == Directly influencing the legislative process == In most liberal democracies, advocacy groups tend to use the bureaucracy as the main channel of influence – because, in liberal democracies, this is where the decision-making power lies. The aim of advocacy groups here is to attempt to influence a member of the legislature to support their cause by voting a certain way in the legislature. Access to this channel is generally restricted to groups with insider status such as large corporations and trade unions – groups with outsider status are unlikely to be able to meet with ministers or other members of the bureaucracy to discuss policy. What must be understood about groups exerting influence in the bureaucracy is; \"the crucial relationship here [in the bureaucracy] is usually that between the senior bureaucrats and leading business or industrial interests\". This supports the view that groups with greater financial resources at their disposal will generally be better able to influence the decision-making process of government. The advantages that large businesses have is mainly due to the fact that they are key producers within their countries economy and, therefore, their interests are important to the government as their contributions are important to the economy. According to George Monbiot, the influence of big business has been strengthened by \"the greater ease with which corporations can relocate production and investment in a global economy\". This suggests that in the ever modernising world, big business has an increasing role in influencing the bureaucracy and in turn, the decision-making process of government. Core insider groups have the ability to directly influence the formation of government policy at its primary sage through direct consultation with ministers, the civil service and government-appointed bodies working on these legislative proposals. Beyond these core insiders, specialist insider groups may also be called in to give specific information on a particular issue when it is necessary that their point of views or specialist interest is represented in discussions with ministers, the civil service or the government of the day.This consultation may involve informal discussions with relevant departments, or be more structured around a Green Paper Many larger groups employ lobbyists to pursue their legislative goals, and of those the richest groups maintain permanent Westminster offices. In the modern era, it has become more common for groups to employ lobbyists who will use their contacts on behalf of the pressure group in question in exchange for a fee; however, groups whose aims are local and limited in scale may be able to achieve their goals without needing to lobby, in contrast to broader-based groups.In the British cash-for-questions affair, which began when The Guardian newspaper alleged that London\\'s most successful parliamentary lobbyist, Ian Greer of Ian Greer Associates, had bribed two Conservative Members of Parliament in exchange for asking parliamentary questions, and other tasks, on behalf of the Egyptian owner of Harrods department store, Mohamed Al-Fayed. The controversy prompted John Major to instigate the Nolan Committee, to review the issue of standards in public life.Lobbying in the US and in the UK is regulated to stop the worst abuses which can develop into corruption. In the United States the Internal Revenue Service makes a clear distinction between lobbying and advocacy. == Influencing political parties == Advocacy groups can cultivate links with political parties in order to influence policy decisions. This is better done when the party is a party of opposition, as a party in government it will he hindered by time constraints, and policy formation is likely to be \"top-down\", not \"bottom-up\". However, when a party is in opposition, it will be more accepting towards a variety of ideas in order to broaden its support and formulate new policies. During Labour\\'s time in opposition, groups such as Charter 88 and the Electoral Reform Society attempted to cultivate links with the party between 1979 and 1997.Another way groups can cultivate links with political parties is through campaign finance. For instance; in the UK, as the Conservative Party\\'s campaigns are often funded by large corporations, it has been argued that many of its campaigns reflect the interests of businesses. In the United States, George W. Bush\\'s re-election campaign in 2004 was the most expensive in American history and was financed mainly by large corporations and industrial interests that the Bush administration represented in government. Conversely, left-wing parties are often funded by organised labour – when the British Labour Party was formed, it was largely funded by trade unions. Often, political parties are actually formed as a result of group pressure, for example, the Labour Party in the UK was formed out of the new trade-union movement which lobbied for the rights of workers. == Embarking on legal action == The judicial branch of government can also be used by advocacy groups to exert influence, especially in states that have codified constitutions, such as the United States. For example, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) lobbied against the Topeka Board of Education in 1954 (Brown v. Board of Education), arguing that segregation of education based on race was unconstitutional. As a result of group pressure from the NAACP, the supreme court unanimously ruled that racial segregation in education was indeed unconstitutional and such practices were banned. This is a novel example of how advocacy groups can exert influence in the judicial branch of government. Although British courts do not have the same powers of judicial review as the US Supreme Court, litigation has been deemed a successful tactic for British pressure groups. Such action generally works on four levels: Where a court finds that a government has acted ultra vires; Where the rules in place violate EU law or the European Convention on Human Rights; Where an Act of Parliament or action of a public official violates the Human Rights Act 1998; Where litigation raises public awareness of an issue, irrespective of the outcome of the case. For example, the Pro-Life Alliance attempted to use the Human Rights Act to prevent the separation of conjoined twins Jodie and Mary, where it became clear that Mary would die as a result of the procedure, in order to highlight loopholes in the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. == Direct action campaigns == Use of direct action is increasingly popular among pressure groups. The premise of direct group action stems from the concept that traditional methods of influencing government policy are flawed, and that more direct protests, acts of civil disobedience and (in more extreme cases) illegal acts and violence may offer the best opportunity of group success, as they captivate media attention.In the 1970s and 1980s, direct action was often used by gay liberation movements; for example, the Gay Activists Alliance in the United States often used \"zaps\" to gain their objectives. == References ==',\n",

              " 'Streetcars in Los Angeles over history have included horse-drawn streetcars and cable cars, and later extensive electric streetcar networks of the Los Angeles Railway and Pacific Electric Railway and their predecessors. Also included are modern light rail lines. == Horse-drawn streetcars (1874–1897) == Horse-drawn streetcars started with the Spring and Sixth Street Railroad in 1874. Single truck, open air cars traversed unpaved streets. Numerous companies built tracks, with some merging to form larger networks. More railroads of the era included the Main Street and Agricultural Park Railway, the Depot Railway, the City Railroad, and the Central Railroad. The last horsecars were converted to electric in 1897. == Cable cars (1885–1902) == Cable car street railways in Los Angeles first began operating up Bunker Hill in 1885, with a total of three companies operating in the period through 1902, when the lines were electrified and electric streetcars were introduced largely following the cable car routes. There were roughly 25 miles (40 km) of routes, connecting 1st and Main in what was then the Los Angeles Central Business District as far as the communities known today as Lincoln Heights, Echo Park/Filipinotown, and the Pico-Union district. A large viaduct over the Southern Pacific yard operated from 1889 to 1896, colloquially known as the Cape Horn Viaduct. Angel\\'s Flight should not be confused as a cable car because it is a funicular railway operating from Broadway up Bunker Hill. == Electric streetcar systems (1887–1965) == The use of cable traction in Los Angeles was short lived. The Los Angeles Electric Railway began operations in 1887. Electrically-powered streetcar systems were numerous, but were largely consolidated into two large networks. In 1901, Henry Huntington bought various electric streetcar companies operating mostly within the City of Los Angeles (and not in the San Fernando Valley, Harbor area or Westside) and combined them into the Los Angeles Railway with its \"yellow cars\". This system operated with narrow gauge tracks and primarily provided local service along its lines. This was the most popular rail operator in Los Angeles based on passenger numbers. In 1902, Huntington and banker Isaias W. Hellman established the Pacific Electric Railway, which would acquire other railways, providing interurban service to new suburban developments and surrounding towns in what is now Greater Los Angeles (Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino County and Riverside Counties). The company operated distinctive \"red cars\". The explosion of the highway construction and car ownership before and after World War II reduced the demand for passenger rail services, and many lines were controversially converted to bus service by 1955. After being transferred to municipal ownership under the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transit Authority, all former Pacific Electric and Los Angeles Railway services had ended by 1963. Elements of the film Who Framed Roger Rabbit are loosely based on the closure and dismantling of Los Angeles\\' electric streetcars. == LACMTA Metro light rail (1990–present) == The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission was formed to coordinate transit planning in the county. After the passage of Proposition A in 1980, light rail had emerged as a preferred mode for new services. Partially rebuilt on former Pacific Electric corridors, the new rail lines differ from the last generation of services by operating almost entirely in a dedicated right of way without interference from cars. As of 2021, the system consists of four lines: The A Line opened in 1990 as the Blue Line, operating both on city streets in Downtown Los Angeles and Downtown Long Beach, as well as on a dedicated surface and underground rights of way. It is built on a section of the former Pacific Electric Long Beach Line. The C Line opened as the Green Line in 1995. It operated mostly in the median of Interstate 105 between Redondo Beach, the LAX area and Norwalk. The L Line opened as the Gold Line in 2003 and now operates between Downtown L.A. and Azusa in the northeast and East Los Angeles in the southeast. It is planned to be split up and absorbed into the A an E line in the future. The E Line between Downtown L.A. and Santa Monica opened its first section in 2012 as the Expo Line. It operates on a section of the former Santa Monica Air Line.Additional services are planned in the future: The East San Fernando Light Rail Transit Project will reinstate local rail service in the San Fernando Valley, connecting to other Metro services as well as commuter rail and Amtrak services primarily via Van Nuys Boulevard and San Fernando Road. == Historic Downtown LA Streetcar (proposed) == The Historic Downtown Los Angeles Streetcar is a planned local streetcar in Downtown Los Angeles. == See also == Streetcars in San Pedro Streetcars in Long Beach Streetcars in Redlands == References ==',\n",

              " 'Devata (pl: devatas, meaning \\'the gods\\') (Devanagari: देवता; Khmer: ទេវតា (tevoda); Thai: เทวดา (tevada); Javanese, Balinese, Sundanese, Malay: dewata; Batak languages: debata (Toba), dibata (Karo), naibata (Simalungun); diwata (Philippine languages)) are smaller and more focused Devas (Deities) in Indian religions, such as Hinduism and Buddhism. The term \"devata\" itself can also mean deva. They can be either male or female. Every human activity has its devata, its spiritual counterpart or aspect. == Types == There are many kinds of devatas: vanadevatas (forest spirits, perhaps descendants of early nature-spirit cults), gramadevata (village gods), devatas of river crossings, caves, mountains, and so on. For example, in the Konkan region of India, Hindu devatas are often divided into five categories: Grama devatas or village deities who could be the founder deity such as Jathera or ancestral worship of Bali, and examples include Santoshi, Renuka, Aiyanar Sthana devatas or local deities, for example, those in certain places of pilgrimage like Rama in Nasik, Vithoba in Pandharpur, Krishna at Dwarka, Kali at Kolkata, Mahalakshmi at Kolhapur, Devi Kanya Kumari at Kanyakumari Kula devatas or family deities, like Khanderai and Muniandi Ishta devatas or chosen deities Vastu devatas or Gruha devatas, a class of deities that preside over the house.Following are some of the important types of Devatas in Sri Lankan Buddhism: Bandara Devathavo are devatas of trees, mountains, etc. Gambara Devathavo are devatas of the villages Graha Devathavo are devatas of planets == Scriptures == Some well-known Hindu-Buddhist heavenly beings belong to the group of devatas, such as apsaras or vidhyadaris (female cloud and water spirits) and their male counterparts, the gandharvas (heavenly musicians). Devatas often occur in many Buddhist Jatakas, Hindu epics such as the Ramayana and the Mahabharata and in many other Buddhist holy scriptures. The island of Bali is nicknamed Pulau Dewata (Indonesian: \"islands of devata or island of gods\") because of its vivid Hindu culture and traditions. In Indonesia, the term hyang is equivalent to devata. In Hinduism, the devatas that guard the eight, nine and ten cardinal points are called Lokapala (Guardians of the Directions) or, more specifically in ancient Java tradition, Dewata Nawa Sanga (Guardians of Nine Directions). == See also == Demigod Surya Majapahit == References == Palani, Sivasiva. \"New Angles On Angels.\" Hinduism Today, Sep 1992.

              " 'Horde (originally called Beheadoth) is the unblack metal solo project of Australian musician Jayson Sherlock, formerly of Mortification and Paramaecium. In 1994, the only studio album, Hellig Usvart, was released on Nuclear Blast Records. With a session line-up, Horde played live in 2006 in Norway and in 2010 in Finland and Germany. Hellig Usvart proved to be a seminal release for the unblack metal movement, and the album was highly controversial in the secular black metal scene at the time it was released. == History == Sherlock recorded one studio album, Hellig Usvart (\"Holy Unblack\"), under the pseudonym \"Anonymous\" (a possible play on \"Euronymous\", Mayhem guitarist), releasing it on Nuclear Blast in 1994, followed by a later re-release by Rowe Productions. The album title is Norwegian, a fact which led many to believe, while Sherlock was still anonymous, that Horde originated from Norway, a fact backed up by the poor production quality on the album, considered to be a trademark of Norwegian black metal.Upon the initial release of Hellig Usvart, a publicity campaign was launched throughout the black metal community, revolving around Sherlock being credited as \"Anonymous\". Unsuccessful death threats were given to Markus Staiger at Nuclear Blast, who founded the record label, to reveal the identity of the anonymous musician who had created the album, although the identity of the musician was later revealed as Jayson Sherlock. Horde as an entity also received death threats for being a Christian band playing black metal. Upon its original release in 1994, 4,000 copies of the album were printed. In 1999, Rowe Productions purchased the remaining copies and distributed them worldwide. Hellig Usvart was re-released for the album\\'s tenth anniversary in 2004 on Rowe Productions and Soundmass with an additional track entitled \"Mine Heart Doth Beseech Thee (O Master)\", which was originally included on Godspeed: Australian Metal Compilation in 1994 by Rowe Productions and also included on later Soundmass reissues of Hellig Usvart. The album is difficult to come by and sought after by many. In April 2007, a live album, The Day of Total Armageddon Holocaust – Alive in Oslo, was released on Veridon Music and contains the 2006 performance of Horde at Nordic Fest; a video album of the concert was released by the same label on DVD. In May 2008, Polish label Metal Mind Productions released a remaster of Hellig Usvart with three bonus tracks from the 2007 live album. In 2018, Soundmass released Hellig Usvart on vinyl and later reissued it on CD in 2019 for the album\\'s twenty-fifth anniversary. Hellig Usvart pioneered the previously unheard of genre of \"unblack metal\" (sometimes referred to as \"Holy UnBlack Metal\"); since its release, major bands such as A Hill to Die Upon, Antestor, and Crimson Moonlight and minor bands such as Dark Endless (also an unblack metal band with one member) and Hortor have emerged as proponents of Christian unblack metal. The album is satirical of the satanic black metal scene in that it twists common black metal phrases into a Christian ideal. The general message of Hellig Usvart is the destruction and rejection of Satan, in favour of God. There is also direct and indirect praise of God throughout the record. Horde\\'s music is mostly dark, simple, and very fast driving unblack metal-style with high-pitched shrieking or growling vocals. Some tracks, such as \"Invert the Inverted Cross\", utilise double-bass drum work to drive the song. Keyboards are sprinkled in throughout the album as well and appear on such tracks as \"Release and Clothe the Virgin Sacrifice\".Horde gave their first live performance at Nordic Fest in Oslo, Norway on 3 November 2006, with Jayson Sherlock as drummer and vocalist and with help from three members of the Christian unblack metal band Drottnar under the stage names Kvest, Bøddel, and Gestalt. The band played its second live show at Immortal Metal Fest, Finland on 17 April 2010, with the same live line-up as Nordic Fest. According to the festival\\'s website, Sherlock agreed to play the show because the festival celebrated its tenth anniversary. Horde was also announced to play at the Blast of Eternity festival in Germany in November 2010. == Band members == Current membersJayson \"Anonymous\" Sherlock – vocals, drums (1994–present), guitars, bass, keyboards (1994)Live musiciansSimon \"Pilgrim\" Rosen – vocals (2006, 2010) Karl Fredrik \"Kvest\" Lind – guitars (2006, 2010, 2012) Bengt \"Bøddel\" Olsson – guitars (2006, 2010, 2012) Håvar \"Gestalt\" Wormdahl – bass (2006, 2010, 2012)Timeline == Discography == Studio albumsHellig Usvart (1994)Live albumsThe Day of Total Armageddon Holocaust – Alive in Oslo (2007)Video albumsThe Day of Total Armageddon Holocaust – Alive in Oslo (2007) == References == == External links == Rowe Productions',\n",
              " 'King Edward VI High School is a coeducational secondary school and sixth form located in the Highfields area of Stafford, England. The school\\'s sixth form forms part of the Stafford Collegiate. It is a non-selective state school admitting boys and girls from ages 11–18. The school was formed in 1977 following the amalgamation of King Edward VI Boys’ Grammar School and Stafford Girls’ High School. == Introduction == King Edward VI High School serves mainly the west of Stafford to the Shropshire border, and admits students aged between 11 – 19 years. The school catchment area includes Western Downs, the Rowley Avenue area, Forebridge, Doxey, the top end of the Highfields Estate and the villages to the west of Stafford i.e. Bradley, Derrington, Seighford, Haughton, Gnosall, Church Eaton and Woodseaves. The school was formed by merging the long established selective schools, King Edward VI Boys’ Grammar School and Stafford Girls’ High School, in 1977. The selective element was removed in order to create the comprehensive school taking pupils of all abilities. The premises of the Girls’ High School were enlarged and the school was based there. The closure of the old grammar school led to the creation of the independent fee-paying Stafford Grammar School. == School history == === King Edward VI Boys Grammar School === The Free Grammar School of King Edward VI was first established in Stafford in 1550 to provide free education to young boys. In 1862 a new building was erected for the school on Newport Road and would serve as the home of the boys\\' grammar school for well over 100 years. The old King Edward VI building on Newport Road remained in education hands and was turned over to Chetwynd Middle School before later becoming what is now known as the Chetwynd Centre, home of the Stafford Collegiate, where many Post-16 subjects are taught as part of an agreement between the Stafford secondary schools and Stafford College of Further Education. === Stafford Girls\\' High School === Stafford Girls\\' High School was established in 1907 as a grammar school for girls and was based at The Oval, just off the Lichfield Road, with some accommodation for students at The Hough Cottage (now an Italian restaurant). The school later moved to a new site off West Way, close to Stafford Castle; the modern home of King Edward VI High School. In 1977 King Edward VI Grammar School and Stafford Girls\\' High School were amalgamated to create a comprehensive off West Way. === Amalgamation === The two schools merged in September 1976, with King Edwards VI Boys Grammar vacating their site to move to the Stafford Girls\\' High School site off Newport Road. The old girls\\' school buildings on The Oval also remained in education hands, later becoming an art college before being converted into residential apartments. === Recent history === In 2003, Colin Elstone was appointed as Headteacher, serving until 2010 before his retirement. The school achieved its Ofsted status as \"Good with outstanding features\" under his leadership. From 2010 to 2014 the Headteacher was Russell Davis, before the current Headteacher, and former Deputy Headteacher, Jason Christey was appointed in 2015. The school achieved another \"Good\" Ofsted rating during its inspection in 2018.

              " 'The Rock \\'n\\' Roll Las Vegas Marathon & 1/2 Marathon is an annual marathon foot-race run on the Las Vegas Strip and in parts of the Las Vegas Valley, Nevada. The 26.2-mile (42.2 km) race was one of the oldest marathons in the United States, having been run between 1967 - 2019. == History == The initial concept was to attract nationally and internationally recognized runners; this was partially successful. Morris Aarbo of Canada won the first year with a time of 2:23:06, ahead of two marathoners from Turkey. A notable participant in the inaugural race was Harry Reid, who at the time was involved with local Nevada government. The subsequent 17 annual races fielded mostly local runners with a sprinkling of national- and international-caliber runners. When the Las Vegas Sun newspaper scuttled its sponsorship of the marathon in 1969, the recently formed Las Vegas Track Club took over the event. Over the ensuing years, enrollment in the race remained low—in the range of 100 to 200 entrants—until the running boom of 1978 when the numbers bumped up for a year or two. Subsequently, entrants again diminished, with fewer than 102 finishers in 1982. In 1983 Al Boka assumed directorship and inaugurated what he expected to be a very fast course. The new course bumped registration up to over 450 participants. However this downhill course proved to be too severe on the runners’ quadriceps, so after three years this route was discontinued. The course was changed to have a smaller vertical drop in 1986. Also beginning in 1986, prize money was offered to 19 age division winners. Later a half marathon was also added to the mix. Boka\\'s strategy to attract more runners was successful; by 1992 enrollment exceeded 2000.Boka remained race director of the Las Vegas Marathon for 23 years until he sold the event in 2005 to Devine Racing, a Chicago-based race organization company, which was also responsible for several other races, including the Los Angeles Marathon. That year the marathon date was changed from January to December after securing Las Vegas Events endorsement along with approval of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. Both organizations were motivated by attracting visitors during the \"slower\" December time period and their consent was necessary for holding any large downtown event. The course was also changed to take place partially in the city. === The Rock \\'n\\' Roll Era === In 2009 the race was acquired by the Competitor Group, Inc. and incorporated into its Rock \\'n\\' Roll Marathon Series and the course was changed for a fourth time since 1982.Since the Competitor Group acquired the race in 2009, the number of full distance (26.219 mi (42.195 km)) marathoners has diminished, while the overall participation has increased dramatically . The venue itself, held at night on the Strip, has become more of a pop culture phenomenon than an international marathon. Most runners elect to do the half marathon while a few run ‘half of the half ‘ or 6.555 mi (10.549 km). Runners in the 2011 event reported illness, overcrowding, and at least one person was hospitalized.In 2014 the overall entrants exceeded 38,000 participants with only 3,208 runners completing the full 26.2 miles. 25,251 runners finished the half-marathon, 2,194 runners completed the 6.555-mile course while the balance ran a 5 kilometer (3.1 mile) race the day before the main event. Many of the short-distance runners were costumed. The Monte Carlo Casino promoted a ‘run-thru wedding’ during the race. While a high volume of entrants is necessary to carry the cost of closing the Las Vegas Strip for more than 12 hours, the paucity of actual marathoners distinguish the Las Vegas event from other big city venues such as Boston, New York, Chicago, London, or Berlin where the number of marathon finishers range from about 20,000 to more than 30,000. While successful as a commercial, for profit venture, this race falls short of the original vision to make the Las Vegas Marathon a world class, competitive running event. In 2017, the race was acquired by and is now organized by the IRONMAN Group, part of Wanda Sports Holdings. Organizers decided not to hold the 2020 edition of the race on its original date in November due to the coronavirus pandemic. Entrants were given either refunds or automatic entry deferral to 2021. == Course == From 1967 to 2004 the marathon course was located on several different routes within Clark County, but outside of downtown Las Vegas. In 1983, Al Boka inaugurated a course that started on State Route 160, high in the Spring Mountains west of Las Vegas on the road to Pahrump, and descended approximately 2,900 feet (883.9m) into the valley, finishing at the Renaissance Center located at the corner of East Tropicana and Eastern Avenues. The 1986 marathon course was changed to a smaller, 700-foot (213.36m) vertical drop. The new route headed north on State Route 604 from Jean NV, paralleling Interstate 15 much of the way, to its finish point at Sunset Park. In 2005, the race course was moved from suburban Clark County to the Las Vegas \"Strip\" and partially in the city of Las Vegas. The loop course between 2005 and 2008 began and finished at Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino. After heading north on Las Vegas Boulevard (The Strip), to the Fremont Street Experience and the Downtown area, the course meandered further northwest of the city and ultimately looped back to the west before reaching Mandalay Bay\\'s parking lot at the finish. The Half Marathon Course remained along the Strip. In its most recent iteration, the full marathon began on Las Vegas Boulevard heading north through the Downtown casino area, proceeded further to the northwest, turns around and finished again on the strip near the Mirage and Venetian Casinos.The event was not held in 2020 or 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was announced in February, 2021 that Competitor group would be next hold their Las Vegas events on February 26 and 27, 2022. The decision was made to move the event due to the increasing difficulty of scheduling closures of the Las Vegas Boulevard that didn\\'t conflict with sporting events involving the Vegas Golden Knights at T-Mobile Arena or the Las Vegas Raiders at Allegiant Stadium. Furthermore, Competitor announced that the Rock \\'n Roll Las Vegas event would no longer offer the full marathon distance, due to poor feedback on the event from prior participants. Competitor will instead offer the half-marathon distance, 10 km and 5 km races. == Winners == Key: Course record (in bold) 1967 — Morris Aarbo: 2:23:06 Las Vegas Sun Marathon (first course) == Notes == == References == List of winnersLeydig, Jack & Milroy, Andy (2011-12-05).

Hitler\\'s skull had been sent to Moscow in 1945, where it was placed in the State Archives in Moscow. In that the base was scheduled to be relinquished to East Germany, the commander consulted KGB Director Yuri Andropov for instructions. To prevent the site from becoming a shrine for neo-Nazis, Andropov ordered that the grave\\'s contents be crushed, burned and scattered. The process was completed the next day at Schönebeck, and what was left over was dumped into the Elbe River. In 1995, the long secret story would be revealed in the book The Death of Hitler: The Full Story with New Evidence from Secret Russian Archives, by Ada Petrova and Peter Watson.

The marchers, mostly well-dressed, middle-aged white Americans, protested U.S. President Nixon\\'s decision to reduce the American commitment rather than to take the war into North Vietnam. Citizens in the Stickney Township, west of Chicago, voted 4,071 to 1,552 to incorporate the new city of Burbank, Illinois. The Chicago Tribune noted that \"The new city is bounded by 77th and 87th streets and Cicero and Sayre avenues and will have a population of about 30,000 residents.\" Born: Barry Pepper, Canadian film and Emmy Award-winning television actor; in Campbell River, British Columbia == April 5, 1970 (Sunday) == In order to prevent the court-ordered busing of students to achieve racial desegregation, Florida\\'s Governor Claude Kirk issued an executive order appointing himself as the School Superintendent of Manatee County and suspending superintendent Jack Davidson and the rest of the school board, and then traveled to Bradenton the next day to order bus drivers not to comply with the orders of U.S. District Judge Ben Krentzman. Kirk reversed himself the following Sunday, after Judge Krentzman ruled that he was in contempt of court. Krentzman assessed a fine of $10,000 per day (equivalent to more than $66,500 a day fifty years later) to be paid personally by Governor Kirk for every day that he interfered with the court\\'s orders. In the worst killing in California police history, four California Highway Patrol officers were shot and killed while confronting two armed suspects outside a restaurant in Newhall, California. Officers Walt Frago, Roger Gore, George Alleyn, and James Pence were all fatally wounded within four minutes before midnight after Frago and Gore had stopped a car driven by Bobby Davis. A passenger in the car, Jack Twinning, fired the first shots after Frago made his approach to the vehicle, and Gore was killed by Davis. The next day, Twinning killed himself after being cornered by police. Davis was arrested, and eventually hanged himself in prison, 39 years after the killings. Twenty-seven people were treated at the Memorial Hospital of California in Los Angeles for food poisoning after ingesting the hallucinogen LSD on potato chips served at a private party. The 27, eight of whom were admitted, were among 40 who were taken by the Los Angeles County sheriff\\'s department after being called to the festivities at the South Bay Club, a \"singles apartment\" complex for unmarried people in Playa Del Rey, California, where 200 guests were attending a party for a departing tenant. One of the people identified as a guest would later be arrested and sentenced to six years to life in prison after pleading guilty. Died: Alfred Sturtevant, 78, American geneticist known as the discoverer of genetic mapping Karl von Spreti, 63, West Germany\\'s ambassador to Guatemala, was murdered five days after he was kidnapped by the terrorist group Fuerzas Armadas Rebeldes (\"Rebel Armed Forces\"). The Guatemalan government refused FAR\\'s demand that 22 FAR members be released from prison, along with the payment of US$700,000 in cash, and Spreti was killed by a single gunshot to his head. == April 6, 1970 (Monday) == BBC Radio 4 broadcast the first edition of its long-running evening news programme PM. Photojournalists Sean Flynn of Time magazine, and Dana Stone of CBS, crossed into Cambodia by motorcycle to report on the Vietnam War, and disappeared. Flynn, who was the son of actor Errol Flynn, and Stone were among five journalists who had crossed together for their assignments to take photos and film footage. Captured also were freelance photographer Claude Arpin of France, and two cameramen for Japan\\'s Fuji Commercial Television, Yujiro Takagi and Akira Kusaka. The last time their colleagues saw them was when the men were waved through a roadblock set up by the North Vietnamese Army, which had used Cambodia as a base for operations. In 1986, the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency would declassify a report that had concluded that Flynn and Stone \"probably were executed in 1971 by an officer of the Khmer Rouge\". King Frederik IX of Denmark overturned his Bentley convertible automobile while driving on a Copenhagen street, but was not seriously injured. After climbing out of his car, which skidded on a slippery street, hit the curb and landed on its side\", the King rode part of the way back to the Amalienberg Palace in an ambulance, then asked the driver to stop, got out, and walked the rest of the way, \"apparently wary that his arrival by ambulance might cause alarm.\" Died: Dr. Sam Sheppard, 46, American neurosurgeon who had served 12 years in prison after being wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife; from encephalopathy associated with his consumption of alcohol. El Deif Ahmed, 33, Egyptian comedian and film actor and part of the film trio Tholathy Adwa\\'a El Masrah; from a heart attack == April 7, 1970 (Tuesday) == The small town of McIntosh, Alabama, north of Mobile, was incorporated. Major League Baseball returned to Milwaukee, as the Milwaukee Brewers played their first game, only seven days after existing as the Seattle Pilots. Milwaukee\\'s previous major team, the Milwaukee Braves, had played their final game on September 12, 1965, before relocating to Atlanta. The Brewers lost to the California Angels, 12 to 0, before a crowd of 36,107 at Milwaukee County Stadium. At the Academy Awards, Midnight Cowboy became the first (and to date, the only) X-rated film to receive the Oscar for Best Picture; John Schlesinger won Best Director. John Wayne received his first and only Oscar for Best Actor, for his performance as Rooster Cogburn in the western True Grit. == April 8, 1970 (Wednesday) == Thirty-four schoolchildren in Egypt were killed, and 42 wounded, when their elementary school was struck by air-to-ground missiles and bombs by F-4 Phantom II jets flown by the Israeli Air Force. The carnage near the city of Faqous, apparently caused by the IAF impression that the building was a military target, was a factor in the ending of Israel\\'s Operation Priha five days later. A huge gas explosion at a subway construction site in Osaka, Japan killed 79 people and injured over 400. The explosions took place at about 5:30 p.m. during the evening rush hour. By a vote of 51 against and 45 in favor, the United States Senate rejected the nomination of G. Harold Carswell to become a justice on the United States Supreme Court. Born: Andrej Plenković, Prime Minister of Croatia since 2016; in Zagreb, SR Croatia, Yugoslavia Died: Prince Felix of Bourbon-Parma, 76, Prince Consort of Luxembourg as the husband of the European nation\\'s ruler, Grand Duchess Charlotte, from 1919 until her abdication in 1964 Julius Pokorny, 82, Austro-Hungarian born Swiss linguist; from injuries sustained after being struck by a train == April 9, 1970 (Thursday) == Only two days before the scheduled liftoff of the Apollo 13 lunar mission, command module pilot Thomas K. Mattingly was removed from the crew and replaced by the backup CM pilot, John L. Swigert Jr. The alternative to lifting off on April 11 with a replacement crew member would have been to postpone the launch to the next favorable launch date, May 9. A pre-launch physical examination showed that Mattingly had contracted rubella (also called German measles) after exposure to the disease from another member of the backup crew, Charles M. Duke Jr. (who, in turn, had contracted the disease from one of his children). With the switch of one state legislator\\'s vote from \"no\" to \"yes\", the New York State House of Representatives cleared the way for legalized abortion in that U.S. state. The State Senate had previously voted, 31 to 26, to pass an even more wide-reaching bill. With 150 members, the State House required at least 76 votes to approve a bill, and the initial roll call vote was 74 to 74, with the House Speaker declining to cast a vote. At that point, Assemblyman George M. Michaels stood up and, crying, told the group that he was changing his vote, adding that \"I cannot go back to my family and say George Michaels killed this bill. I fully appreciate that this is the termination of my career.\" With the vote now 75 in favor, 73 against, Speaker Perry B. Duryea Jr. then added the 76th vote, clearing the way for abortions during the first 24 weeks of pregnancy. As Michaels had predicted, his yes vote did mean the end of his political career and he was never elected to another office. == April 10, 1970 (Friday) == With the page one headline \"PAUL QUITS THE BEATLES\", Britain\\'s national daily tabloid newspaper, the Daily Mirror, broke the story that Paul McCartney was leaving The Beatles. McCartney\\'s parting of ways with John Lennon, and bandmates George Harrison and Ringo Starr, effectively brought a permanent end to the most popular rock musician group in history. McCartney issued a press release later in the day in conjunction with promotional copies of his first album as a solo artist, McCartney. The Autocephalous Orthodox Church in America, the organization of several hundred Russian Orthodox congregations in the United States and Canada, was granted authority to conduct its own affairs (autocephaly) by Patriarch Alexius I and the 14 bishops of the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church. John Bekish, the Russian Orthodox Archbishop of New York and leader of the North American Russian Orthodox organization since 1965, became the 15th bishop of the Holy Synod as Ireney, Metropolitan of all America and Canada. Born: Tim Houston, Canadian politician, Premier of Nova Scotia, in Halifax Q-tip (stage name for Kamaal ibn John Fareed), American hip-hop rapper and producer; as Jonathan William Davis, in Harlem, New York City == April 11, 1970 (Saturday) == Apollo 13, carrying astronauts Jim Lovell, Jack Swigert and Fred Haise, was launched from Cape Kennedy at 2:13 in the afternoon local time (13:13 Houston time, 19:13 UTC), with plans to make the third crewed landing on the Moon, which would have been the first to explore the lunar highlands. The center engine of the Saturn S-II stage shut down about 2 minutes and 12 seconds early, but this caused no flight control problems. Born: Trevor Linden, Canadian ice hockey player who had a 19-season career in the NHL; in Medicine Hat, Alberta Died: Cathy O\\'Donnell (stage name for Ann Steely), 46, American film actress; from cancer == April 12, 1970 (Sunday) == Seventeen people were killed and 40 injured near Roseworthy, South Australia, when a double-decker bus was driven at full speed into the path of a train. The driver, who was found to have been intoxicated, apparently did not see the Bluebird railcar train moving down the tracks, and the impact caused the bus to roll over, crushing the upper deck and the people inside. Fifty-two of the surviving 125 crewmen on the Soviet submarine K-8 died when the vessel was flooded with carbon monoxide as they were attempting to extinguish a fire. Four days earlier, eight other crew had been killed when they were sealed off inside sections of the sub during an effort to fight the blaze. The remaining crew had evacuated the sub, but then were ordered to go back inside while it was being towed. After 20 of the 24 nuclear weapons on board were removed, K-8 sank in the Bay of Biscay, 490 kilometres (300 mi) northwest of Spain, with 60 members of the Soviet Navy and four nuclear torpedoes, in waters 15,350 feet (4,680 m) deep. The first major NASCAR event in Alabama, the Alabama 500, was held at the Alabama International Motor Speedway in Talladega. Pete Hamilton, who had won the 1970 Daytona 500 two months earlier, won the Alabama race after leader Buddy Baker was forced out by a car wreck with 13 laps left. Born: Nick Hexum, American musician, frontman of 311, in Madison, Wisconsin == April 13, 1970 (Monday) == At 9:08 in the evening Central Time (April 14 03:08 UTC), the Mission Control team at the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston, Texas, received word from the Apollo 13 crew that an oxygen tank in the command module had exploded, and that electrical power was gradually dropping, an event that led to an abort of the planned lunar landing. The mission shifted to recalculation of the Apollo 13 route in hopes of getting the three astronauts safely back to Earth. Nine minutes after the crew had finished a 40-minute live broadcast to television viewers, astronaut Fred Haise began alerting with the words \"Okay, Houston...\" and Jim Lovell followed with \"I believe we\\'ve had a problem here.\" When ground control asked him to repeat the statement, Lovell said, \"Houston, we\\'ve had a problem.\" Twenty-five years later, the film Apollo 13 would have actor Tom Hanks, as Lovell, saying \"Houston, we have a problem.\" The initial observation was an undervoltage in two of the power-producing cells. After 93 minutes, Haise reported that oxygen pressure in the command module was dropping, and by 10:59 p.m., Mission Control determined that the three LM fuel cells had failed, that only 15 minutes of electrical power remained, and that the crew should transfer immediately to the lunar module. In the village of Xom Bien, a massacre of about 600 ethnic Vietnamese residents of Cambodia was carried out by the Khmer National Army as part of a campaign by the government of Cambodian leader Lon Nol against the nation\\'s Vietnamese-speaking minority. Shortly after midnight, troops entered the village, founded as a Roman Catholic mission on the waters of the Mekong River in the Chrouy Changvar area near Phnom Penh and removed the men and boys, placed them on Vietnamese Navy riverboats, and shot them. Days later, hundreds of the corpses of the victims (which included more from outside of Xom Bien) were seen floating down the Mekong along South Vietnam SS La Jenelle, an idle luxury cruise ship which had formerly been called SS Bahama Star, capsized in a storm as it sat at anchor in the harbor of Port Hueneme, California, and would remain tilted at a 45 degree angle for the next two years before dismantling began in 1972. While stranded in low waters, the ship was boarded by thrillseekers, and the jetty that its remains \"created [is] one of the best surf spots in California\". At the Masters Tournament in Augusta, Georgia, Billy Casper shot a 69 to defeat Gene Littler in an 18-hole playoff to win the championship.

The new nominee, in the wake of the failure of Clement Haynsworth and G. Harrold Carswell to receive confirmation, was Judge Harry A. Blackmun Blackmun would be approved unanimously by the Senate only four weeks later. NASA canceled the scheduled landing of Apollo 13 on the Moon and began new calculations for a course that could swing the spacecraft around the Moon and then bring the command module and lunar module back to Earth. By 9:30 p.m. EST (0230 UTC 15 April), the ship had completed its circuit of the Moon and fired the engines to speed the spacecraft back toward the Earth. Born: Shizuka Kudo, Japanese actress and pop music singer with 11 number one hits on the Oricon Singles Chart; in Hamura, Tokyo == April 15, 1970 (Wednesday) == At 00:21 UTC (7:21 p.m. April 14 Eastern time), the crew of Apollo 13 was partway through its \"slingshot maneuver\" around the far side of the Moon, at an altitude of approximately 158 miles (254 km) above the lunar surface. At that point, astronauts Fred Haise, Jack Swigert, and Jim Lovell had set a record for the furthest distance that human beings had ever traveled away from the Earth. During that time, they were 248,655 miles (400,171 km) above the Earth. Born: Flex Alexander, American actor and comedian; as Mark Alexander Knox in Harlem, New York City Died: Roger Hagberg, 31, American pro football player and running back for the Oakland Raiders since 1965, was killed after being struck by a car in Lafayette, California. == April 16, 1970 (Thursday) == At 1:10 in the morning local time, an avalanche buried a tuberculosis sanatorium in the French Alps near Sallanches, killing 74 people. The avalanche, 600 ft (180 m) wide, swept down the Plateau d\\'Assy and struck the children\\'s wing of the hospital and two nursing dormitories, with a 60 ft (18 m) wide wall of snow. Most of the dead were boys under the age of 15, who were asleep when the disaster struck. Two Protestant ministers with views regarding majority rule in Northern Ireland, were elected to the Stormont, the House of Commons of Northern Ireland. Reverend Ian Paisley and his assistant, Reverend William Beattie, both of the Unionist Party, defeated Labour candidates in a by-election to fill the vacancies. The National Basketball Players Association and its attorney and executive director, Larry Fleisher, filed an antitrust lawsuit to prevent a possible merger between the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the rival American Basketball Association (ABA), until a guarantee could be assured for free agency for the players of a merged league. Filed in the name of NBAPA President (and NBA point guard) Oscar Robertson against the 11 ABA and 17 NBA team owners, the lawsuit averred that a single 28-team league would prevent players from being able to negotiate with the highest bidder between the rival circuits. A partial merger would finally take place in 1976, after a court ruling to void the reserve clause in contracts that gave teams the first option to renew a player\\'s contract, and an 18-team NBA would bring in four of the remaining ABA teams. Died: Richard Neutra, 78, Austrian-American architect == April 17, 1970 (Friday) == Apollo 13 splashed down safely in the South Pacific Ocean near American Samoa, and was recovered by the amphibious assault ship USS Iwo Jima.

Jim Lovell, Fred Haise and Jack Swigert were told by Nixon, \"You did not reach the Moon but you reached the hearts of millions of people on Earth by what you did.\" Born: Saad Hariri, Prime Minister of Lebanon from 2009 to 2011 and again from 2016 to 2020; as the son of Lebanese politician (and later Prime Minister) Rafic Hariri in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Heike Friedrich, East German swimmer who held the women\\'s record for the 200m freestyle from 1986 to 1994; winner of two gold medals in the 1988 Summer Olympics and four in the 1986 world championships Died: Michał Kalecki, 70, Polish economist and neo-Marxian economics theorist == April 19, 1970 (Sunday) == Elections were held in Colombia for a new president and for the Senate and the Chamber of Representatives. Pursuant to an agreement that Colombia\\'s Conservative Party and Liberal Party would alternate control of the presidency, all four of the candidates were from factions of the Conservative Party, and none won a majority. Misael Pastrana Borrero, formerly Colombia\\'s ambassador to the United States, received 1,625,025 votes (40.7%) of those cast. His closest challenger, former President Gustavo Rojas Pinilla of the ANAPO (Alianza Nacional Popular, the National Popular Alliance) faction, had 1,561,468 or 39.1% of the votes. Charging fraud, Rojas Pinilla threatened to capture the presidency by force (as he had done in a 1953 military coup) and President Carlos Lleras Restrepo placed the country under martial law the next day In advance of the centennial of the April 22, 1870 birth of Vladimir Lenin, a 62 ft (19 m) high statue of the father of Communism, Lenin, was dedicated in East Berlin\\'s Leninplatz. East Germany\\'s Prime Minister and Communist Party general secretary, Walter Ulbricht, told a crowd of tens of thousands that the monument would remind Germans of the more than 300,000 Soviet soldiers who died in the battle for Berlin in 1945. The granite statue would be dismantled, removed and buried in 1992, after the reunification of Germany, the head would be unearthed in 2015 for a display in an exhibition. The first Lada compact car, the initial offering of the Soviet Union\\'s AvtoVAZ automobile company, rolled off the assembly line of the Volga Automotive Plant in the city of Tolyatti, in the Russian SFSR. The original model, the VAZ-2101, was marketed in Eastern Europe as the \"Zhiguli\", and in the rest of the world as the \"Lada 2101\". The first intercontinental World Cup Rally (so called because the destination from London was the city where the quadrennial FIFA World Cup was scheduled) began at Wembley Stadium as 50,000 spectators watched the start of the 1970 London to Mexico World Cup Rally, sponsored by the London Daily Mirror tabloid. The 96 drivers (from 22 nations) drove through London and on to Dover to board the ferry across the English Channel to continental Europe, with a route going through Europe, Africa and South America before proceeding through Central America.

Ten days after declaring that \"The decision I have announced tonight means that we have in sight the just peace we are seeking\", Nixon reversed the decision and announced that troop strength would not be decreased and that the war would expand into Cambodia. Hanoi and the Viet Cong had been given ample warning that they ran the risk of South Vietnamese and United States military action in Cambodia if they continued to mount attacks from neutral Cambodia as well as threatening the Lon Nol government. A new comic strip, Broom-Hilda, began its daily run in 69 American daily newspapers as one of the offerings of the Chicago Tribune Syndicate. Featuring a broom-riding witch as its title character, the strip is still drawn by cartoonist Russell Myers more than 49 years later. While Sunday, April 19, 1970, is sometimes listed as the date of the first strip, the appearance was limited to an advertisement in the Sunday comics section of the Chicago Tribune where Broom-Hilda told readers \"My friends and I will be in the Tribune every day, starting tomorrow. Come and see us.\" The New York Knicks overwhelmed the Milwaukee Bucks, 132 to 96, to win Game 5 of a best-4-of-7 semifinal and to earn the right to face the Los Angeles Lakers in the National Basketball Association championship series. The Lakers had won the NBA\\'s Western Division crown the day before against the Atlanta Hawks. Less than two weeks after the U.S. Senate declined to approve his nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court, G. Harrold Carswell resigned his lifetime appointment as a federal judge, apparently confident that he could win office as a United States Senator for Florida. Carswell failed to become the Republican Party nominee, losing by a wide margin in the September 8 primary to Congressman William C. Cramer. Born: Adriano Moraes, Brazilian professional bull rider with four world titles in professional rodeo; in Quintana, São Paulo Shemar Moore, American television actor known for The Young and the Restless; in Oakland == April 21, 1970 (Tuesday) == All 36 people on Philippine Airlines Flight 215 were killed in a crash caused by a bomb explosion in the aircraft\\'s restroom at an altitude of 10,500 feet (3,200 m). The Hawker Siddeley HS-748 had departed from Cauayan on a 174 mi (280 km) flight to Manila. Leonard Casley, a disgruntled wheat farmer in the state of Western Australia, declared his 18,500-acre (7,500 ha) farm to be the \"Hutt River Province\", and would contend for the rest of his life that his 29 sq mi (75 km2) of territory had seceded from Australia and was no longer subject to national or state laws. A little more than a year later, Casley began making money by arranging to have postage stamps printed for sale to collectors and tourists. Funded by tourism for his micronation, Casley began referring to himself as \"Prince Leonard of Hutt River\" and expanded to minting coins and printing currency. Casley died on February 13, 2019, two years after abdicating his throne to his son Graeme Casley. Born: Rob Riggle, American comedian known for Saturday Night Live; also a Lieutenant Colonel in the U.S. Marines reserve; in Louisville, Kentucky Nicole Sullivan, American comedian and actress known for MADtv and for The King of Queens; in Los Angeles == April 22, 1970 (Wednesday) == Earth Day was celebrated in the United States for the first time. The Associated Press reported the next day, \"Across the nation, trash was gathered, streets swept, ponds and parks cleaned, trees and flowers planted\" as \"youth joined hands with age across the generation gap\". In a secret meeting at the White House of his National Security Council, U.S. President Richard M. Nixon discussed the options for the United States response to the continuing use of Cambodia by the North Vietnamese Army and the Viet Cong as a base from which to launch attacks against American forces during the Vietnam War. Nixon\\'s chief national security adviser, Henry Kissinger, would recount later that the three choices were to continue the current response, favored by Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird and Secretary of State William P. Rogers; providing financial and adviser aid to an invasion by South Vietnam\\'s army without committing ground troops (favored by Kissinger); or sending U.S. troops and planes into Cambodia to attack Communist sanctuaries (favored by General Earle Wheeler, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff). While Nixon supported Kissinger\\'s option, U.S. Vice President Spiro T. Agnew made the argument for committing U.S. troops to Cambodia, the decision that Nixon ultimately adopted. A non-violent protest created Chicano Park in San Diego, California, when college student Mario Solis saw construction crews preparing to clear a popular gathering place to build a new California Highway Patrol station in a majority Hispanic-American section of the city, Barrio Logan. Much of the neighborhood had already been razed to build Interstate Highway 5 and the San Diego–Coronado Bridge. Solis quickly organized the occupation of the site by 300 neighborhood residents, and the city of San Diego and the state relented after a 12-day standoff, allowing the residents to build their own park Born: Regine Velasquez, best-selling Philippine singer and award-winning actress; in Manila == April 23, 1970 (Thursday) == The tiny European co-principality of Andorra granted women the right to vote.

Chiang Ching-kuo, the future President of the Republic of China (on the island of Taiwan), was shot at by a would-be assassin as he entered the Plaza Hotel in New York City. A plainclothes officer of the New York City Police Department struck the assassin\\'s arm and the deflected shot struck the hotel\\'s revolving door as Chiang was preparing to enter. The shooter, Peter Huang Wen-hsiung, was a Ph.D. candidate at Cornell University. He and his brother-in-law, Cheng Tzu-tsai, were arrested at the scene. Chiang, the son, and eventual successor, of Taiwanese President Chiang Kai-shek was the Vice-Premier of the island republic at the time. Cheng and Huang fled the United States after being released on bail and, after Chiang Ching-kuo\\'s 1988 passing, would return to Taiwan in 1996. The West African nation of Gambia became a republic shortly before midnight, after certification of the results of a four day long referendum; Gambian voters approved the measure by more than the required two-thirds needed under the former British colony\\'s constitution, with 84,968 in favor and 35,638 against The 452nd and final episode of the American western anthology series Death Valley Days was shown on syndicated television, bringing an end to the program after 18 seasons.

Francisco Cunha Leal, 81, Prime Minister of Portugal for seven weeks in 1920 and 1921 == April 27, 1970 (Monday) == A five-member team of physicists at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in Berkeley, California, led by Albert Ghiorso, reported that they had synthesized a new chemical element (now called Dubnium) number 105 on the periodic table At the same time, the California team disputed a 1968 report from a Soviet team at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, outside of Moscow, that the Soviets had synthesized the element first. The IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party, convened by the international unions of pure and applied chemistry and of physics, would later credit both teams with the discovery. Ghiorso\\'s team had bombarded californium-249 (an isotope of element number 98) with ions of an isotope of nitrogen and concluded that it had created an isotope of 105. An unidentified 58-year-old woman became the first person to receive a heart pacemaker to be powered by an atomic battery, in a four-hour operation at the Hôpital Broussais in Paris. The battery, powered by 150 micrograms of plutonium, reportedly had a life span of 10 years == April 28, 1970 (Tuesday) == The Roman Catholic Church restrictions on interfaith marriage were partially lifted, as the U.S. National Conference of Catholic Bishops announced a decision made by Pope Paul VI. Previously, under the 1907 papal decree Ne Temere, the non-Catholic husband or wife had to promise to raise any children in the Catholic faith. The new rules eliminated the promise, but did require that the Roman Catholic partner had to promise to do everything in their power \"to have all the children baptized and brought up in the Catholic Church\" as a prerequisite for the marriage to be recognized by the Church, and for the non-Catholic partner to state understanding of the Catholic obligation. The new rules were to take effect on October 1.

In addition, Nixon reversed an April 20 announcement that he would withdraw 150,000 troops from Vietnam over the next year, in effect providing that there would again be a need to draft young American men to maintain the current level. Despite appearances, Nixon told viewers \"This is not an invasion of Cambodia.\" Instead, Nixon explained, the attacks were upon territory in Cambodia that were \"completely occupied and controlled by North Vietnamese forces.\" By the time the President\\'s speech started at 9:00 in the evening Washington time, the U.S. operations in Cambodia had already been underway for two hours.

              " 'Samuel Bingham Endicott (born August 13, 1978) is an American singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, actor and director. He is best known as the lead vocalist of The Bravery with whom he recorded three studio albums. == Career == At age 11 Endicott began playing guitar and at 12 switched to bass guitar. By age 13 he was an established bass player in the Washington, D.C. area, playing in numerous punk and harDCore bands, most notably Stain, with Geoff Turner of Gray Matter and Colin Sears of Dag Nasty. He has stated that his biggest influence as a bass player is Joe Lally of Fugazi, and he initially sought to emulate Lally\\'s melodic style of playing.While attending Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York, Endicott was classmates with future Bravery keyboardist John Conway. The two began a musical partnership, playing together in various projects in the Poughkeepsie area. After graduating with B.A. in Psychology, Endicott and Conway moved to New York City, where their musical partnership continued. In 2003 he switched from bass guitar to vocals and began writing, recording and producing the music that would become the first Bravery album. Guitarist Michael Zakarin joined after answering an advert in a local paper, and brought with him bassist Mike Hindert, a classmate of his from Georgetown University in Washington, DC. Drummer Anthony Burulcich was living in Boston where he had studied percussion at Berklee College of Music. After the death of his sister, Burulcich moved back to his childhood home in Long Island New York to be with his family. On the day Burulcich was moving, while driving with his belongings in a U-Haul truck, Endicott called him. The Bravery went on to release their debut album in March 2005. Endicott is a multi-instrumentalist playing guitar, bass, vocals, keyboards and programs electronic drums and synthesizers. Endicott has also co-directed and written a number of the Bravery\\'s music videos, making his music video directing debut with the video for the Bravery\\'s \"Believe\" in 2008. He is also credited as producer on the Bravery\\'s debut album, as well as the \"Moon\" portion of their The Sun and the Moon Complete, described as an \"alternate take\" on their second release The Sun and the Moon. Endicott co-produced the Bravery\\'s third studio album Stir The Blood. While recording the Stir the Blood album, Endicott and producer John Hill co-wrote three songs with Shakira for her album She Wolf, including the single She Wolf and critically acclaimed song \"Men In This Town\". She Wolf and its Spanish version counterpart \"Loba,\" had major commercial success worldwide.Endicott, alongside Switch, Santigold, and John HIll also co-wrote the Christina Aguilera song \"Monday Morning\" for Aguilera\\'s album Bionic. Endicott also appears as an actor in the independent film Modern Romance. Endicott was featured on the February 2005 cover of L\\'oumo Vogue. Endicott was a feature model for the 2008 European Gap Campaign. Endicott formed a new band with friends called The Mercy Beat. The band released a three-song EP in 2014 which he has described as experimental punk soul. == Early life == === Background and education === Endicott grew up in Brookmont, Maryland. He is an only child of William Endicott and Abigail Bingham Endicott, a vocalist and teacher. Endicott attended Georgetown Day School before transferring to Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. He is a great-great-great-grandson of Charles Lewis Tiffany. He is a great-grandson of Hiram Bingham III. == Personal life == According to a November 2009 interview from the Spinner website, Endicott reported that he has synesthesia.

              " 'Ruben Lenten (born 30 March 1988) is a Dutch professional kite surfer who has won the Red Bull King of the Air in 2005. Ruben started kiteboarding at the age of 12 and quickly made a name for himself as a rider who was willing to push the sport hard and take that extra risk out on the water. For a number of years Ruben competed on the PKRA freestyle world tour with a second position overall in 2005 as his best ranking.Ruben was one of the first riders to try radical high-powered moves in gale force conditions, easily jumping over 15 m high. One of his signature moves has become the megaloop, where the kite is steered around in a tight circle while the rider is up really high in the air. (see photo link below) In recent years Ruben has moved away from the competition scene and focused on other projects like producing kiteboarding movies and creating and organizing new kiteboarding concepts and events like the LEN10 Megaloop challenge. Ruben was instrumental in developing a new competition format that caters more to the public, featuring an easy to follow scoring system and higher and more spectacular jumps. Ruben did take part in the 2014 and 2015 King of the Air competitions in South Africa. He came in third in 2014 but crashed hard in this years final, dislocating his hand in the aftermath. Together with other accomplished riders like Aaron Hadlow and Robby Naish Ruben is currently working on a project that strives to really put the kiteboarding industry on the map by making the biggest kiteboard movie to date. Ruben has worked with Aaron Hadlow in the past. Together they partnered with RedBull to make a web series called \"On the Loose\".

              " 'David Storr Unwin (3 December 1918 – 11 February 2010), known as David Severn, was a British writer. He was the son of publisher Sir Stanley Unwin, of whom Severn wrote a biography in 1982, Fifty Years with Father. He had Who\\'s Who entries throughout his writing career. Severn attended Abbotsholme School, Derbyshire, 1933–36, and worked for the League of Nations Secretariat, Geneva (1938), Unwin Brothers (printers), 1939, Blackwells (1940) and George Allen & Unwin (1941–43), having been declared medically unfit for the armed services. His first series for children (1942–46) featured \"Crusoe\" Robinson, who was befriended by youngsters in holiday adventures, many featuring a Romany group. The Warner family series followed (1947–52), featuring pheasants, ponies and country life. The scraperboard illustrations of Joan Kiddell-Monroe greatly enhance these two series. A number of books experimented with the paranormal and time-slip, and can be compared with many modern books revisiting supernatural themes. Drumbeats! has a musical youngster beating a native drum which transports children to a lost expedition to Africa twenty years earlier. Dream Gold shows the hypnotic power of one boy over another, with dreams reliving the conflicts of their ancestors. These are his most interesting books, and the ones he wished to be remembered by. The Future Took Us is a time-slip into 3,000 C.E. The Girl in the Grove, his longest book, is a psychological ghost story. He also produced illustrated books for younger children. Only his last three books were published by Allen & Unwin. == Books for children as David Severn == (Published in London by The Bodley Head unless indicated, selected titles in New York by Houghton Mifflin 1946–47 and thereafter Macmillan.

              " 'Paisean Faisean (\"Fashion Passion\") is an Irish language television dating show broadcast on TG4. It was presented in the first three series by Aoife Ní Thuairisg, and in the fourth series by Bláthnaid Nic Dhonnchadha and Mairéad Ní Chuaig. The fifth series saw Nic Dhonnchadha present alongside Síle Seoige. == Format == Magma films bought the format from Digital Rights Group with the line \"Boys buy clothes for girls\" from that Clodagh Freeman created the series. Magma films get a percentage of international rights as they bought the format from paper and brought it to the screen first. The format of the show traditionally involves three men choosing outfits for one woman – although the episode aired on 19 November 2007 featured four gay men. The suitors are shown a short pre-recorded clip of the girl, wearing jeans and a white T-shirt, in which she introduces herself and gives clues as to which clothes she likes. Each man shops in a different shop, and has €400 spending money (raised to €500 in the fourth season). The person for whom the outfits are purchased must then base her choice of \"date\" on which outfit she likes the best. The winning man and the woman then share dinner in a restaurant. Magma Films, producers of Paisean Faisean, have since sold the rights to Zoo Productions who will produce the series for MTV under the title Style Date. The show has also been produced in Turkey, while a Polish version is expected later on this year. == Controversies == === Advertising === In the show\\'s second season it raised some controversy, when complaints were upheld against two of its advertisements by the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland; a billboard advertisement depicting a woman in slightly revealing clothing led to complaints of \\'reducing women to mere sexual objects\\'; and a radio advertisement in which a woman complains about people being able to see her underwear, with the response \\'Not if you\\'re not wearing any, they won\\'t\\', led to complaints about sexual equality. Angela Kerins, Chair of the Equality Authority Board in Ireland came out strongly to confirm their condemnation of the advertisements. === Gay contestants === Series four included an episode with gay couples. Ní Thuairisg refused to film episodes featuring gay couples, claiming \"incompatibility with her religious beliefs\" (she is a Jehovah\\'s Witness); this may have contributed to her departure. == References == == External links == Official site on TG4.ie in Irish Official site on TG4.ie in English',\n",
              " 'The 1913 College Football All-America team is composed of college football players who were selected as All-Americans for the 1913 college football season. The only two selectors who have been recognized as \"official\" selectors by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) for the 1913 season are Walter Camp and the International News Service (INS). Camp\\'s All-America Team was published in Collier\\'s Weekly. The INS was founded in 1909 by William Randolph Hearst, and its sports editor Frank G. Menke selected the INS All-America team. Other sports writers, newspapers, coaches selecting All-America teams in 1913 included Harper\\'s Weekly, Fielding H. Yost, and Parke H. Davis. == Consensus All-Americans == In its official record book, the NCAA designates players who were selected by either Camp or INS as \"consensus\" All-Americans. Using this criteria, the NCAA recognizes 15 as \"consensus\" All-Americans for the 1913 season. The consensus players are identified in bold on the main list below (\"All-Americans of 1913\"). Camp and INS unanimously selected the following seven players as All-Americans: Charles Brickley, fullback for Harvard. Brickley later became a player and coach in the early years of professional football. He was the coach of the New York Brickley Giants in the first year of play in the National Football League. In 1928, he was convicted on four counts of larceny and bucketing orders from customers of his stock brokerage firm. John \"Babe\" Brown, guard for Navy. Brown was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1951 as part of the first group of inductees. During World War II, Admiral John Brown oversaw submarine operations in the South Pacific. He later served as athletics director at the United States Naval Academy. James Craig, halfback for Michigan. Craig was also one of the best hurdlers in the country, breaking the world indoor record in the high hurdles in 1911 and winning the intercollegiate championship in the low hurdles in 1912. His older brother, Ralph Craig, won gold medals in the 100 and 200-meter events at the 1912 Olympics. Paul Des Jardien, center for Chicago. At six feet, five inches in height, but weighing only 190 pounds, Des Jardien was nicknamed \"Shorty.\" He led the 1913 Chicago Maroons football team to an undefeated 7–0 record and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1955. Des Jardien was a multi-sport star who also briefly played professional baseball as a pitcher for the Cleveland Indians in 1916. Robert Hogsett, end for Dartmouth. Hogsett was the captain of the 1913 Dartmouth Big Green football team that compiled a 7–1–0 record and outscored opponents 218 to 79, including victories over Princeton and Penn. Eddie Mahan, halfback for Harvard. Mahan was selected as a first-team All-American three consecutive years from 1913 to 1915. He was widely regarded as one of the greatest players in the first 50 years of the sport and was named by Jim Thorpe as the greatest football player of all time. In 1951, Mahan was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame as part of the first group of inductees. Louis A. Merrilat, end for Army. Merrilat was a first-team All-American in both 1913 and 1914. He was severely wounded by airplane machine gun fire during World War I, but went on to play in the NFL as a 33-year-old rookie in 1925. He later became a soldier of fortune, training Iran\\'s Persian Guard, working with the Chinese Army in the 1930s, and serving in the French Foreign Legion. == All-Americans of 1913 == === Ends === Robert Hogsett, Dartmouth (WC–1; INS-1; MFP-2; SBH-1; TET-1) Louis A.

              " 'Miss (pronounced ) is an English language honorific typically used for a girl, for an unmarried woman (when not using another title such as \"Doctor\" or \"Dame\"), or for a married woman retaining her maiden name. Originating in the 17th century, it is a contraction of mistress. Its counterparts are Mrs., used for a married women who has taken her husband\\'s name, and Ms., which can be used for married or unmarried women. The plural Misses may be used, such as in The Misses Doe. The traditional French \"Mademoiselle\" (abbreviation \"Mlle\") may also be used as the plural in English language conversation or correspondence. In Australian, British, and Irish schools the term \\'miss\\' is often used by pupils in addressing any female teacher. == Use alone as a form of address == Miss is an honorific for addressing a woman who is not married, and is known by her maiden name. It is a shortened form of mistress, and departed from misses/missus which became used to signify marital attachment in the 18th and 19th centuries. It does not imply age, though youth corresponds (as marriage implies adulthood). == Racial discrimination and the term Miss == Being addressed with \"Miss\" or \"Mrs.\" was frequently denied to black women in the Southern United States in the past. Mary Hamilton, a civil rights protester arrested in 1963 in Gadsden, Alabama, refused to answer the prosecutor in a subsequent hearing unless he stopped addressing her as \"Mary\", demanding that instead she be called \"Miss Hamilton\". She was subsequently jailed for contempt of court after refusing to pay a fine. This led to Hamilton v. Alabama, 376 U.S. 650 (1964), a United States Supreme Court case in which the court held that Mary Hamilton was entitled to the same courteous forms of address customarily reserved solely for whites in the Southern United States and that calling a black person by their first name in a formal context was \"a form of racial discrimination\". == See also == Fräulein (German-language term for Miss, gained popularity due to the Fräuleinwunder, lit.

              " 'Kira is a mostly feminine name of multiple origins and meanings. The feminine form is pronounced KEER-ə or KEE-rə. It might be a feminine form of the name Kiran, pronounced KEER-ən. Kiran is of Hindi and Sanskrit origin, meaning \"beam of light\". In Ancient Hebrew \"Keren\" means both \"a horn\" and \"a beam of light\". Besides Sanskrit and Hebrew there might be other etymologies from Egyptian, where the word Ki-Ra means \"like Ra\", or Persian. Due to the Greek interpretation of the Persian king\\'s name Kourosh (کوروش, Kūrosh) as Κύρος (Kýros) – which was obviously modeled after the Greek word κύριος (kýrios \"lord\"), the feminine form being κυρία (kyría) – Kyra (or Kira) can also be understood as a variant. Therefore, it is also in use as a feminine form of the Greek diminutive form Cyril. In Russian Kira (Ки́ра) is the feminine form of the masculine name Kir, meaning \"mistress, ruler\", but can translate to \"leader of the people\", \"one the people look to\" or \"beloved\". Kira could also have arrived into Russian from the Persian-Greek name Kyra. Kira can also be the diminutive of the old and rare masculine given name Avvakir.Kira is one of several Anglicized forms of the Irish name Ciara, which in Irish means \"dark haired\".Kira also means \"Strong Woman\" in Slavonic. There is also a Japanese name, romanized as Kira, which is common in Japan, as both given name and family name (e.g. the Kira clan of Mikawa province). Kira kira also means \"glittery, shiny\" in Japanese.Variant forms include Kaira, Keera, Keira, Kiera, Kyra, Kyrah, Kyreena, Kyrha, Kyria, Kyrie, Kyrene, Kyrra, and Kirra. == People == Kira Banasińska (1899-2002), Polish humanitarian Kira Bertrand (born 1992), Dominican-Canadian footballer Kira Bilecky (born 1986), American-Peruvian footballer Kira Bousloff (1914-2001), Russian-Australian dancer Kira Brunton (born 1999), Canadian curler Kira Buckland (born 1987), American voice actress Kira Bulten (born 1973), Dutch Olympic swimmer Kira Bursky, American filmmaker Kira Carstensen, American documentary filmmaker Kira Chathli (born 1999), English cricketer Kira Chikazane (1563-1588), Japanese senior retainer Kira Cochrane (born 1977), British journalist Kira Davis, American film producer Kira Danganan-Azucena, Filipino diplomat Kira Eggers (born 1974), Danish model Kira Geil (born 1985), Austrian ice dancer Kira Golovko (1919–2017), Russian actress Kira Nam Greene, Korean-American painter Kira Grünberg (born 1993), Austrian politician Kira Hagi (born 1996), Romanian actress Kira Hall (born 1962), American anthropologist Kira Lynn Harris (born 1963), American artist Kira Henehan (born 1974), American author Kira Horn (born 1995), German field hockey player Kira Hurley (born 1986), Canadian professional ice hockey player Kira Inugami, Japanese manga artist Kira Isabella (born 1993), Canadian country music artist Kira Ivanova (1963–2001), Russian figure skater Kira Jääskeläinen (born 1979), Polish film director Kira Kattenbeck (born 1992), German badminton player Kira Kazantsev (born 1991), Russian-American beauty queen Kira Kelly, American cinematographer Kiira Korpi, Finnish skater (Kiira is a Finnish variant of the name) Kira Kosarin (born 1997), American actress Kira Kovalenko (born 1989), Russian film director Kira Kreylis-Petrova (1931–2021), Russian theater actress Kira Lewis Jr. (born 2001), American basketball player Kira Lipperheide (born 2000), German bobsledder Kira Makarova, Estonian-American researcher Kira Maria, Bulgarian empress consort Kira Miró (born 1980), Spanish actress and a presenter Kira Mozgalova (born 1982), Russian Olympic athlete Kira Muratova (born 1934), Soviet and Ukrainian film director, screenwriter, and actress Kira Nagy (born 1977), Hungarian tennis player Kira Narayanan (born 1994), Indian film actress Kira Obolensky, American playwright and author Kira O\\'Reilly, British performance artist Kira Peikoff (born 1985), American journalist Kira Marie Peter-Hansen (born 1998), Danish politician Kira Phillips (born 1995), Australian rules footballer Kira Peikoff (born 1985), American journalist and novelist Kira Plastinina (born 1992), Russian fashion designer Kira Poutanen (born 1974), Finnish writer and actress Kira Borisovna Povarova (born 1933), Russian professor Kira Puru, Australian musician Kira Radinsky (born 1986), Israeli computer scientist Kira Reed (born 1971), American actress Kira Roessler (born 1962), American musician Grand Duchess Kira Kirillovna of Russia (1909–1967), Russian grand duchess Kira Rudik (born 1985), Ukrainian politician Princess Kira of Prussia (1943–2004) Kira Salak (born 1971), American writer Kira Shashkina, Russian pianist Kira Simon-Kennedy, American film producer Kira Skov (born 1976), Danish singer Kira Soltanovich (born 1973), Ukrainian comedian Kira Stepanova (born 1993), Russian Olympic athlete Kira Sugiyama (1910–1988), Japanese photographer Kira Thurman, African-American historian Kira Toussaint (born 1994), Dutch swimmer Kira Tozer (born 1984), Canadian voice actress Kira Trusova (born 1994), Russian handball player Kira Vincent-Davis (born 1979), American voice actress Kira Walkenhorst (born 1990), German beach volleyball player Kira Weidle (born 1996), German alpine skier Kira Willey, American musician Kira Yarmysh (born 1989), Russian writer Kira Yoshinaka (1641-1703), Japanese politician Kira Zvorykina (1919–2014), Soviet and Ukrainian chess player == Fictional characters == Kira Argounova, the protagonist in Ayn Rand\\'s We the Living Kira Aso, female protagonist in the Japanese manga Mars Kira Carsen in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic Kira Daidohji in the video game series Arcana Heart Kira Finster in the Nickelodeon animated television series Rugrats and its spin-off All Grown Up!

              " 'Marianne Christine Stang Ihlen (Norwegian: [mɑrɪˈɑ̂nːə ˈîːln̩]; 18 May 1935 – 28 July 2016) was a Norwegian woman who was the first wife of author Axel Jensen and later the muse and girlfriend of Leonard Cohen for several years in the 1960s. She was the subject of Cohen\\'s 1967 song \"So Long, Marianne\". == Early life == Ihlen was born on 18 May 1935 in Larkollen, Norway, the elder of the two children of Ingeborg Louise (née Kloed, 29 April 1909 – 5 September 2003) and Nils Ihlen (27 October 1906 – 16 November 1959). Known as “Mosse”, her mother was the daughter of opera singer Wilhelm Cappelle Kloed and had had a privileged childhood, including having been sent to Paris to learn French. Ihlen was raised in Oslo where her father was a lawyer. During the Second World War Ihlen\\'s father contracted tuberculosis which required a long period of treatment at the Mesnali sanatorium near Lillehammer. Her younger brother, Nils, when he was two suffered from tuberculosis for more than a year during which while her mother nursed her son and husband Ihlen spent time with her maternal grandmother in Larkollen.As the 1950s progressed the family’s financial situation became strained as Ihlen’s father lacked the lung capacity as a result of his tuberculosis treatment to work for an entire day in court. This put pressure on the couple’s relationship and forced her mother to take a job in the licence office of the national broadcasting company. Ihlen attended Berle Girls’ School. == Meets Axel Jensen == While her father had hoped that she would become a doctor or lawyer, Ihlen did not know what she wanted to do, so opted to take business studies at the Oslo Municipal Trade School. Graduating at the age of 19 Ihlen took a number of jobs, including as secretary at an attorney’s office in Oslo, Kristiania Shoe Store, the Norsk Bygdekino cinema, and in 1956 at the Save the Children charitable organization. She also briefly worked as an au pair in Newcastle, in England.In 1954, while travelling in a car with one of her girlfriends along Majorstua Street, they were approached by budding 22 year old Norwegian avant-garde writer Axel Jensen, who invited her to a party. Once at the party Ihlen thought he was fascinating and was spellbound by everything he said. Jensen subsequently telephoned her and they met up in Dovrehallen, a student pub at which they committed to a relationship. Jensen took whatever work he could find to support himself as he wrote short stories for newspapers and magazines. He introduced Ihlen to works by Nietzsche, Carl Jung and Ouspensky in an effort to expand her horizons. In 1955, Jensen self-published his first book Dyretemmerens kors. Ihlen clashed with her father over Jensen, curfews, and housework, and when she was twenty he refused her permission to spend Easter with Jensen and their friends in a mountain cabin. Her father thought that Jensen, who came from a broken home, lacked a good education, a job and a place of his own to live, unlike the children of his middle class friends and acquaintances. When she was 22, Ihlen was inspired while reading Henrik Ibsen’s The Wild Duck with her mother’s cousin who was an actress, to also become an actress. She then studied to take the entrance examination to the National Academy of Theatre in Oslo, but lost her nerve partly due to her parents\\' objections and did not take the examination.In 1957, Jensen’s novel Ikaros – ung mann i Sahara (Icarus – A Young Man in Sahara) was published by Henrik Groth of Cappelen, and was highly praised. Ihlen thought they had a committed relationship with long held plans to travel to Greece, but later that same year, one evening, Jensen out of the blue introduced her to another young woman at the Theatre Café, and informed Ihlen that there would be no trip to Greece as he was leaving tomorrow with the other woman for Egypt. Ihlen stormed out and made her way in a state of shock back to where she was staying, only to be awakened at 4 o’clock by Jensen at the doorstep saying, “We’re going to Greece! It’s you I want to travel with!” == Hydra == In mid-November, over her parents’ objections, the reunited couple departed by train for Greece, with plans to be away for a year, with Jensen intending to spend the time writing. Disembarking from the train in Hamburg, they purchased a second-hand Volkswagen Beetle. Driving south they visited Venice and Rome before passing through Yugoslavia into Greece. On the way south from Thessaloniki, Ihlen was forced to have an emergency operation for appendicitis in the village of Lamia. Ihlen remained in hospital for a week recovering, and it was not until December that they reached Athens, where they stayed with their friends Per and Else Berit who had moved there the year before. Jensen had originally intended that they rent an apartment in Athens, but their friends suggested they could live more cheaply on the island of Hydra, which was three hours away by ferry. After visiting Delphi the couple drove down to Erminoni in the Peloponnese, where their landlady at the place they stayed allowed them to park their car in her garden. It was from there that they took a ferry to Hydra.After initially renting, Jensen used part of an advance of 40,000 kroner that he had received from Groth for his next book to purchase a house on Kala Pigadia Street on Hydra for approximately US$2,500. After making repairs to the house, the couple were left with just over US$2,000 on which to live on until Jensen’s next book was published, with the house offered as security for one year’s line of credit at a local grocery store.The house was simple with an outside toilet and electricity for only one hour in the evening and one hour in the morning. Otherwise, they used paraffin lamps. The couple soon became a component part of the foreign community on the island, and friends with Charmian Clift and her husband, novelist George Johnston. Some months later the Swedish writer Göran Tunström arrived on the island and rented a house close by, becoming a friend. Ihlen remained on Hydra when it was necessary for Jensen to travel back several times to Norway to capitalise on the success of his novel, Ikaros – ung mann i Sahara.On one of these trips Jensen met a woman called Sonja, who he became besotted with after five days of acquaintance. Upon his return to Hydra in late 1958, he informed Ihlen that the woman was coming to the island and that his relationship with her was over. In response Ihlen packed a bag and left to stay in Athens for a few days, with the idea of getting a job there.She was approached by Eileen Barclay who was married to Sam Barclay, an heir to Barclays Bank. They had a schooner, the Stromie Seas, which they chartered out to wealthy individuals over the summer. Eileen was eager to have a break from her position as cook and hostess on the yacht and spend time with her new lover. She suggested that Ihlen replace her on the schooner where she could also be a nanny for the couple’s seven-year-old son. The next day she reported to Barclay at Piraeus, and spent the next six weeks working on the schooner as it sailed among various Greek islands, including Santorini. Thrown together, Barclay and Ihlen had a romantic relationship during this period.At the end of the charter Ihlen returned to stay with Per and Else Berit in Athens, who observed that the experience had transformed her into a serene and more-confident person, who, while she still loved Jensen, was prepared to live without him.Meanwhile Jensen had been on a six week long drinking binge as he had purchased a ticket for Sonja to travel to join him in Greece, only to find that she had sold the ticket and had kept the money. == Marriage == By chance, while Jensen was in Athens he met the \"new\" Marianne, falling in love with her again. He immediately asked her to marry him and she accepted. They married on 22 October 1958 in the Anglican Church in Athens, against her parents\\' wishes. They then returned to their house on Hydra. While Jensen had by now delivered the first draft of his novel to Cappelen, to bring in extra money both Ihlen and Jensen worked over the spring of 1959 on Sam Barclay’s schooner as it carried a group of English students around the Greek islands. With his new novel Line, printed and approaching its publishing date, both Ihlen (who was by now pregnant) and Jensen travelled to Oslo, where both were able to catch up with family and friends. Once the novel was published to great acclaim, Jensen used the incoming money to travel in October with Ihlen, Per and Else Brent to Stockholm, where via friends they purchased a Karmann Ghia. Due to Jensen being unable to drive due to a drunk driving conviction, Ihlen drove the car back to Oslo. It was while they were back in Oslo that Ihlen’s father died of kidney failure in November 1959. Ihlen’s son Axel Joachim was born on 21 January 1960 in Oslo. Ihlen temporarily moved in with her mother, as a week after his son’s birth Jensen travelled back to Hydra in order to avoid paying Norwegian taxes. Four months later Ihlen and Axel Joachim followed. == Leonard Cohen == While Ihlen had been in Norway, Leonard Cohen had moved to Hydra, renting a house for US$14 a month. While he had noticed her following her return, they had never been introduced. Ihlen described their meeting in Katsikas’ store in early 1960: I was standing in a shop with my basket waiting to pick up bottled water and milk. And I was crying in front of a Greek lady. Then, there he was (Cohen) standing in the door way with the sun behind him, and you don’t see the face, just the contours, and so I hear his voice saying ‘would you like to join us? Come into the sun. We’re sitting outside’. He was wearing a beautiful little sixpence (sikspens) cap. When my eyes met his, I felt it throughout my body. After finishing her shopping Ihlen joined Cohen and three or four other foreigners at a table outside for a period before returning home. By now Ihlen was aware that her husband had a new lover, the American painter Patricia Amlin, who he was openly carrying on with.With their relationship deteriorating, Jensen decided to leave on his sailboat, a BBII that he had had transported by ship to Piraeus. A friend, while visiting Athens, reported back to Ihlen that he had seen Jensen and Amlin together, which finally convinced her that her marriage was finished. Jensen later confirmed in a May 1960 letter to her that he had left Hydra by himself rather than openly with Amlin, in order to spare Ihlen the public humiliation. Rather than return to Norway, Ihlen decided to stay on Hydra with her baby son, partly due to her deepening friendship with Cohen.Soon after Ihlen’s and Jensen’s separation, Amlin was badly injured when she crashed Jensen’s Karmann Ghia near Athens and was flung out of the car, breaking many bones and developing gangrene, which required amputation of a thumb. Jensen struggled with the situation and three days later telegrammed Ihlen asking for her help. At Cohen’s urging, Ihlen left her son with him and travelled to Athens, where she maintained a vigil by Amlin’s bed allowing Jensen to rest. After three days she returned to Hydra. After Jensen left her, Ihlen received small financial payments from Jensen’s publisher, Cappelen. Jensen allowed her to live in the house and following their formal divorce a year later transferred ownership to her and their son. After taking Amlin back to America and travelling around Mexico with John Starr Cooke, Jensen returned to Hydra in the summer of 1960 and rented a house in which to write. Jensen remained friendly with both Ihlen and Cohen. Eventually Jensen was expelled from Hydra in 1962 following a drunken altercation with a policeman, after which Ihlen never saw him again, though they continued to correspond.The Karmann Ghia had survived Amlin’s crash practically undamaged. It had been registered in Ihlen’s name, but there was a need for it to be returned to Norway in order to avoid having to pay import duties, which Ihlen would struggle to pay. She was reluctant to make the long journey with her son. As Cohen’s money was running out and he needed to return to Canada to make some more, he offered to accompany her, before continuing across the Atlantic. Plans changed when by chance Ihlen came across some SAS Norwegian aircrew while they were relaxing in Hydra. Believing them to be trustworthy, she impulsively asked if they would take her six month son back to his grandmother in Oslo, rather than him having to endure a long drive across Europe. They agreed and in August a few days later Ihlen and Cohen delivered the baby to the aircrew at Athens airport. After receiving a telegram from her mother that her son had arrived safely, Ihlen and Cohen returned to Hydra where in September of that year, having received an inheritance from his grandmother, Cohen purchased a whitewashed L-shaped house for US$1,500. Ihlen divided her time between her house and Cohen’s, though they took small breaks to explore the mainland together. In November 1960 Ihlen and Cohen drove to Norway, exploring Europe as they went. Cohen then travelled on from Oslo to Canada. Ihlen signed her legal separation papers in February 1961, though her divorce would not be finalised for another year. To support herself she took a job as production assistant and substitute script girl on the film Tonny released in 1962. Cohen eventually scraped together sufficient funds and sent Ihlen a telegram in the autumn of 1961: “Have house. All I need is my woman and her son. Love Leonard.”She and her by now 18-month-old son joined him in Montreal, where Cohen increasingly became a surrogate father to Axel Joachim. The three lived in Montreal for one year before returning to Hydra in 1963. While she had been away Ihlen had rented out the house on Kala Pigadia Street, which she returned to live in before soon moving in with Cohen. They engaged an elderly neighbour Kyria Sophia to help around the house while Cohen wrote, and Ihlen looked after her son and Cohen. Ihlen and Cohen grew their own marijuana with Ihlen occasionally mixing it into meatballs.After two years of work, Cohen completed his novel The Favourite Game, which was published in October 1963. Leaving her son with his grandmother before he joined her, Ihlen spent a couple of months in Paris where she tried to obtain work before travelling on to Oslo to attend the funeral of her paternal grandmother. Meanwhile Cohen had been in London and Canada, returning to Hydra where once again he created a family unit with Ihlen and her son. Cohen attempted to gain a living through his writing while his muse was a housewife and lover. Ihlen occasionally modelled for Hydra based artists, among them Anthony Kingsmill and Marcelle Maltais, whose painting of her resides in the Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec.Cohen returned to Montreal for a short period before he obtained passage on a cargo ship and re-joined Ihlen, who was then visiting Oslo. Cohen wrote to his friend Irving Layton that Ihlen: ... seems to have endured and ruined the women I ‘ve known after her and I’ve got to confront her mystery in the snow. She is so blonde in my heart! Once the couple were back on Hydra Cohen commenced work in 1964 on his second novel Beautiful Losers. During this writing period he would often leave Ihlen on Hydra while he returned to Canada for short periods to work and replenish his funds, as well as provide readings of his poetry. The only time they travelled as a family was a short trip to London in the spring of 1965. By the time Beautiful Losers was published in 1966 to disappointing sales and initially unsympathetic reviews, Cohen had come to the realisation that he would not be able to make a living as a writer. At the same time his relationship with Ihlen had become strained, due to the time he had spent away from her in Hydra. To improve their relationship, the couple moved to Montreal together with Ihlen’s son where they took up residence in an apartment at 3657 Aylmer Street. Ihlen was able to obtain a job in a woman’s clothing boutique on Sainte Catherine Street. By this time folk music was becoming popular, especially in New York. On visits to the city, Cohen had heard both Bob Dylan and Joan Baez perform. After some time back in Montreal, Cohen decided to head south in search of work as a studio musician in Nashville. While passing through New York he was introduced to singer Judy Collins, who after hearing some of his songs encouraged him to continue. By now having run out of money, he returned to Ihlen in Montreal, instead of continuing on to Nashville. It was back in Montreal that Cohen wrote Suzanne, which was taken up by Collins and became his first successful song. Deciding in the winter of 1966 that she needed a break from Cohen, Ihlen took Axel Joachim along on a visit to her friend John Starr Cooke near Oaxaca in Mexico. It was here that for the only time in her life Ihlen tried a few LSD trips, in an attempt to provide some insight into her dilemmas.Believed that its unstructured regime would be beneficial, Ihlen sent seven year old Axel Joachim to board at experimental Summerhill School in England. There were children of a number of other Hydra expats there. However Axel Joachim was unmoored by the experience, and became desperate for his mother. He spent a year or two there. He then had no further real schooling until at the age of 12 he was sent to a strict Swiss boarding school.In 1968, while living alone on Hydra, Ihlen met 20-year-old Nick Broomfield, with whom she had a nearly year-long relationship, during which she was instrumental in encouraging him to become a documentary maker and to make his first film, Who Cares? in 1971.Axel Joachim returned to his mother and was nine years old when the pair moved to New York where Cohen was then based, with Ihlen hoping to re-establish their relationship. Cohen would not allow her to stay. He claimed that he considered her too pure, and wished to shield her and her son from his current debauched, bohemian lifestyle. Consequently, Ihlen established a separate residence with her friend Carol Zemel who had recently moved to the city on Clinton Street on the Lower East Side. Ihlen and her old friend Jean Marc Appert earned money as street vendors of toy cats, made on the spot out of steel wire and wool yarn. Cohen and Ihlen remained close, with him paying her rent and her son\\'s boarding schools in England and Switzerland as well as his airfare. He took her for visits to the Chelsea Hotel, and to concerts, and introduced her to Andy Warhol, Joni Mitchell and Buffy Sainte-Marie. As Cohen’s fame increased, other women would ring Ihlen’s apartment in an attempt to get to him. While they drifted apart as lovers, Cohen would continue to support Ihlen and provide whatever help he could. Their relationship finally ended in 1972 after the birth of Cohen\\'s son Adam, who was born from his relationship with Suzanne Elrod. While in the city Ihlen undertook a body-oriented psychotherapy with psychotherapist Alexander Lowen. After a year in New York, Ihlen and her son left to divide their time between her family’s home in Larkollen and Hydra. While living in Cohen’s house in Hydra in 1972 with her by now 12-year-old Axel Joachim, she was confronted by Suzanne Elrod with her son Adam Cohen. Elrod wanted the house for herself, so Ihlen was forced to move out. == Return to Norway == In 1973 Ihlen returned with her son to live a permanent, more structured life in Oslo, though she and Cohen stayed in touch periodically for the rest of her life. Whenever he performed in Scandinavia, she visited him backstage. When either of them spoke of their love affair, it was always in the fondest terms.Ihlen took a position with Norwegian Contractors, who specialized in the construction of offshore oil platforms, where she worked in the personnel and foreign departments. She remained employed in the oil industry for the rest of her working life. Axel Joachim was taken on a trip to India at the age of 15 by his father, Jensen, and given LSD. As he grew older, he developed psychiatric problems and after 1979 spent a large part of his life institutionalized in Norway. The 2020 documentary Little Axel explored his life. While employed at Norwegian Contractors Ihlen met engineer Jan Kielland Stang, who had three daughters from a previous marriage and whom she knew from her youth. They married in 1979. Following their marriage they continued to live in Oslo.Ihlen continued to regularly visit Hydra for holidays. Late in her working life, Ihlen assisted actress Juni Dahr by making travel arrangements for her when she toured her solo shows Joan of Arc - Vision through Fire and then Ibsen Women - Put an Eagle in a Cage in Europe, Japan and the United States in the late 1980s and early 1990s. She developed an interest in Tibetan Buddhism via the Centre for Growth in Denmark and spent time painting. == Illness and death == She was diagnosed with leukemia in late July 2016. Her close friend Jan Christian Mollestad contacted Cohen to tell him Ihlen was dying. Leonard Cohen penned a poignant final letter to her, which is often misquoted by the media and others. However, the widely circulated version of the letter was based on an inaccurate verbal recollection by Mollestad which was then transcribed in a radio interview. The actual letter (actually an email) obtained through the Leonard Cohen estate reads: Dearest Marianne, I’m just a little behind you, close enough to take your hand. This old body has given up, just as yours has too. I’ve never forgotten your love and your beauty. But you know that. I don’t have to say any more. Safe travels old friend. See you down the road. Endless love and gratitude. your Leonard She died aged 81 on 28 July 2016, in Oslo. Cohen died later that year on 7 November 2016. == Legacy == Cohen dedicated his third volume of poetry, Flowers for Hitler, to Ihlen with the poems For Marianne and Waiting for Marianne, deal specifically with her. Cohen’s 1972 volume of poetry The Energy of Slaves also refers to Ihlen in Welcome Home. She also directly inspired many of his songs, in particular Bird on the Wire, Hey, That\\'s No Way to Say Goodbye and So Long, Marianne on his first two albums, Songs of Leonard Cohen (1967) and Songs from a Room (1969). The back sleeve of Songs from a Room features a famous photograph of her at Cohen\\'s typewriter, draped in a white towel in their house on Hydra.From a window in that home, Ihlen once saw a bird perched on a newly installed telephone wire and remarked to Cohen that they looked like musical notes; she suggested he write a song about it. Bird on the Wire was the result, one of his most successful songs, with the opening lines: Like a bird on the wire, Like a drunk in a midnight choir, I have tried, in my way, to be free. About his song So Long, Marianne Cohen commented on the back cover of Greatest Hits, 1976: I began this on Aylmer Street in Montreal and finished it a year or so later at the Chelsea Hotel in New York. I didn’t think I was saying goodbye but I guess I was. She gave me many songs, and she has given songs to others too. She is a Muse. A lot of people I know think that there is nothing more important than making a song. Fortunately, this belief arises infrequently in their conversation. Initially, the title line read “Come on, Marianne” and was meant as an invitation to allow changes in their lives. Even before the separation from Ihlen, Cohen replaced the encouraging “come on” with the farewell greeting “so long”. The song \"Moving On\" from Cohen\\'s posthumous 2019 album Thanks for the Dance is also a tribute to Ihlen.Norwegian journalist Kari Hesthamar won the 2006 Prix Europa for her 2005 radio documentary about Ihlen. In 2008, Hesthamar published her biography of Ihlen, So Long, Marianne. Ei Kjærleikshistorie; ECW Press published the English translation So Long, Marianne: A Love Story in 2014.In 2014, in a review of Lana Del Rey\\'s third album, Ultraviolence, Alexandra Molotkow compared Del Rey\\'s persona of surrender to Ihlen\\'s account of her search for independence. Molotkow described Del Rey as an artist, fully in control of her career, who, paradoxically, had chosen a performing persona as a weak and helpless female, who sought to surrender to powerful men. According to Molotkow, who had just read Hesthamar\\'s recently translated biography of Ihlen, even though Ihlen had the reality of the fantasy Del Rey shows in her videos, of the woman socially and economically reliant on a man, Ihlen has described how she became fully independent. According to Molotkow, Hesthamar\\'s book is \"the story of a remarkable woman who was a muse – who has, until now, appeared in history as a man’s idea – and how she found herself. Often, the book reads as a caution against giving up your power.\" Her life and relationship with Cohen was depicted in Nick Broomfield’s 2019 documentary film Marianne & Leonard: Words of Love. In June 2019 a collection of more than 50 love letters written by Leonard Cohen to Ihlen were sold at auction by Christie’s for $876,000 with many selling for more than five times their pre-sale estimates. One letter sold for $56,250.Ihlen was a character in Polly Samson’s 2020 novel A Theatre for Dreamers about the bohemian circle on Hydra in the 1960s. == Notes == == References == == Further reading == Genoni, Paul; Dalziell, Tanya (2018).

              " 'Libya–Spain relations are the bilateral and diplomatic relations between these two countries. Libya has an embassy in Madrid, and Spain has one in Tripoli. == Diplomatic relations == First contacts between the Kingdom of Libya and Francoist Spain after the 1951 Libyan independence began to develop after King Idris paid a visit to Spain in 1953.By means of the exchange of ambassadors, Spain and Libya established full diplomatic relations on 14 January 1961. Cooperation in the energy sector ensued.Following the 1969 coup d\\'etat in Libya and the ascension of Muammar Gaddafi to power, a pragmatic Spain had no problem to continue with the ongoing relations, in the overarching frame of Spanish neutrality towards the struggle between Conservative Arab monarchies and Pan-Arabist rulers taking place within the Arab League, although it did not take long for disagreements to emerge between the two countries over the timetable for the Spanish decolonisation of Western Sahara, and Libya eventually came to provide financial funding to the Polisario Front after 1973.Nonetheless, a 1972 visit to Libya by Spanish Foreign Minister Gregorio López Bravo consolidated existing relations, confirming Libya as a leading energy provider, a circumstance that eventually proved to be a major coup for the Spanish diplomacy in the context of the oil embargo by Arab countries (and ensuing energy crisis) on many Western countries on the wake of Israeli victory in the Yom Kippur War in 1973.Relations were strained in the 1980s, and there were various Libyan interference attempts in Spanish domestic politics, by providing logistic support to a number of political groups. Gadaffi had expected the new PSOE government to remove Spain from NATO membership after it came to power in 1982 and, shortly afterwards the 1986 referendum on the matter, he threatened Spain and Italy with military retaliation in case Libya was attacked.In 2004 a timid normalization of Libya\\'s relations with the international community began. In 2011 Spain was one of the first countries to position itself in favor of the 17 February revolution, actively supporting it in the political and humanitarian assistance fields. In the political arena, Spain recognized in March 2011 the Transitional National Council, provisional government, and a month later moved a special envoy to Benghazi; he was a member of the \"Group of friends of Libya\" and participated in the operation of NATO in defense of the Libyan people. The Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation, Trinidad Jiménez, traveled to Benghazi in June 2011, when military conflict had not yet come to an end. After the beginning of the political transition in Libya, Spain has sought to relaunch bilateral relations by showing its willingness to accompany Libya in the democratization process. With this objective, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation José Manuel García-Margallo, accompanied by the Minister of Development Ana Pastor, visited Tripoli on 16 and 17 December 2012 to convey a message of support from the Spanish government to the new Libyan authorities, and to boost economic and business relations between the countries.After 2014, the Spanish diplomatic mission to Libya operated from Tunisia. On 3 June 2021, on the wake of his official visit to Libya to endorse the process for political transition and reconstruction in the country, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez met with provisional Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh (GNU) and presided over the re-opening of the embassy in Tripoli (which would facilitate the issuance of Schengen visas to Libyan citizens). == Cooperation == Spain was the fifth European donor in humanitarian aid during the Libyan revolution of 2011, contributing more than 7 million euros. The process of political and social changes in Libya and other countries in the wake of the Arab Spring in January–February 2011 has led to a reformulation of the development cooperation policy in the region focusing on the accompaniment of the processes of democratic change. The Masar Program is a Spanish Cooperation program initiated in June 2012, whose purpose is to accompany democratic governance processes in the Arab World, contributing to the modernization and strengthening of institutions and of the key actors in the development of the rule of law, so that public authorities can respond to the needs of their societies, and civil society can be one of the engines of change.The strategic objective of Spanish cooperation in Libya is to contribute to strengthening the country\\'s capacities in its process of reconstruction and political transition. In 2012, Spain financed a demining program of the MAG NGO and the electoral assistance program of the United Nations Mission in Libya. Within the framework of the Masar program, Libya\\'s Deputy Minister of Justice of Libya, Sahar Banoon, traveled to Spain on 17 June 2013 together with a delegation from his ministry to learn about the Spanish prison system with a view to starting collaboration on prison reform in Libya.The promotion of exchanges at the institutional, business and civil society level between Spain and Libya is one of the main aspects of Spanish cooperation through study visits to Spanish institutions and participation in conferences and seminars organized by institutions such as Casa Árabe, Casa Mediterráneo, and Club de Madrid.In the cultural field, the promotion of Spanish culture and language stands out, with the creation of a Spanish reading place at the University of Tripoli in the 2013–2014 academic year. == See also == Foreign relations of Libya Foreign relations of Spain == References == Citations BibliographyJurado Anaya, Jesús (2012). \"Estudios de caso de la política exterior española hacia el Mundo Árabe y Musulmán: Libia\".

              " 'Christopher William Darwin (born 16 March 1961 in London) is an environmentalist and nature conservationist who lives in Australia and works on his goal of halting the global mass extinction of species. He is the ambassador of the charity Bush Heritage Australia. He is the great-great-grandson of Charles Darwin. == Biography == Darwin was born in 1961 in London. He is the son of George Erasmus Darwin, a metallurgist, known as \"Erasmus\", and his wife Shuna (née Service). He has an older brother Robert George Darwin and a younger sister, Sarah Darwin Vogel, a evolutionary biologist. He is descended from Charles Darwin via Charles\\'s son George Howard Darwin (1845-1912) a astronomer, his son William Robert Darwin (1894-1970), a stockbroker and brother of the physicist Charles Galton Darwin, and his wife Sarah Monica (née Slingsby) were the parents of George Erasmus Darwin (1927-).Ironically, given his famous ancestor, Darwin struggled with biology in his school years, failing the biology A-level. He later graduated from Oxford Polytechnic (latterly Oxford Brookes University) with a Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology and Geography. In 1983 he started London’s first bicycle rickshaw taxi service, and in 1984 was official photographer and assistant organiser for the first Round Britain Windsurf Expedition. The book Round Britain Windsurf by Tim Batstone, features Darwin\\'s photographs. He worked in advertising and television commercial production in the United Kingdom before emigrating to Australia in 1986.In 1991, he co-authored (with John Amy) the book The Social Climbers. In 1995, he co-edited (also with John Amy), The Ultimate Australian Adventure Guide. Darwin is married to Jacqui and has three children, Ali, Erasmus (Ras), and Monty. They live in the Blue Mountains west of Sydney, New South Wales, where Chris works in nature conservation. == Charitable work == Darwin co-authored (with John Amy) the book The Social Climbers. Written about a 1989 event in which Darwin and a group of seven other friends held a dinner party on top of Mount Huascaran in Peru, the book raised money for the National Heart Foundation. The dinner party itself set a world record for the \"highest formal dinner party on Earth.\"In 2003, Darwin made a donation to the Bush Heritage Australia charity to help purchase the Charles Darwin Reserve in Western Australia. The 65,000 hectare reserve is intended to preserve plant species. In 2009 he became an ambassador for Bush Heritage Australia. == Public appearances and opinions == In 2005 Chris, along with other descendants of Charles Darwin, including his father, sister, and various cousins, were involved in counting the flowers at Down House. He was also the guest of honour at a dinner celebrating the Darwin bicentenary at Melbourne Museum.Darwin believes that teaching children creationism is acceptable, despite his own lack of religious faith. He believes that it is \"important that children think through what is told to them and come to their own conclusions.\" == See also == Darwin–Wedgwood family == References ==',\n",
              " 'Dawn is a science fiction novel by American writer Dean McLaughlin. A re-imagining of Isaac Asimov\\'s 1941 short story \"Nightfall\", it was serialized in Analog magazine (April – July 1981), with two cover illustrations, for both its first and last segments. The story was republished in hardcover in 2006. == Plot == Dawn takes place on a nameless planet in a multiple-star system with six or seven stars, which are regarded as gods by the planet\\'s inhabitants. The planet orbits around Alpher, a yellow star similar to Earth\\'s sun, which forms a binary system with the smaller, cooler Bethe. The other four stars, Gamow, Dalton, Ephron, and Zwicky, are much farther away from Alpher and positioned in such a way that there is always at least one sun visible in the sky. The seventh \"god\" is the Pale One, which is either a large moon or a double planet. The orbits of the moon and stars are inclined enough that eclipses and occultations are rare events on the planet. Since there is always at least one sun in the sky, the planet never experiences darkness, except in enclosed spaces such as caves or windowless rooms. The movements of Alpher from east to west across the sky serve as the primary units of time, while longer periods are marked by seasonal shifts of Alpher\\'s position and the overtaking of one star by another. Hourglasses are used to measure shorter time intervals. Isak, the protagonist of the story, is a young scribe living in the city of Center, a feudal society that resembles the culture of medieval Europe. Despite his limited education as a scholar, he discovers that a pendulum can be used to accurately measure long periods of time, such as the time between sunrises. Through his travels and knowledge of this discovery, Isak develops the skills to measure the cycles of the suns and formulates a theory to explain them. Isak applies his theory to make accurate, long-term predictions of the movements of the \"gods.\" He discovers a remarkable event: Gamow will soon overtake the Pale One and pass directly behind it, blocking its light. The overtaking will last for more than half a cycle, resulting in a prolonged period of darkness for the entire world. Isak attempts to inform the priests of the Temple of Center of his prediction so that the people can prepare and avoid panic. However, both the people and the priests doubt Isak\\'s claims about the gods. The high priests fear that if the people were to believe Isak\\'s prediction, it would signal that the gods are angry with the priesthood and lead to societal unrest. As a result, they want to kill Isak before he can spread this foretelling. Isak seeks refuge in a merchant\\'s home and grows close to the merchant\\'s pregnant daughter who was attacked by the priests who disguised their actions as a religious rite. Isak learns about the corruption of the ruling theocracy and sees an opportunity to overthrow them when his foretelling comes to fruition. Members of a secret rebellion adopt Isak as their spokesperson, and as time passes, he gains more supporters. When the priests\\' guards come to take him captive, Isak\\'s followers abandon him. He is then subjected to torture and ordered to renounce his beliefs, but he refuses and is taken to the top of a tower to be further tortured in front of the people, serving as a warning to those who dare to oppose the temple priests. == Development history == McLaughlin pays homage to Asimov by naming the protagonist \"Isak\" and naming a historical figure Duke \"Lagash\", the name of the planet in \"Nightfall\". While Asimov simply used the Greek letters Alpha, Beta, Gamma, etc. to name the stars in his story, McLaughlin named his stars Alpher, Bethe, Gamow, Dalton, Ephron, and Zwicky. The first three are an allusion to the famous Alpha-Beta-Gamma paper written in 1948 by Ralph Alpher and George Gamow with Hans Bethe. Dalton and Zwicky are also famous scientists. == See also == Solar eclipses in fiction == References == Dawn title listing at the Internet Speculative Fiction Database',\n",

              " 'Charles Mallory Hatfield (July 15, 1875 – January 12, 1958) was an American \"rainmaker\". == Early life == Hatfield was born in Fort Scott, Kansas on July 15, 1875. His family moved to Southern California in the 1880s. As an adult, he became a salesman for the New Home Sewing Machine Company. In 1904, he moved to Glendale, California. == Career == In his free time Hatfield studied pluviculture and began to develop his own methods for producing rain. By 1902 he had created a secret mixture of 23 chemicals in large galvanized evaporating tanks that, he claimed, attracted rain. Hatfield called himself a \"moisture accelerator\".In 1904, promoter Fred Binney began a public relations campaign for Hatfield. A number of Los Angeles ranchers saw his ads in newspapers and promised Hatfield $50 to produce rain. In February, Hatfield and his brother Paul built an evaporating tower at La Crescenta where Hatfield released his mixture into the air. Hatfield\\'s attempt was apparently successful, so the ranchers paid him $100. Contemporary weather bureau reports described the rain as a small part of a storm that was already coming but Hatfield\\'s supporters disregarded this.: 81 Hatfield began to receive more job offers. He promised Los Angeles 18 inches (46 cm) of rain, apparently succeeded, and collected a fee of $1000.: 82–84 For this effort, Hatfield had built his tower on the grounds of the Esperanza Sanitarium in Altadena, near Rubio Canyon. In 1906 Hatfield was invited to the Yukon Territory, where he agreed to create rain for the water-dependent mines of the Klondike goldfields. The Klondike contract was for $10,000, but after unsuccessful efforts, Hatfield slipped away, collecting only $1,100 for expenses. This failure did not deter his supporters. In 1915 the San Diego city council, pressured by the San Diego Wide Awake Improvement Club, approached Hatfield to produce rain to fill the Morena Dam reservoir. Hatfield offered to produce rain for free, then charge $1,000 per inch ($393.7 per centimetre) for between forty and fifty inches (1.02 to 1.27 m) and free again over fifty inches (1.27 m). The council voted four to one for a $10,000 fee, payable when the reservoir was filled. A formal agreement was never drawn up, though Hatfield continued based on verbal understanding. Hatfield, with his brother, built a tower beside Lake Morena and was ready early in the New Year.: 91 On January 5, 1916 heavy rain began—and grew gradually heavier day by day. Dry riverbeds filled to the point of flooding. Worsening floods destroyed bridges, marooned trains and cut phone cables - not to mention flooding homes and farms. Two dams, Sweetwater Dam and one at Lower Otay Lake, overflowed. Rain stopped on 20 January but resumed two days later. On January 27 Lower Otay Dam broke, increasing the devastation and reportedly causing about 20 deaths (accounts vary on the exact number).Hatfield talked to the press on February 4 and said that the damage was not his fault and that the city should have taken adequate precautions. Hatfield had fulfilled the requirements of his contract—filling the reservoir—but the city council refused to pay the money unless Hatfield would accept liability for damages; there were already claims worth $3.5 million. Besides, there was no written contract. Hatfield tried to settle for $4000 and then sued the council. The suit continued until 1938 when two courts decided that the rain was an act of God, which absolved him of any wrongdoing, but also meant Hatfield did not get his fee.Hatfield\\'s fame only grew and he received more contracts for rainmaking. Among other things, in 1929 he tried to stop a forest fire in Honduras. Later the Bear Valley Mutual Water Company wanted to fill Big Bear Lake. However, during the Great Depression he had to return to his work as a sewing machine salesman. His wife divorced him. Charles Hatfield died January 12, 1958 and took his chemical formula with him to his grave in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. Hatfield claimed at least 500 successes. According to later commentators, Hatfield\\'s successes were mainly due to his meteorological skill and sense of timing, selecting periods where there was a high probability of rain anyway. == References in popular culture == Charles Hatfield and the 1916 flooding at Lake Morena is the subject of the song \"Hatfield\" by the band Widespread Panic. Singer/guitarist John Bell wrote the song after reading the story of the rainmaker in a Farmers\\' Almanac. The song was released on the album Everyday in 1993. Hatfield\\'s story inspired the 1956 Burt Lancaster film The Rainmaker, based on the play of the same name. Hollywood invited Hatfield to the premiere. The play also became the basis of a Broadway Musical, 110 in the Shade. Charles Hatfield\\'s fictional great-great-granddaughter has taken up his research in T. Jefferson Parker\\'s 2007 novel Storm Runners.Charles Hatfield and the San Diego flood was featured in a 2016 episode of the White Rabbit Project on Netflix.

              " 'Princess Harbour is a community in the Canadian province of Manitoba. The village is on a small peninsula on the east shore of Lake Winnipeg. The community was originally named Rabbit Point and is still referred to as such by locals. Recognized as a community by the Province of Manitoba in 1972 under the Northern Affairs Act, the settlement does not have a political leader but rather it is represented by someone who is called a \"contact person\".The Hudson Bay Company had a house at Rabbit Point through the mid to late 1800s. It was used as a place to stay while traveling through, but there are no records it was used for trading. The first mention of settler presence in the area began in 1890, and funeral and baptism records note the names of local families from then until present day. A store was built in the small settlement in 1934 and as the little community grew a school followed in 1939. The school changed its name from Princess Harbour School to the Dolly Magnusson School in 1982, the small school would eventually close in 1982. A coal oil fueled harbour light was maintained by the community as regulated by the government at the time. == Etymology == Though it is not known why the community was named Princess Harbour, local history books believe that the name is attributed to the SS Princess that sailed Lake Winnipeg at the turn of the 20th century. The name was not officially changed to Princess Harbour until 1952, when the community got its own post office. It\\'s noted the change of name came as a result of confusion with another location named Rabbit Point or Rabbit Lake somewhere in Manitoba. == Demographics == In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Princess Harbour had a population of 0 living in 0 of its 0 total private dwellings, a change of -100% from its 2016 population of 5. With a land area of 1.9 km2 (0.73 sq mi), it had a population density of 0.0/km2 (0.0/sq mi) in 2021. == References ==',\n",
              " 'Maddalena Cerasuolo, also known as Lenuccia (Naples, 2 February 1920 – Naples, 23 October 1999), was an Italian patriot and antifascist partisan.She is remembered especially for having actively participated with a significant role in the revolt against the Nazi army that occurred in Naples from 27 to 30 September 1943, which is remembered as the Four days of Naples. == Biography == The life of Maddalena, as well as that of many of her peers, was split in two parts by World War II. Nevertheless, the war allowed her to stand out in the ranks of the Resistenza and as a secret agent, working with the United Kingdom. After the war, she continued to live in Naples, until her death in 1999, after having married with surname Morgese and having two children, Gaetana and Gennaro. === Early years === Maddalena\\'s parents belonged to the working class; she was the daughter of Annunziata Capuozzo and Carlo Cerasuolo, who lived in the Stella neighborhood in Naples together with her other five sisters Titina, Maria, Anna, Dora, Rosaria and two brothers Giovanni and Vincenzo.The father, Carlo, who was working as cook, in the 1910s participated in the Italo-Turkish War and also later in the Resistenza when he was registered and imprisoned several times for acts of resistance against Fascism. During World War II, he was initially employed by the company Ansaldo to manage the canteen. Later he was unemployed, thereby he put up an itinerant stall where he prepared and sold fried pizzas.The mother, Annunziata, was employed as help-cook at Ansaldo too, following her husband. Later she helped him in his new activity.When the war was breaking out, Maddalena was about 20 years old, working as craftswoman at a small shoe factory. === Entering the Resistenza === During the war, Maddalena stood out when she participated in the gunfights that happened in the Materdei neighborhood, to avoid the German troops plundering the shoe factory near to vico delle Trone, in exchange for the weapons delivery. She volunteered to go alone on the prowl to calculate the size of the German troops and later to speak with Nazi officials, with the risk of not having enshrined Geneva Convention rights as ambassador. Maddalena Cerasuolo participated in the battle against the German troops by defending the Ponte della Sanità with the partisans of the neighborhoods Materdei and Stella, led by her father Carlo Cerasuolo, lieutenant Dino Del Prete and firefighter officer Vinicio Giacomelli. They contributed to keeping open an important entranceway to the city, and also an important branch of the aqueduct that supplied the center of Naples.For this episode she received a Medal of Military Valor and she was invited to the Royal Palace by General Montgomery, who hugged and kissed her. === Collaboration with UK secret services === Maddalena Cerasuolo, with her alias \"Maria Esposito\", agent number \"C22\", from 23 October 1943 to 8 February 1944, operated with the Special Operations Executive (SOE), which is the British secret service. After a short training at Castello Mezzatorre in Forio di Ischia, she participated in the missions named \"Hillside II\" and \"Kelvin\". The Hillside II mission consisted of passing beyond enemy lines, but it ended with three failed attempts.Kelvin was a maritime mission. Cerasuolo used a motor torpedo boat directed to Corsica, to get to the coast of Liguria from Bastia, to sabotage military sites by using weapons and explosives, as planned by the British strategy. Also this mission ended with a failure, five attempts without any landing. Moreover, Maddalena lost all her clothes that she had with herself, and was later reimbursed by the SOE.Still working with the SOE, Maddalena parachuted beyond the enemy lines when in Italy they were marked from Rome to Montecassino, to collect information by pretending to be the maid of the artist Anna d\\'Andria, who was collaborating by giving high society parties to understand the strategy of the German army.In the personal file of the SOE Maddalena is recorded as housewife, not married, living in vico della Neve, 23, Materdei, Naples at Carlo Cerasuolo\\'s house, active as special agent from 21 October 1943 to 8 February 1944 – even though she was still available to continue – with the following service notes: Subject took a conspicuous part in Naples insurrection. She help[ed] build barricades and took part in the fighting with rifle and hand grenades. She was discharged on 8 Feb. 1944 and paid up to date 7,500 lire for clothing lost. She received no bonus or certificate of service. == Recognition == Cerasuolo received several recognitions, both during her life, such as the Medal of Military Valor and other prestigious acknowledgements, and after her death, among those a toponymical dedication in the city of Naples. === Military recognitions === On 24 May 1946 she was honored with the Bronze Medal of Military Valor with the following citation: After speaking as speaker with the Germans in Vico delle Trone, she stood out in the following battle. In the same day, she participated [in] the fight in defense of the bridge Ponte della Sanità, next to her father and the partisans of Materdei e Stella neighborhoods.The collaboration with the SOE was recognized, besides with economic reimbursement, also with the following acknowledgement:For her proud behavior and for the contribution to the cause of liberty, in the name of this Command, I tribute her a praise and I thank her. === Civilian recognitions === Once the war ended, she received a certificate of merit signed by officer H.S. Carruthers, by the British kingdom.The year after her death, on 3 March 2000, the mayor Rosa Russo Iervolino inaugurated a commemorative plaque for Maddalena Cerasuolo, placed by Comune di Napoli and Istituto Campano per la Storia della Resistenza. === Popular culture === Maddalena Cerasuolo\\'s memory is held in the culture of the city of Naples, since she is quoted in several texts about the Resistenza and the Four days of Naples. Sometimes her story is brought up also in support of the thesis that Neapolitan resistance was not led by spontaneous riots, as is largely believed, but as the result of activity organized locally, within an internationally agreed strategy. ==== Books ==== In 2014, her daughter Gaetana Morgese published a book dedicated to her biography.She is quoted in several Italian books, such as the romance Il paradiso dei diavoli by Franco di Mare, 2013, in Le donne erediteranno la terra and in Possa il mio sangue servire by Aldo Cazzullo, 2016 and finally in Il treno dei bambini by Viola Ardone. ==== Music ==== In 1995, Carlo Faiello wrote lyrics and music of a song dedicated to Maddalena Cerasuolo, entitled \"Maddalena\", which was interpreted by several artists such as: Nuova Compagnia di Canto Popolare (1995) Lina Sastri (2000) Anna Maria Castelli (2010) Neapolis in fabula (2011) Paola Subrizi Quartet (2018) == See also == Four days of Naples Italian resistance movement Special Operations Executive (SOE) History of women in the Italian Resistance == References == == Bibliography == Gaetana Morgese (2010).

Smirnov was born in a family of clerical employees. His mother was imprisoned in 1937 for anti-Soviet activity and, as later revealed, was executed by gun shot. While studying at school, Yuri M. Smirnov was interested in mathematics and astronomy and after completing undergraduate study in 1939 entered the astronomy department of the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics of Moscow State University. However, soon under the influence of A. N. Kolmogorov, he transferred to the mathematical department of the same Faculty.After his second year of undergraduate study, Smirnov went in autumn 1941 to the front and served as a radio operator in the Northern Fleet until the end of WW II. After demobilization in 1945, he continued his studies at the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics of Moscow State University and began to participate in the seminars of the famous topologist P. S. Alexandrov. In 1948 Smirnov graduated from the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics and entered the graduate school of the same faculty, at the same time starting to work as a junior researcher at the Steklov Institute of Mathematics. In 1951 he defended his Ph.D. (Russian Candidate of Sciences) thesis О топологических пространствах, компактных в данном отрезке мощностей (On topological spaces, compact in a given interval of cardinalities), which was supervised by P. S. Alexandrov. In 1957 Smirnov received his Russian Doctor of Sciences degree with thesis Исследование по общей и равномерной топологии методом покрытий (Investigation of general and uniform topology by the covering method).From 1945 until the end of his life he worked at the Department of Higher Geometry and Topology of the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics of Moscow State University, from 1953 as an associate professor, and from 1958 as a full professor. He taught courses on analytical geometry, linear algebra and topology, linear algebra and geometry, differential geometry and topology, and the theories of retracts, shapes, and equivariant compactifications.Smirnov published over a hundred scientific papers, most of which are related to general topology. He is the author of fundamental results on the problem of metrization of topological spaces and in equivariant topology, as well as in dimension theory and in the theories of shapes, retracts, and proximity spaces. His name is associated with the famous Nagata-Smirnov metrization theorem (proved independently by the Japanese mathematician Jun-iti Nagata). The theorem gives necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a metric generating the original topology. Smirnov gave lectures not only in Russia, but also in Germany, Poland, Bulgaria, Georgia, Armenia, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan. He supervised 12 Russian Doctor of Sciences (habilitation) degrees and more than 35 Candidate of Sciences degrees (PhDs). He was awarded the Order of the Patriotic War for his WW II service. In 1962 he was an Invited Speaker with talk Некоторые вопросы равномерной топологии (Some questions of uniform topology) at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Stockholm. He was awarded honorary titles: Honored Professor of Moscow State University (1996), Honored Scientist of the USSR (1981), and Honored Scientist of the Russian Federation (2002). In 1995 he received the Wacław Sierpiński Medal jointly from the Polish Academy of Sciences and the University of Warsaw. == References == == External links == Летопись Московского университета (Annals of Moscow University) Страница Ю.

              " 'In usage in the Southern United States, a bayou () is a body of water typically found in a flat, low-lying area. It may refer to an extremely slow-moving stream, river (often with a poorly defined shoreline), marshy lake, wetland, or creek. They typically contain brackish water highly conducive to fish life and plankton. Bayous are commonly found in the Gulf Coast region of the southern United States, especially in the Mississippi River Delta, though they also exist elsewhere. A bayou is often an anabranch or minor braid of a braided channel that is slower than the mainstem, often becoming boggy and stagnant. Though fauna varies by region, many bayous are home to crawfish, certain species of shrimp, other shellfish, catfish, frogs, toads, salamanders, newts, American alligators, American crocodiles, herons, lizards, turtles, tortoises, spoonbills, snakes, and leeches, as well as many other species. == Etymology == The word entered American English via Louisiana French in Louisiana and is thought to originate from the Choctaw word bayuk, which means \"small stream\". After first appearing in the 17th century, the term is found in 18th century accounts and maps, often as bayouc or bayouque, where it was eventually shortened to its current form. The first settlements of the Bayou Têche and other bayous were founded by the Louisiana Creoles, and the bayous are commonly associated with Creole and Cajun culture. An alternative spelling, \"buyou\", is also known to have been in use, as in \"Pine Buyou\", used in a description by Congress in 1833 of Arkansas Territory. == Geography == The term Bayou Country is most closely associated with Cajun and Creole cultural groups derived from French settlers and stretching along the Gulf Coast from Houston, Texas, to Mobile, Alabama, and picking back up in South Florida around the Everglades, with its center in New Orleans, Louisiana. The term may also be associated with the homelands of certain Choctaw tribal groups.Houston has the nickname \"Bayou City\". As of 2016 \"bye-you\" US: is the most common pronunciation, while a few use \"bye-oh\" US: , although that pronunciation is declining. == Environmental Risks == Bayous are susceptible to pollution such as runoff from nearby urban communities (which can result in eutrophication) and oil spills. Many bayous have been cleared away by human activity as well (with those in Louisiana having shrunk by 4,900 square kilometers since the 1930s). == Notable examples == Bayou Bartholomew Bayou Corne Bayou La Batre Bayou Lafourche Bayou St. John Bayou Teche Big Bayou Canot Buffalo Bayou Cypress Bayou == See also == Backswamp – Environment on a floodplain where deposits settle after a flood Billabong – Australian term for a seasonal oxbow lake Hurricane on the Bayou – 2006 documentary film by Greg MacGillivray Oxbow lake – U-shaped lake or pool Yazoo stream – Hydrologic term Bayeux – Subprefecture and commune in Normandy, France == References == == External links ==',\n",

              " 'The Bobby Moore statue is a bronze sculpture of the former West Ham and England footballer Bobby Moore, situated directly outside England\\'s national stadium, Wembley Stadium, in Wembley Park, north-west London. It commemorates the life of Moore, who captained the only England side ever to win the World Cup, defeating Germany 4–2 in the 1966 FIFA World Cup Final held in England at the old Wembley Stadium, demolished in 2003. Commissioned by the Football Association, it was unveiled outside the new stadium when it opened in 2007, fourteen years after Moore\\'s death from cancer, aged 51. Standing 20 feet (6.1 m) tall on a stone plinth, it looks out over spectators as they walk down Wembley Way into the stadium. Sculpted by the Royal Sculptor Philip Jackson, it is Jackson\\'s second piece featuring Moore, after the World Cup Sculpture unveiled in 2003. == Statue == The work, titled The Bobby Moore Sculpture by Jackson, is a twice life size, tall bronze piece and stands at 20 feet (6.1 m) including the plinth. It is located at the end of Wembley Way and weighs around two tons. It was placed in a highly prominent position, on a plinth on the north side of the stadium, with Moore looking north along Wembley Way, which forms the main pedestrian approach to the stadium, where it can look over arriving fans.In addition to the statue, the work features on the front of its stone plinth a plaque which depicts the rest of the 1966 England team, while similarly on the side is mounted a sculpture of an England cap, with \"World Championship, Jules Rimet Cup, 1970\" written on the peak. The work also features an inscription composed by Jeff Powell, a football journalist and one of Moore\\'s closest friends. It reads: Immaculate footballer. Imperial defender. Immortal hero of 1966. First Englishman to raise the World Cup aloft. Favourite son of London\\'s East End. Finest legend of West Ham United. National Treasure. Master of Wembley. Lord of the game. Captain extraordinary. Gentleman of all time. == Inspiration == The subject of the statue is the English footballer Bobby Moore OBE (1941–1993). Moore, who died of cancer aged 51, was the captain of West Ham United and England team, and had led England to victory at the 1966 World Cup at old Wembley. The statue is a tribute to Moore\\'s unique achievement of being a World Cup winning England captain, and was commissioned in response to a Football Association fan poll to find the greatest England player of the last 50 years, won \"hands down\" by Moore.Jackson sought to create a sculpture that \"captures the qualities associated with Bobby Moore, namely integrity, loyalty, leadership, popularity and humility but above all as the greatest-ever English footballer.\" Jackson consulted with a specially formed panel to agree the design, formed from Moore\\'s widow Stephanie, Moore\\'s fellow footballers and friends Sir Bobby Charlton, Sir Geoff Hurst and Sir Trevor Brooking, the FA and WNSL chiefs Brian Barwick and Michael Cunnah, the Royal British Society of Sculptors President Brian Falconbridge, and architect Lord Foster, as well as fan representative Gavin Morton-Holmes. On unveiling, Jackson said \"What emerged [from the design consultation] was he was this extraordinary presence in the team, which gave this enormous confidence and allowed the team to sort of win through in \\'66 and so I created the sculpture in this sort of old fashioned heroic style.\" == History == === Commissioning === Wembley National Stadium Ltd (WNSL) announced it was commissioning the statue in September 2005, while the new Wembley was being built, replacing the Old Wembley. According to Paul Kelso of The Guardian, the statue was the Football Association\\'s first official tribute to Moore.Jackson was selected from a short-list to produce the statue. It was the second time Jackson had produced a sculpture of Moore, having completed The Champions sculpture situated near West Ham\\'s stadium, the Boleyn Ground, unveiled in 2003 by Prince Andrew, Duke of York, and features Moore held aloft on the shoulders of other players, himself holding the World Cup trophy aloft. === Production === Preview images of the clay mould for the sculpture were released in January 2006, while Stephanie Moore visited the studio to see the work in progress. Modelled in clay, the sculpture was then moulded in hard plaster and then sand, to facilitate casting in bronze, with the cast statue finished by patination for the final colour.Jackson created eight casts of Moore\\'s right foot for the sculpture, one of which was auctioned on 31 May 2006 at Christie\\'s in aid of Moore\\'s cancer charity. === Unveiling === The statue was unveiled on 11 May 2007 by Sir Bobby Charlton, with guests including Moore\\'s widow Stephanie, Prime Minister Tony Blair and Sir Geoff Hurst. The statue was the \"finishing touch\" to the completion of the new Wembley, which officially opened after several delays, on 19 May, with the staging of the 2007 FA Cup Final. WNSL originally intended to unveil it in 2006, on the 40th anniversary of the World Cup win, with the new stadium having originally been due to open in time for the May 2006 FA Cup Final. == Reception == The statue, along with the signature steel arch, are described by Paul Hayward of The Guardian as the \"inspiring architectural flourishes\" of the stadium. Henry Winter of The Daily Telegraph, writing in 2009, described how the statue \"captures Moore\\'s dignity\", and is the place where everyone on their way into Wembley pauses for a moment to admire \"this magnificent likeness of the most important figure in the history of English sport and [give] thanks for 1966\".Moore\\'s widow said of the completed statue, \"Philip has done an incredible job of capturing Bobby – both in terms of his qualities as a player and his physical appearance.\" == Gallery == == See also == List of public art in Brent == References ==',\n",
              " '\"Night Time Is the Right Time\" or \"The Right Time\" is a rhythm and blues song recorded by American musician Nappy Brown in 1957. It draws on earlier blues songs and has inspired popular versions, including those by Ray Charles, Rufus and Carla, and James Brown, which reached the record charts. == Earlier songs == Blues pianist Roosevelt Sykes (listed as \"the Honey Dripper\") recorded \"Night Time Is the Right Time\" in 1937. Called \"one of his \\'hits\\' of the day\", it is a moderate-tempo twelve-bar blues that features Sykes on vocal and piano. It has been suggested that it was \"drawn from the old vaudeville tradition\": In 1938, Big Bill Broonzy recorded the song, as \"Night Time Is the Right Time No. 2,\" with slightly different (and more suggestive) lyrics. The same year, Roosevelt Sykes recorded a new version, similarly entitled \"Night Time Is the Right Time #2,\" also with slightly different lyrics. These earliest recordings of \"Night Time Is the Right Time\" are credited to Roosevelt Sykes and Leroy Carr. Carr died in 1935 without any known recordings of the song; \"Night Time Is The Right Time\" bears similarity to Carr\\'s \"When The Sun Goes Down\". == Nappy Brown song == In 1957, Nappy Brown recorded the song as \"The Right Time\". Called \"a highlight of Brown\\'s early career\", his version features additional lyrics with background singers answering his vocal lines. The instrumental accompaniment is provided by Buster Cooper on trombone, Hilton Jefferson on alto sax, Budd Johnson on tenor sax, Kelly Owens on piano, Skeeter Best on guitar, Leonard Gaskin on bass, and Bobby Donaldson on drums. Brown\\'s song opens with Brown\\'s version did not reach the national record charts, but was \"borrowed by Ray Charles in short order\". During his career, Brown recorded several versions of the song (sometimes varying the title). His original single lists the songwriter as \"N. Brown\". == Ray Charles version == Ray Charles recorded his version, titled \"(Night Time Is) The Right Time\", on October 28, 1958, at the Atlantic Records studio in New York City. According to Brown, \"The difference between me and Ray Charles\\'s ‘Night Time Is the Right Time\\' ... is he had it up-tempo with Mary Ann and them behind him—the ladies. I had mine in a slow tempo with a gospel group behind me. That was my gospel group. But he got everything just like mine, note for note\". Margie Hendrix with Charles\\' backup singers the Raelettes provided the accompaniment to Charles\\' vocals. Released as a single, it reached number five on the Billboard R&B chart and number 95 on its Hot 100 chart in 1959. The songwriters were listed as \"Brown-Cadena-Herman\" on the single and the albums Ray Charles in Person (1960) and The Genius Sings the Blues (1961); however, some later anthologies only list Lew Herman, also known as Herman Lubinsky, who was the owner of Nappy Brown\\'s record label. The song is also included on Ray Charles at Newport (1958) and the film soundtrack of Ray (2004). In the second season episode of The Cosby Show \"Happy Anniversary\", the Huxtable family lip-syncs to Ray Charles\\' version. CNN\\'s Lisa Respers France stated \"No \\'Cosby Show\\' list is complete without this family performance... Keshia Knight Pulliam stole our hearts as little Rudy Huxtable in this scene.\" while Vulture called it The Cosby Show\\'s best musical moment. In 1997, TV Guide ranked this episode number 54 on its \\'100 Greatest Episodes of All Time\\' list. == James Brown version == James Brown recorded the song for the small Churchill/Augusta record label. It was released in 1983 as the B-side of his single \"Bring It On...Bring It On\". Brown\\'s version (subtitled \"To be With the One That You Love\") went on to reach number 73 in the Billboard R&B chart. Robert Christgau reviewed Brown\\'s version favorably, singling out for praise the contribution of its unidentified female guest vocalist, \"a Brownette who approaches any kind of note as if she owns it.\" == References ==',\n",

              " 'Histamine H3 receptors are expressed in the central nervous system and to a lesser extent the peripheral nervous system, where they act as autoreceptors in presynaptic histaminergic neurons and control histamine turnover by feedback inhibition of histamine synthesis and release. The H3 receptor has also been shown to presynaptically inhibit the release of a number of other neurotransmitters (i.e. it acts as an inhibitory heteroreceptor) including, but probably not limited to dopamine, GABA, acetylcholine, noradrenaline, histamine and serotonin. The gene sequence for H3 receptors expresses only about 22% and 20% homology with both H1 and H2 receptors respectively. There is much interest in the histamine H3 receptor as a potential therapeutic target because of its involvement in the neuronal mechanism behind many cognitive disorders and especially its location in the central nervous system. == Tissue distribution == Central nervous system Peripheral nervous system Heart Lungs Gastrointestinal tract Endothelial cells == Function == Like all histamine receptors, the H3 receptor is a G-protein coupled receptor. The H3 receptor is coupled to the Gi G-protein, so it leads to inhibition of the formation of cAMP. Also, the β and γ subunits interact with N-type voltage gated calcium channels, to reduce action potential mediated influx of calcium and hence reduce neurotransmitter release. H3 receptors function as presynaptic autoreceptors on histamine-containing neurons.The diverse expression of H3 receptors throughout the cortex and subcortex indicates its ability to modulate the release of a large number of neurotransmitters. H3 receptors are thought to play a part in the control of satiety. == Isoforms == There are at least six H3 receptor isoforms in the human, and more than 20 discovered so far. In rats there have been six H3receptor subtypes identified so far. Mice also have three reported isoforms. These subtypes all have subtle difference in their pharmacology (and presumably distribution, based on studies in rats) but the exact physiological role of these isoforms is still unclear. == Pharmacology == === Agonists === There are currently no therapeutic products acting as selective agonists for H3 receptors, although there are several compounds used as research tools which are reasonably selective agonists. Some examples are: (R)-α-methylhistamine Cipralisant (initially assessed as H3 antagonist, later found to be an agonist, shows functional selectivity, activating some G-protein coupled pathways but not others) Imbutamine (also H4 agonist) Immepip Imetit Immethridine Methimepip Proxyfan (complex functional selectivity; partial agonist effects on cAMP inhibition and MAPK activity, antagonist on histamine release, and inverse agonist on arachidonic acid release) === Antagonists === These include: A-304121 (No tolerance formation, silent antagonist) A-349,821 ABT-239 Betahistine (also weak H1 agonist) Burimamide (also weak H2 antagonist) Ciproxifan Clobenpropit (also H4 antagonist) Conessine Failproxifan (No tolerance formation) Impentamine Iodophenpropit Irdabisant Pitolisant Thioperamide (also H4 antagonist) VUF-5681 (4-[3-(1H-Imidazol-4-yl)propyl]piperidine) == Therapeutic potential == The H3-receptor is a promising potential therapeutical target for many (cognitive) disorders that are caused by a histaminergic H3R dysfunction, because it is linked to the central nervous system and its regulation of other neurotransmitters. Examples of such disorders are: sleep disorders (including narcolepsy), Tourette syndrome, Parkinson, OCD, ADHD, ASS and drug addictions.This receptor has been proposed as a target for treating sleep disorders. The receptor has also been proposed as a target for treating neuropathic pain.Because of its ability to modulate other neurotransmitters, H3 receptor ligands are being investigated for the treatment of numerous neurological conditions, including obesity (because of the histamine/orexinergic system interaction), movement disorders (because of H3 receptor-modulation of dopamine and GABA in the basal ganglia), schizophrenia and ADHD (again because of dopamine modulation) and research is underway to determine whether H3 receptor ligands could be useful in modulating wakefulness (because of effects on noradrenaline, glutamate and histamine).There is also evidence that the H3-receptor plays an important role in Tourette syndrome. Mouse-models and other research demonstrated that reducing histamine concentration in the H3R causes tics, but adding histamine in the striatum decreases the symptoms. The interaction between histamine (H3-receptor) and dopamine as well as other neurotransmitters is an important underlying mechanism behind the disorder. == History == 1983 The H3 receptor is pharmacologically identified. 1988 H3 receptor found to mediate inhibition of serotonin release in rat brain cortex. 1997 H3 receptors shown to modulate ischemic norepinephrine release in animals. 1999 H3 receptor cloned 2000 H3 receptors called \"new frontier in myocardial ischemia\" 2002 H3(-/-) mice (mice that do not have this receptor) == See also == Antihistamine – histamine receptor antagonists H3-receptor antagonist Histamine H1-receptor Histamine H2-receptor Histamine H4-receptor == References == == Further reading == == External links == \"Histamine Receptors: H3\".

              " 'The 110th Boat Race took place on 28 March 1964. Held annually, the event is a side-by-side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames. The Oxford crew was the heaviest in Boat Race history. The race was won by Cambridge by six-and-half lengths. Cambridge won the Women\\'s Boat Race. == Background == The Boat Race is a side-by-side rowing competition between the University of Oxford (sometimes referred to as the \"Dark Blues\") and the University of Cambridge (sometimes referred to as the \"Light Blues\"). The race was first held in 1829, and since 1845 has taken place on the 4.2-mile (6.8 km) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London. The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities, followed throughout the United Kingdom and broadcast worldwide. Oxford went into the race as reigning champions, having won the previous year\\'s race by five lengths, while Cambridge led overall in the event with 60 victories to Oxford\\'s 48 (excluding the \"dead heat\" of 1877).The first Women\\'s Boat Race took place in 1927, but did not become an annual fixture until the 1960s. Up until 2014, the contest was conducted as part of the Henley Boat Races, but as of the 2015 race, it is held on the River Thames, on the same day as the men\\'s main and reserve races. This year\\'s women\\'s race was the first to be held since 1952. Writing in the Financial Times, Joseph Mallalieu noted that the Boat Race was subsidised by The Varsity Match every year. Despite Oxford being \"firm favourites\" upon their arrival at the Tideway, Cambridge put in better performances in training, and by the time of the race were considered the favourites themselves. The main race was umpired for the eighth and final time by the former Olympian Kenneth Payne who had rowed for Cambridge in the 1932 and 1934 races. == Crews == Although it was the heaviest Cambridge crew ever, they weighed an average of 13 st 4.75 lb (84.5 kg), almost 3 pounds (1.4 kg) per rower less than Oxford, who were the heaviest crew in Boat Race history. Oxford saw two former Blues return in Miles Morland and Duncan Spencer, while Cambridge\\'s crew included four Boat Race veterans in Donald Legget, Mike Bevan, John Lecky and Christopher Davey. Lecky was a Canadian international rower who had won a silver medal in the men\\'s eight at the 1960 Summer Olympics. Six of Oxford\\'s crew came from Keble College, five of those schooled at Eton College. == Race == Cambridge won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station, handing the Middlesex side of the river to Oxford. With a \"calm, following wind\", the race commenced at 2.20 p.m., and within a minute, Cambridge had a quarter-length lead before Oxford closed the gap at Craven Cottage. The Light Blues reached the Mile Post three seconds ahead and crossed over to the midstream. By Harrods Furniture Depository they had extended their lead out to two lengths and passed below Hammersmith Bridge a further half-length ahead. Despite a surge from Oxford, Cambridge were sixteen seconds ahead at Chiswick Steps and increased the gap to twenty seconds by Barnes Bridge. Cambridge won by 6+1⁄2 lengths in a time of 19 minutes 18 seconds, 23 seconds ahead of Oxford.The victory was Cambridge\\'s 61st in the contest, taking the overall score to 61–48. The Cambridge boat club president and stroke Christopher Davey said: \"Everything went as planned, but Oxford hung on more than I would have liked at the end. I would have liked to have taken it to 10 lengths if possible but Oxford kept going splendidly at the end.\"In the 20th running of the Women\\'s Boat Race, Cambridge triumphed, their third consecutive victory. == References == Notes Bibliography Burnell, Richard (1979).

              " 'John Walter Lord Jr. (October 8, 1917 – May 19, 2002) was an American author, lawyer, copywriter and popular historian best known for his 1955 account of the sinking of the RMS Titanic, A Night to Remember. == Biography == === Early life === Lord was born in Baltimore, Maryland to John Walter Lord Sr. and Henrietta MacTier (Hoffman) Lord on October 8, 1917. His father, who was a lawyer, died when Lord was just three years old. Lord\\'s grandfather, Richard Curzon Hoffman, was president of the Baltimore Steam Packet Company (\"Old Bay Line\") steamship firm in the 1890s.In July 1925, at the age of 7, Lord traveled across the Atlantic Ocean with his mother and sister, from New York to Cherbourg and Southampton, on the RMS Olympic, the Titanic\\'s sister ship. Like many other boys who attended high school at Baltimore\\'s Gilman School, he spent his summers at Hyde Bay Camp for Boys at Hyde Bay in Cooperstown, New York, where he was awarded the honorary title of \"The Commodore\" and later returned to reign over many annual camp events, like the eight inch regatta and closing barbecue and bonfire. He then studied history at Princeton University and graduated in 1939. Lord then enrolled at Yale Law School, interrupting his studies to join the United States Army after the attack on Pearl Harbor. During World War II, he was assigned to the Office of Strategic Services as a code clerk in London, in 1942. He was the agency\\'s secretariat when the war ended in 1945. Afterwards, Lord returned to Yale, where he earned a degree in law. === Career === Lord wrote, or edited and annotated 11 bestselling books on such diverse subjects as the Attack on Pearl Harbor (Day of Infamy, 1957), the Battle of Midway (Incredible Victory, 1967), the Battle of the Alamo (A Time to Stand, 1961), the Battle of Baltimore (The Dawn\\'s Early Light, 1972), Arctic exploration (Peary to the Pole, 1963), pre-World War I America (The Good Years: From 1900 to the First World War, 1960), Coastwatchers (Lonely Vigil, 1977), the Dunkirk evacuation (The Miracle of Dunkirk, 1982), and the civil rights struggle (The Past That Would Not Die, 1965). Shortly after going to work as a copywriter for the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency in New York City, Lord published The Fremantle Diary, edited and annotated from the journals of the British officer and Confederate sympathizer, Arthur Fremantle, who toured the South for three months in 1863. It became a mild, but surprising, success in 1954, as Lord was well into completing A Night to Remember, which would win him much popular acclaim. A Night to Remember, about the sinking of the RMS Titanic, became a bestseller in 1955 and was made into a popular 1958 British movie of the same name. The historian tracked down 63 Titanic survivors and wrote a dramatic, minute-by-minute account of the ocean liner\\'s sinking during her maiden voyage. Lord\\'s knowledge of the Titanic catastrophe achieved considerable renown, and he frequently lectured at meetings of the Titanic Historical Society. In his final years, Lord wrote another book about the Titanic titled The Night Lives On: Thoughts, Theories and Revelations about the Titanic, published in 1986, a year after the wreck of the Titanic was discovered and interest in the Titanic renewed again. In the next decade, Lord served as a consultant to director James Cameron during the filming of Titanic (1997). The sequel documentary to Cameron\\'s film Titanic, Ghosts of the Abyss (2003), was dedicated to Lord\\'s memory.In 2009, Jenny Lawrence edited and published a biography of Lord — The Way It Was: Walter Lord on His Life and Books. In the late 1980s, Lawrence had recorded hours of interviews she had with Lord, in which he discussed his writing and life. After chapters on his early life in Baltimore and up to his time with the OSS in London and Paris, chapters are devoted to his research and writing of each of his books. === Death === Lord died at age 84 on May 19, 2002, after suffering from Parkinson\\'s disease, at his Manhattan home. Noted historian David McCullough said of Lord at his death, \"He was one of the most generous and kind-hearted men I\\'ve ever known, and when I had stars in my eyes and wanted to become a writer, he was a great help. I\\'ll always be indebted to him.\"Lord is buried in his maternal family\\'s plot at historic Green Mount Cemetery in Baltimore. His grave is marked by a marble bench listing the books he authored. == Publications == Lord published 12 historical works: The Fremantle Diary (1954) (ed.) A Night to Remember (1955) Day of Infamy: The Bombing of Pearl Harbor (1957) The Good Years: From 1900 to the First World War (1960) A Time to Stand: The Epic of the Alamo (1961) Peary to the Pole (1963) The Past That Would Not Die (1965) Incredible Victory: The Battle of Midway (1967) The Dawn\\'s Early Light: The War of 1812 and the Battle That Inspired Francis Scott Key to Write \"The Star-Spangled Banner (1972) Lonely Vigil: Coastwatchers of the Solomons (Bluejacket Books) (1977) The Miracle of Dunkirk: The True Story of Operation Dynamo (1982) The Night Lives On: Thoughts, Theories and Revelations about the Sinking of the \"Unsinkable\" Ship - Titanic (1986) == References == == Further reading == Krebs, Albin & Pyle, Richard (2002). \"A Tribute to Walter Lord\".

              " 'An act of entrustment is one of four essential requirements which must be in place under European Union law in order to ensure that the financial compensation paid to an organisation providing a public service is not treated as \"state aid\" as defined by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Article 106(2) of the Treaty (formerly Article 86(2) of the European Communities Treaty), states that: Undertakings entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest or having the character of a revenue-producing monopoly shall be subject to the rules contained in the Treaties, in particular to the rules on competition, in so far as the application of such rules does not obstruct the performance, in law or in fact, of the particular tasks assigned to them. The development of trade must not be affected to such an extent as would be contrary to the interests of the Union. In its judgment in the case of Altmark Trans GmbH and Regierungsprasidium Magdeburg v. Nahverkehrsgesellschaft Altmark GmbH (the Altmark case), the Court of Justice of the European Union held that public sector compensation does not constitute state aid if the following four criteria are all met: The organisation receiving funds (compensation) must actually have public service obligations to discharge, and the obligations must be clearly defined; The parameters on the basis of which the compensation is calculated must be established in advance in an objective and transparent manner; The compensation must not exceed what is necessary to cover all or part of the costs incurred in the discharge of the public sector obligations, taking into account the relevant receipts and a reasonable profit; Either,– The undertaking which is to discharge the public service obligations must have been chosen pursuant to a public procurement procedure which would allow for the selection of the bidder capable of providing the services at the least cost to the community; or – The level of compensation needed must be determined on the basis of an analysis of the costs which a typical undertaking, well run and adequately equipped, would have incurred.The European Commission has stated that an \"act of entrustment\" is necessary in order to set out the public service obligations of the undertaking and must have been committed to the organisation through an official act having legal force under the national law of the relevant EU member state. There need not be any specific legal framework covering acts of entrustment, but the act must extend sufficiently to create an obligation or accountability: permission, such as legal recognition or regulatory approval would not be sufficient. The obligation may be set out in legislation, the terms of a contract or in certain cases in a grant agreement. The act of entrustment should, in particular, state the nature, territorial scope and duration of the public service obligations, the organisation concerned, and the nature of any exclusive or special rights which the organisation may be able to exercise, along with the mechanism for calculating the level of compensation. == References ==',\n",

              " \"Odorrana tormota, also known as the concave-eared torrent frog, is a species of frog native to China. Its distribution is restricted to Huangshan Mountains in Anhui and Jiande and Anji counties in northern Zhejiang. It occurs in fast-flowing streams and the surrounding habitats, and breeds in streams. The informally assigned common name for frogs in this genus (and for frogs in certain other genera) is torrent frog. == Taxonomy == This species was formerly placed in the genus Amolops and later on separated in a monotypic genus Wurana. It was eventually recognized to belong in the genus Odorrana where it is perhaps closely related to O. versabilis and the long-snout torrent frog (O. nasica) which also was for long placed in Amolops. The informally assigned common name for frogs in this genus (and for frogs in certain other genera) is torrent frog == Ultrasonic communication == Concave-eared torrent frog is the first frog (and the first non-mammalian vertebrate) demonstrated to both produce and perceive ultrasonic frequencies. These frogs' preferred habitat is adjacent to rapidly moving water which produces perpetual low-frequency background noise. Thus, the use of high-frequency calls is believed to facilitate intraspecific communication within the frogs' noisy environment.Concave-eared torrent frogs have extremely thin eardrums recessed in their ears, which allows for the ear bones that connect the drum to sound processing part of the ear to be shorter and lighter. Most frogs have thick eardrums close to the surface of the skin and can only hear frequencies below 12 kilohertz.

In pursuit of that, he moved to saint Petersburg and began auditing classes at the Imperial Academy of Arts. One of his portraits was awarded a small silver medal in 1861.He was a regular participant in the Academy\\'s exhibitions and was named an \"Artist\" in 1864. Later he became a \"First-Class Artist\" (1869). He was named an \"Academician\" in 1874 for his portrait of War Minister, Dmitry Milyutin. By 1884, he was a \"Free Artist\" and honorary member of the Academy. He was one of the founding members of the Society of Russian Watercolorists. Among his best-known works are a series of portrait albums: thirty of Central Asian dignitaries who came to Moscow for the coronation of Alexander III (1884); forty-five of the Knights of various military orders (1886); and members of an embassy from \\'Abd al-Ahad Khan, the Emir of Bukhara (1889).He also provided illustrations for several periodicals and participated in exhibitions held by the Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts. == Works == == References == == External links == Media related to Stepan Alexandrovsky at Wikimedia Commons',\n",
              " 'William Dwight Pierce (November 16, 1881, Champaign, Illinois – April 29, 1967, Los Angeles) was an American entomologist.He was one of the earliest students to graduate from the Department of Entomology and Ornithology at the University of Nebraska. He worked as an entomologist at the Los Angeles County Museum (now the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County). He was particularly interested in insect pests, including the cotton boll weevil, and their control. Mainly between 1904 and 1931, he published numerous scientific papers and other works on the topic; perhaps the most significant being the book Sanitary Entomology (1921), of which a sixth edition was published in 2010. During the late 1930s, he taught entomology at Glendale Junior College in Los Angeles; where he influenced Charles Anthony Fleschner, who went on to have a distinguished career in entomology at University of California, Riverside. He described several taxa; but all except Premnotrypes, a genus of weevils in family Curculionidae, appear to have been subsequently reclassified as junior synonyms. Some materials relating to Pierce are held in the collection of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County.The weevil species Premnotrypes piercei and Rhigopsidius piercei have been named in his honor. == References ==',\n",
              " 'A smoke ring is a visible vortex ring formed by smoke in a clear atmosphere. Smokers may blow smoke rings from the mouth, intentionally or accidentally. Smoke rings may also be formed by sudden bursts of fire (such as lighting and immediately putting out a cigarette lighter), by shaking a smoke source (such as an incense stick) up and down, by firing certain types of artillery, or by the use of special devices, such as vortex ring guns and vortex ring toys. The head of a mushroom cloud is a large smoke ring. A smoke ring is commonly formed when a puff of smoke is suddenly injected into clear air, especially through a narrow opening. The outer parts of the puff are slowed by the still air (or by edges of the opening) relative to the central part, imparting it the characteristic poloidal flow pattern. The smoke makes the ring visible, but does not significantly affect the flow. The same phenomenon occurs with any fluid, producing vortex rings which are invisible but otherwise entirely similar to smoke rings. == Smoking and breathing == A smoker may produce rings by taking smoke into their mouth and expelling it with a tongue flick, by closing the jaw, tapping the cheek, or producing a sudden burst of air with the lungs and throat. The smoker may also use any of those methods to blow into a cloud of smoke outside their mouth. A trick often performed in conjunction with mouth-blown smoke rings is the French inhale. It is also possible to produce a vapour ring by using the same techniques on a cold day by exhaling.The most famous such steam rings were those produced during the mid-20th century by Douglas Leigh\\'s billboard on the Hotel Claridge in New York City\\'s Times Square, advertising Camel cigarettes. An automated steam chamber behind the billboard produced puffs of steam every four seconds, giving the appearance of smoke rings leaving the smoker\\'s open mouth and drifting away. Inspired by a World War II-era prohibition on lighted advertising, the Camel smoker remained a Times Square landmark long afterward.Some users of electronic cigarettes modify their devices to inhale large amounts of vapour at once, to exhale \"clouds\" in patterns like smoke rings. == Volcanoes == Under particular conditions, some volcanic vents can produce large visible smoke rings. Though a rare phenomenon, several volcanoes have been observed emitting massive vortex rings of steam and gas: Mount Etna, Italy (Sicily) Stromboli, Italy (Aeolian Islands) Eyjafjallajökull, Iceland Hekla, Iceland Tungurahua, Ecuador Pacaya, Guatemala Mount Redoubt, United States (Alaska) Mount Aso, Japan (Kyushu) Whakaari (White Island), New Zealand Gunung Slamet, Indonesia (Central Java) Momotombo, Nicaragua (León) == See also == Bubble ring Vortex ring toy == References == == External links == How to puff a smoke ring?

              " 'Cluedo (), known as Clue in North America, is a murder mystery game for three to six players (depending on editions) that was devised in 1943 by British board game designer Anthony E. Pratt. The game was first manufactured by Waddingtons in the United Kingdom in 1949. Since then, it has been relaunched and updated several times, and it is currently owned and published by the American game and toy company Hasbro. The object of the game is to determine who murdered the game\\'s victim, where the crime took place, and which weapon was used. Each player assumes the role of one of the six suspects and attempts to deduce the correct answer by strategically moving around a game board representing the rooms of a mansion and collecting clues about the circumstances of the murder from the other players. Numerous games, books, a film, television series, and a musical have been released as part of the Cluedo franchise. Several spinoffs have been released featuring various extra characters, weapons and rooms, or different game play. The original game is marketed as the \"Classic Detective Game\", and the various spinoffs are all distinguished by different slogans. In 2008, Cluedo: Discover the Secrets was created (with changes to board, gameplay and characters) as a modern spin-off, but was criticised in the media and by fans of the original game. Cluedo: The Classic Mystery Game was then introduced in 2012, returning to Pratt\\'s classic formula but also adding several variations. == History == Holed up in his home in Birmingham, England during air raids on the city during World War II, Anthony E. Pratt, an English musician and factory worker, recalled the murder mystery games played by some of his clients at private music gigs as well as the detective fiction popular at the time, most notably Agatha Christie. In 1944, Pratt applied for a patent of his invention of a murder/mystery-themed game, originally named Murder! Shortly thereafter, Pratt and his wife, Elva Pratt (1913–1990), who had helped design the game, presented it to Waddingtons\\' executive Norman Watson, who immediately purchased it and provided its trademark name of Cluedo (a play on \"clue\" and Ludo, ludo being Latin for \"I play\").Although the patent was granted in 1947, postwar shortages postponed the game\\'s official United Kingdom launch until 1949. It was simultaneously licensed to Parker Brothers in the United States for publication, where it was renamed Clue.There were several differences between the original game concept and the one initially published in 1949. In particular, Pratt\\'s original design calls for 10 characters, one of whom was to be designated the victim by random drawing prior to the start of the game. These 10 included the eliminated Mr. Brown, Mr. Gold, Miss Grey, and Mrs. Silver. The characters of Nurse White and Colonel Yellow were renamed Mrs. White and Colonel Mustard for the actual release. The game allowed for play of up to eight remaining characters, providing for nine suspects in total. Originally there were 11 rooms, including the eliminated gun room and cellar. In addition, there were nine weapons, including the unused bomb, syringe, shillelagh (walking stick/cudgel), fireplace poker, and the later used axe and poison. Some of these unused weapons and characters appeared later in spin-off versions of the game.Some gameplay aspects were different as well. Notably, the remaining playing cards were distributed into the rooms to be retrieved, rather than dealt directly to the players. Players also had to land on another player in order to make suggestions about that player\\'s character through the use of special countertokens, and once exhausted, a player could no longer make suggestions. There were other minor differences, all of which were later updated by the game\\'s initial release and remain essentially unchanged in the standard Classic Detective Game editions of the game.The methodology used in the early versions of Cluedo is remarkably similar to a traditional, if little known, American card game, The King of Hearts Has Five Sons. However, Pratt himself said his inspiration was a murder mystery parlour game he used to play with friends in which youngsters \"would congregate in each other\\'s homes for parties at weekends. We\\'d play a stupid game called Murder, where guests crept up on each other in corridors and the victim would shriek and fall on the floor\". The country house mystery was a popular subgenre of \"cosy\" English detective fiction in the 1920s and 1930s; stories were set in a residence of the gentry isolated by circumstances such as a snowstorm with the suspects gathered for a weekend house party. === Marketing === Cluedo was originally marketed as \"The Great New Detective Game\" upon its launch in 1949 in North America. A deal was quickly struck to license \"The Great New Sherlock Holmes Game\" from the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle estate. Advertising at the time suggested players would take on the guise of \"Sherlock Holmes following the path of the criminal\", but no depictions of Holmes appear in the advertising or on the box. From 1950 until the 1960s, the game was marketed as \"The Great Detective Game\", at which time it became the \"Parker Brothers Detective Game\". With the launch of the US 1972 edition, a television commercial showed Holmes and Watson engaged in a particularly competitive game. Adjusting with the times, in 1979 US television commercials a detective, resembling a bumbling Inspector Clouseau from the popular Pink Panther film franchise, looks for clues. In 1986, the marketing slogan added \"Classic Detective Game\" which persists through the last 2002/2003 edition. In the UK, Cluedo was marketed as \"The Great Detective Game\" from the mid-1950s until 2000, when it was rebranded as the \"Classic Detective Game\". However, in the mid-1950s Waddingtons also adopted a Sherlock Holmes-type detective to adorn their box covers for a brief time, though unlike in the US editions, there was no acknowledgement that the character was actually the famous detective. In the 1980s, as in the US, Sherlock Holmes also appeared in TV advertising of the time, along with other classic detectives such as Sam Spade. == Game == === Equipment === The game consists of a board which shows the rooms, corridors and secret-passages of an English country house called Tudor Mansion (named Tudor Close, Tudor Hall, Arlington Grange, Boddy Manor or Boddy Mansion in some editions) in Hampshire, England, in 1926. The game box also includes several coloured playing pieces to represent characters, miniature murder weapon props, two six-sided dice, three sets of cards (describing the aforementioned rooms, characters or weapons), Solution Cards and an envelope (or a mirror in some editions) to contain one card from each set of cards, and a Detective\\'s Notes pad on which are printed lists of rooms, weapons and characters, so players can keep detailed notes during the game. === Characters === The murder victim in the game was known as \"Dr. Black\" in the UK edition and \"Mr. Boddy\" in North American versions. The current UK and North American editions of the game, released by Hasbro in 2023, refer to him as \"Boden \\'Boddy\\' Black Jr.\"Players\\' tokens are typically plastic pawns or figurines; the standard edition of Cluedo has six of these suspects: Miss Scarlett. (The second \"T\" was dropped in North American versions after 1963 and added back in 2016.) She is represented by a red token/figurine. Reverend Green. (\"Mr. Green\" in North America; \"Mayor Green\" in the 2023 UK and North America editions.) He is represented by a green token/figurine. Colonel Mustard. He is represented by a yellow token/figurine. Professor Plum. He is represented by a purple token/figurine. Mrs. Peacock. (\"Solicitor Peacock\" in the 2023 UK and North American editions.) She is represented by a blue token/figurine. Mrs. White. (\"Chef White\" in the 2023 UK and North American editions.) She is represented by a white token/figurine. Dr. Orchid replaced Mrs. White in the North American 2016 edition and is represented by a pink token. Dr. Orchid was replaced by Chef White in the 2023 UK and North American editions. === Weapons === The weapon icons are typically made of unfinished pewter (except the rope, which may be plastic or string); special editions have included gold plated, brass finished and sterling silver versions. Candlestick Dagger (Knife in some North American editions) Lead Pipe (called lead piping in earlier UK editions; the early tokens were made out of actual lead and therefore posed a risk of lead poisoning) Revolver (first depicted in the UK as a Dreyse M1907 semi-automatic pistol, and in North America as a Colt M1911 pistol) Rope Wrench (depicted as a monkey wrench in North American editions and an open-ended spanner in some traditional UK versions) === Rooms === There are nine rooms in the mansion where the murder can take place,: 121 laid out around the edge of the square game board. Each of the four corner rooms contains a secret passage that leads to the room on the opposite diagonal corner of the map. The centre room (often referred to as the Cellar or Stairs) is inaccessible to the players, but contains the solution envelope, and is not otherwise used during game play. Each suspect token has a designated start space marked at the edge of the board. The corridor areas are marked out as square spaces through which the tokens move horizontally or vertically. === Rules === At the beginning of play, three cards—one suspect, one room, and one weapon—are chosen at random and put into a special envelope, so that no one can see them. These cards represent the solution. The remainder of the cards are distributed among the players. Players are instructed to assume the token/suspect nearest them. In older versions, play begins with Miss Scarlett and proceeds clockwise. In modern versions, all players roll the die/dice and the highest total starts the game, with play again proceeding clockwise. Players roll the die/dice and move along the board\\'s corridor spaces, or into the rooms accordingly. The objective of the game is to deduce the details of the murder, i.e. the cards in the envelope. There are six characters, six murder weapons and nine rooms, leaving the players with 324 possibilities. As soon as a player enters a room, they may make a suggestion as to the details, naming a suspect, the room they are in, and weapon. For example: \"I suspect Professor Plum, in the Dining Room, with the candlestick\". The player\\'s suggestions must include the room they are currently in and may not be made in the corridors. The tokens for the suggested suspect and weapon are immediately moved into that room, if they are not both already present. Suggesting an opponent\\'s token is a legitimate board strategy; likewise the weapon icons, though esoteric. A player may even suggest himself or herself as the murderer and may include cards in their own hand. Once a player makes a suggestion, the others are called upon to disprove it. If the player to their left holds any of the three named cards, that player must privately show one (and only one) of the cards to the current player. Otherwise, the process continues clockwise around the table until either one player disproves the accusation, or no one can do so. A player\\'s turn normally ends once their suggestion is completed. A player who believes they have determined the correct elements may make an accusation on their turn. The accusation can include any room, not necessarily the one occupied by the player (if any), and may be made immediately following a suggestion. The accusing player privately checks the three cards in the envelope. If they match the accusation, the player shows them to everyone and wins; if not, the player returns them to the envelope and may not move nor make suggestions/accusations for the remainder of the game; in effect, \"losing\". However, the other players can move their token into rooms when making suggestions and they must continue to privately show cards in order to disprove suggestions. A player who makes a false accusation while blocking the door to a room must move into that room so others can enter and leave. If all players except for one player have made an incorrect accusation, the remaining player automatically wins. If a player\\'s suggestion has brought another player\\'s token into a room, the second player may make their own suggestion in the room when their turn comes up, if desired. If not, they may move out of the room, and if able to reach another room, make a suggestion therein, as usual. In the American version, players are not allowed to make suggestions repeatedly by remaining in one room; if they wish to make a second suggestion, they must first spend a turn out of the room. === Strategy === ==== Choice of playing piece ==== The first opportunity is in choosing the initial playing piece. Mrs. Peacock has an immediate advantage of starting one space closer to the first room than any of the other players. Professor Plum can move to the study, and then take the secret-passage to the Kitchen, the hardest room to reach.Traditionally, Miss Scarlett had the advantage of moving first. This has been eliminated with the implementation of the high roll rule in modern versions. ==== Navigating the board ==== The next opportunity is choice of initial rooms to enter. Again Mrs. Peacock has an advantage in that she is closest to the Conservatory, a corner room with a secret passage, enabling a player on their turn to move immediately to another room and make a suggestion after rolling the dice. Miss Scarlett has a similar advantage with the Lounge. Making as many suggestions as possible maximises how much information a player can gain, which is advantageous. Therefore, moving into a new room as frequently as possible is one way to meet this goal. Players should make good use of the secret passages. Following the shortest path between rooms then is a good choice, even if a player already holds the card representing that room in their hand. As mentioned earlier, blocking passage of another player prevents them from attaining rooms from which to make suggestions. Various single space tracks on the board can therefore become traps, which are best avoided by a player when planning a path from room to room. ==== Making suggestions ==== Each player begins the game with three to six cards in their hand, depending on the number of players. Keeping track of which cards are shown to each player is important in deducing the solution. Detective Notes are supplied with the game to help make this task easier. The pads can keep not only a history of which cards are in a player\\'s hand, but also which cards have been shown by another player. It can also be useful in deducing which cards the other players have shown one another. For example, if Miss Scarlett disproves Rev. Green\\'s accusation that Mrs. Peacock did the crime in the Ballroom with the Candlestick, a player with both the Ballroom and Mrs. Peacock cards in their hand can then deduce that Miss Scarlett has the Candlestick.A player makes a suggestion to learn which cards may be eliminated from suspicion, but in some cases it may be advantageous for a player to include one of their own cards in a suggestion. This technique can be used for both forcing a player to reveal a different card as well as misleading other players into believing a specific card is suspect. Therefore, moving into a room already held in the player\\'s hand may work to their advantage. Suggestions may also be used to thwart a player\\'s opponent. Since every suggestion results in a suspect token being re-located to the suggested room, a suggestion may be used to prevent another player from achieving their intended destination, preventing them from suggesting a particular room, especially if that player appears to be getting close to a solution. ==== Notetaking ==== One reason the game is enjoyed by many ages and skill levels is that the complexity of note-taking can increase as a player becomes more skillful. Beginners may simply mark off the cards they have been shown; more advanced players will keep track of who has and who does not have a particular card, possibly with the aid of an additional grid. Expert players may keep track of each suggestion made, knowing that the player who answers it must have at least one of the cards named, which one can be deduced by later events. One can also keep track of which cards a given player has seen, in order to minimise information revealed to that player and/or to read into that player\\'s suggestions. == Editions == Parker Brothers and Waddingtons each produced their own unique editions between 1949 and 1992. Hasbro purchased both companies in the early 1990s and continued to produce unique editions for each market until 2002/2003 when the current edition of Cluedo/Clue was first released. At this time, Hasbro produced a unified product across markets. The game was then localised with regional differences in spelling and naming conventions. During Cluedo\\'s long history, eight unique Clue editions were published in North America (1949, 1956/1960, 1960/1963, 1972, 1986, 1992, 1996, and 2002), including miniaturised \"travel\" editions. However, only three distinct editions of Cluedo were released in the UK – the longest of which lasted 47 years from its introduction in 1949 until its first successor in 1996. The eighth North America and fourth UK editions constitute the current shared game design. International versions occasionally developed their own unique designs for specific editions, although most drew on the designs and art from either the US or UK editions, and in some cases mixing elements from both, while localising others – specifically suspect portraits.In July 2008, Hasbro released a revamped look for Clue in a Reinvention called \"Clue: Discover the Secrets\". This new version of the game offered major changes to the game play and to the characters and their back stories. In July 2016, Hasbro replaced Mrs. White with a new character, Dr. Orchid, represented by an orchid pink piece. In this current standard edition, Mrs. Peacock has a new game opening opportunity as her starting square is one step closer to the billiard room (with 9 steps instead of 10). The squared off door to the Conservatory makes the room harder for Rev. Green to reach as an opening move and increases the distance between the Ballroom and the Conservatory (from 4 steps to 5). While the suspects\\' appearance and interior design of Dr. Black\\'s/Mr. Boddy\\'s mansion changed with each edition, the weapons underwent relatively minor changes, with the only major redesign occurring in the fourth 1972 US edition, which was adopted by the second 1996 UK edition and remains the standard configuration across all Classic Detective Game versions since. The artwork for the previous US editions tended to reflect the current popular style at the time they were released. The earlier UK editions were more artistically stylised themes. From 1972 on, the US editions presented lush box cover art depicting the six suspects in various candid poses within a room of the mansion. The UK would finally adopt this style only in its third release in 2000, prior to which Cluedo boxes depicted basic representations of the contents. Such lavish box art illustrations have become a hallmark of the game, since copied for the numerous licensed variants which pay homage to Clue. === Cluedo: Discover the Secrets === In August 2008, Hasbro redesigned and updated the board, characters, weapons, and rooms. Changes to the rules of game play were made, some to accommodate the new features. The suspects have new given names and backgrounds, as well as differing abilities that may be used during the game. The revolver is now a pistol, the lead pipe and spanner/wrench have been removed, and a baseball bat, axe, dumbbell, trophy, and poison have been added. The nine rooms have changed to (in clockwise order): Hall, Guest House, Dining Room, Kitchen, Patio, Spa, Theatre, Living Room, and Observatory.There is also a second deck of cards—the Intrigue cards. In this deck, there are two types of cards, Keepers and Clocks. Keepers are special abilities; for example, \"You can see the card\". There are eight clocks—the first seven drawn do nothing—whoever draws the eighth is killed by the murderer and out of the game.The player must move to the indoor swimming pool in the centre of the board to make an accusation. This adds some challenge versus the ability to make accusations from anywhere in the original game. The most significant change to game play is that once the suspect cards have been taken, the remaining cards are dealt so that all players have an even number of cards (rather than dealt out so that \"one player may have a slight advantage\"). This means that depending on the number of players a number of cards are left over. These cards are placed face down in the middle and are not seen unless a player takes a turn in the pool room to look at them. The changes to the game have been criticised in the media, and by fans of the game, for unnecessarily altering classic cultural icons.As of 2017, Hasbro no longer sells the game via its website, but they do continue to sell a version of it as part of their Grab & Go travel series. Notably, it plays identically to standard classic rules, but visually continues to use the new Discover the Secrets room layout, and two of the new weapons, as well as other design artwork. However, the Intrigue cards are no longer a part of the game. === Clue/Cluedo: The Classic Mystery Game === Clue/Cluedo is a digital adaptation based on the official Hasbro board game developed by Marmalade Game Studio for iOS and Android mobile devices as well as Steam and Nintendo Switch. The object of the game is to determine who killed the game\\'s victim Dr. Black (or Mr. Boddy). The player, as one of the six suspects, will ask questions and take notes. The overall goal is to solve the crime first. === Notable editions === Clue \"Master Detective\" (1988), an expanded version of the game featuring 12 rooms, 10 characters, and eight weapons with support for up to 10 players. In addition to the regular cast, Clue Master Detective adds Miss Peach, Monsieur Brunette, Madame Rose, and Sergeant Gray to the list of suspects. It also added poison and a horseshoe to the assortment of weapons. The fountain, the gazebo, and the carriage house were added to the list of rooms. This game is currently published in the USA by Winning Moves Games USA. Cluedo: 50th Anniversary (1999), also released as Clue: 50th Anniversary, this standard edition came in a \"deluxe\" format with the option to play with an extra murder weapon, a bottle of poison. This edition was also issued in a miniaturised Cluedo European travel version. Drew Struzan provided artwork for the game, which was originally created for the US 1996 edition and additionally used for The Limited Gift Edition and the US Clue Card Game, but he did not create the Rev. Green portrait used in the Cluedo editions. Clue \"Nostalgia Edition\" (2003, 2007) is a retro Nostalgia edition of the game, essentially a re-issue of the 1963 design in a wooden box. A custom version of the game was also released in the US by Restoration Hardware as Wooden Box Clue with different cover art. In the UK it was released under the Cluedo brand, and was an official re-issue of the original 1949 Waddingtons\\' design. Clue \"Vintage Edition\" (2005, 2009), also released as Cluedo \"Vintage Edition\", is a re-formatted nostalgia edition into a \"vintage\" bookshelf collection along with a series of other popular boardgames. In the Cluedo version, they continued to use the 1963 design and adapted it for the UK market for the first time with localised characters and naming conventions. == Franchise == The board game spawned a franchise, which since 1985 has expanded to include a feature film, mini-series, a musical, numerous books and several video games. == Worldwide differences == Besides some rule differences listed above, some versions label differently the names of characters, weapons, rooms and in some instances the actual game itself. In Canada and the U.S., the game is known as Clue. It was retitled because the traditional British board game Ludo, on which the name is based, was less well known there than its American variant Parcheesi.The North American versions of Clue also replace the character \"Reverend Green\" from the original Cluedo with \"Mr. Green\". This is the only region to continue to make such a change. Minor changes include \"Miss Scarlett\" with her name being spelt with one \\'t\\', the spanner being called a wrench, and the dagger renamed a knife. In the 2016 U.S. edition, the knife was changed to a dagger. Until 2003, the lead piping was known as the lead pipe only in the North American edition. In some international versions of the game (mostly the Spanish-language ones) the colours of some pieces are different, so as to correspond with the changes to each suspect\\'s unique foreign name variations. In some cases, rooms and weapons are changed in addition to other regional variances.In South America it is licensed and sold under several different names. It is marketed as Detetive in Brazil. == Reception == Games magazine included Clue in their \"Top 100 Games of 1980\", praising it as \"still the classic detective game\".Games magazine included Clue in their \"Top 100 Games of 1981\", noting that the \"characters in this 32-year-old game have become household words\" and that the game is best played with four to six players.Games magazine included Clue in their \"Top 100 Games of 1982\", noting that \"Millions love this classic mystery game\" and that \"it\\'s more satisfying to win through careful deduction than by a lucky stab\". == See also == 13 Dead End Drive (related board game) Clue (1992 video game) Clue (1998 video game) Kill Doctor Lucky (related board game and parody) Orient Express (related board game) Mr. Ree!

              " 'Junonia lemonias, the lemon pansy, is a common nymphalid butterfly found in Cambodia and South Asia. It is found in gardens, fallow land, and open wooded areas. == Description == It is brown with numerous eyespots as well as black and lemon-yellow spots and lines on the upperside of the wings. The underside is a dull brown, with a number of wavy lines and spots in varying shades of brown and black. There is also an eyespot on the lower side of the forewing. The wet- and dry-season forms differ considerably in coloration and even shape. In the wet-season form the markings are distinct and vivid and the wing shape is a little more rounded. In the dry-season form the markings are obscure and pale especially on the underside and the wing margin is more angular and jagged. This helps it camouflage in the dried leaf litter.The lemon pansy is a very active butterfly and can be seen basking with its wings open facing the sun. It sits very low to the ground and can be approached easily. It feeds with its wings half open. It is a fairly strong flier and flies close to the ground with rapid wingbeats and often returns to settle back in the same spots. == Life cycle == === Eggs === Eggs are laid singly on the underside of leaves. The egg is green and barrel shaped with longitudinal ridges. === Caterpillar === The caterpillar is cylindrical, uniformly thick and covered with rows of spines which are branched at the tip. It is dull black with a faint blue sheen and has dorsal stripe of a darker color. There is a distinct orange ring behind the head. The caterpillar stays on the underside of the leaf and if disturbed, rolls up and drops to the ground. === Pupa === Pupation takes place in dense foliage close to the ground. The pupa is compact, with small conical processes on its rough surface. The pupa is well camouflaged with varying shades of brown with fine streaks and lines. === Food plants === Caterpillars feed on plants from the families Acanthaceae, Amaranthaceae, Malvaceae, Rubiaceae, Tiliaceae and Verbenaceae. Recorded species include Alternanthera sessilis, Barleria cristata, Barleria prionitis, Blechum pyramidatum, Cannabis sativa, Corchorus capsularis, Dyschoriste repens, Eranthemum pulchellum, Hemigraphis schomburgkii, Hygrophila auriculata, Hygrophila costata, Hygrophila lancea, Lepidagathis formosensis, Lepidagathis incurva, Nelsonia canescens, Ophiorrhiza japonica, Phyla nodiflora, Ruellia tuberosa, Sida rhombifolia, and Strobilanthes formosanus. == See also == List of butterflies of India == Notes == == References == Evans, W.H.

              " 'Naomi Schor (October 10, 1943 in New York City – December 2, 2001 in New Haven, Connecticut ) was an American literary critic and theorist. A pioneer of feminist theory for her generation, she is regarded as one of the foremost scholars of French literature and critical theory of her time. Naomi\\'s younger sister is the artist and writer Mira Schor. == Early life and education == At the time of her birth, Naomi Schor\\'s Polish-born parents Ilya and Resia Schor were artists who had recently immigrated to the US as refugees from war-torn Europe. Ilya Schor was a painter, jeweler and artist of Judaica, and Resia Schor was a painter who later worked in silver and gold and mixed media on sculptural jewelry and Judaica. The Schors lived among a polyglot community of émigrés, among them musicians, intellectuals, and artists. Naomi Schor’s first language was French, and she went to the Lycée Français de New York where she received her Baccalauréat in 1961, the same year, sadly, that her father died. Schor received her B.A. in English Literature from Barnard College then received her PhD in French Literature from Yale. There Schor occasionally wrote her scholarly essays in French. == Scholarship == Schor was one of the early proponents of French psychoanalytic and deconstructive theory in American literary studies. She wrote about canonical authors such as Émile Zola, Gustave Flaubert, Marcel Proust, Honoré de Balzac, re-examining their work through the double lens of the male-authored theoretical discourse of Jacques Derrida (whom she knew personally), Roland Barthes, and Jacques Lacan, and that of French feminist theoreticians such as Julia Kristeva, Hélène Cixous, and Luce Irigaray. Schor was the founding co-editor of differences: A Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies, in 1989, a critical forum where the problematics of difference is explored in texts ranging from the literary and the visual to the political and social. An area of Schor’s expertise was the work of the feminist psychoanalytic theorist Luce Irigaray. With Carolyn Burke and Margaret Whitford, she edited Engaging with Irigaray, which included essays by Rosi Braidotti, Elizabeth Weed, and Judith Butler. With differences co-founder and co-editor Weed, Schor edited a number of differences books, including The Essential Difference in 1994 and Queer Theory Meets Feminism in 1997. Reading in Detail: Aesthetics and the Feminine is considered one of Schor’s most influential books. In this classic 1987 work of aesthetic and feminist theory, available in a 2006 paperback edition, Schor provided new ways of thinking about the gendering of details and ornament in literature, art, and architecture. In other writings she developed the concept of female fetishism, in her many writings on the work of George Sand; she examined the question of idealism, also in relation to Sand, and in her late writings and research revisited the concept of universalism in an era of identity politics and difference. == Awards and honors == Schor was the recipient of numerous awards and honors, including a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship (1963–64), a number of Fulbright Award Fellowships to France, NEH Fellowships (1981 and 1990–91), a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1990: She was also elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1997. Schor taught at Columbia, Brown (from 1978 to 1989) where she held the Nancy Duke Lewis Chair from 1985 to 1989, Duke where she was the William Hanes Wannamaker Professor of Romance Studies Chair, and Harvard. At the time of her death (of a brain hemorrhage) Schor was the Benjamin F. Barge professor of French at Yale.Naomi Schor’s papers are part of the Pembroke Center Archive\\'s Elizabeth Weed Feminist Theory Papers collection, held at the John Hay Library at Brown University. == Personal life == At the time of her death she was married to R. Howard Bloch, Sterling Professor of French and Chair of the Humanities Program at Yale. A first marriage, to Breton poet Paol Keineg, ended in divorce. == Works == === Books === Bad Objects: Essays Popular and Unpopular, Duke University Press, 1995.

              " 'Thomas Charles Buckland McLeish (1 May 1962 – 27 February 2023) was a British theoretical physicist. His work is renowned for increasing understanding of the properties of soft matter. This is matter that can be easily changed by stress – including liquids, foams and biological materials. He was professor in the Durham University Department of Physics and director of the Durham Centre for Soft Matter, a multidisciplinary team that works across physics, chemistry, mathematics and engineering. He also was the first Chair of Natural Philosophy at the University of York. == Early life and education == McLeish was born on 1 May 1962. He was educated at Sevenoaks School in Kent and Emmanuel College, Cambridge where he was awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1984 (MA, 1987) and a PhD in 1987 for research on fluid dynamics. == Academic career == McLeish began his academic career as a lecturer in physics at the University of Sheffield (1989 to 1993). He then moved to the University of Leeds, where he was Professor of Polymer Physics between 1993 and 2008. He was Professor of Physics at the University of Durham from 2008 to 2018. He was additionally Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Research between 2008 and 2014.In February 2018, McLeish moved to the University of York to take up the newly created Chair in Natural Philosophy. === Research === Although McLeish\\'s work was mostly theoretical, he also worked closely with those performing experiments and in industry. He made significant advances in modelling the structure and properties of complex entangled molecules, blends of substances that don\\'t usually mix (multiphasic liquids like oil and water - see reptation and crazing). This allows complex fluid behaviour and processing in an industrial setting to be more easily predicted. Since 2000 he worked on biological physics: applying soft matter physics to self-assembly of protein fibrils, protein fluctuation dynamics and its role in allosteric signalling, and statistical mechanics approaches to evolution. As of 2015 he had published around 200 papers in peer reviewed scientific journals. == Personal life == In 1984, McLeish married Julie Elizabeth King. Together they had four children: two sons and two daughters.McLeish\\'s other interests included historical studies of medieval science, and he was a member of the Institute of Medieval and Early Modern Studies at Durham. In 1993, he became a lay preacher in the Anglican Church, delivering sermons at St Michael le Belfrey, York. In 2014, he published a book on the relationship between religion and science called Faith and Wisdom in Science.McLeish died on 27 February 2023, at the age of 60. == Honours == McLeish was made a Fellow of the Institute of Physics (FInstP) in 2003, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry (FRSC) in 2008. In 2011, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS), the United Kingdom\\'s national academy of the sciences.In 2007, McLeish was awarded the Weissenberg medal by the European Society of Rheology. This is awarded to rheologists conducting research in Europe for outstanding, long-term achievements. McLeish also received the Society of Rheology\\'s Bingham Medal in 2010. In 2017, McLeish received the Sam Edwards Medal and Prize for \"his sustained and outstanding contributions to the fields of molecular rheology, macromolecular biophysics and self-assembly\".In 2018, McLeish was awarded the Lanfranc Award for Education and Scholarship by the Archbishop of Canterbury \"for his record as one of the most outstanding scientists of his generation, and the leading contemporary lay Anglican voice in the dialogue of science and faith\".McLeish gave the 2021 Boyle Lecture (International Society for Science and Religion, ISSR) entitled \"Rediscovering Science as Contemplation.\" A recording is available on the ISSR\\'s YouTube channel. == Selected publications == The Poetry and Music of Science: Comparing Creativity in Science and Art (2019) OXFORD University Press, ISBN 9780198797999 Soft Matter – An Emergent Interdisciplinary Science of Emergent Entities, Chapter 20 in The Routledge Handbook of Emergence, (eds.)

              " \"Bromophenol blue (3′,3″,5′,5″-tetrabromophenolsulfonphthalein, BPB), albutest is used as a pH indicator, an electrophoretic color marker, and a dye. It can be prepared by slowly adding excess bromine to a hot solution of phenolsulfonphthalein in glacial acetic acid. == Acid–base indicator == As an acid–base indicator, its useful range lies between pH 3.0 and 4.6. It changes from yellow at pH 3.0 to blue at pH 4.6; this reaction is reversible. Bromophenol blue is structurally related to phenolphthalein (a popular indicator). == Color marker == Bromophenol is also used as a colour marker to monitor the process of agarose gel electrophoresis and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Since bromophenol blue carries a slight negative charge at moderate pH, it will migrate in the same direction as DNA or protein in a gel; the rate at which it migrates varies according to gel density and buffer composition, but in a typical 1% agarose gel in a 1X TAE buffer or TBE buffer, bromophenol blue migrates at the same rate as a DNA fragment of about 300 base pairs, in 2% agarose as 150 bp. Xylene cyanol and orange G may also be used for this purpose. == Dye == Bromophenol blue is also used as a dye. At neutral pH, the dye absorbs red light most strongly and transmits blue light. (Its peak absorbance is 600 nm at a basic pH of 12.) Solutions of the dye, therefore, are blue. At low pH, the dye absorbs ultraviolet and blue light most strongly and appears yellow in solution. In solution at pH 3.6 (in the middle of the transition range of this pH indicator) obtained by dissolution in water without any pH adjustment, bromophenol blue has a characteristic green red colour, where the apparent colour shifts depending on the concentration and/or path length through which the solution is observed. This phenomenon is called dichromatic color. Bromophenol blue is the substance with the highest known value of Kreft's dichromaticity index. This means it has the largest change in colour hue, when the thickness or concentration of observed sample increases or decreases. == See also == Bromophenol == References == == External links == Bromophenol blue at OpenWetWare\",\n",
              " \"Helene Mullins (July 12, 1899 - October 26, 1991) was an American poet whose work appeared frequently in magazines and newspapers across the United States during the 1920s and 1930s. Much of it was syndicated through Franklin Pierce Adams' Conning Tower column published in the New York World newspaper. Mullins published four collections of poetry: Earthbound and Other Poems (1929), Balm in Gilead (1930), Streams from the Source (1938), and The Mirrored Walls and Other Poems (1970). She authored two novels early in her career: Paulus Fy: the History of an Aesthete (1924), co-written with her sister, Marie Gallegher, and Convent Girl (1929). Mullins' work was included in Modern American Poetry: A Critical Anthology by Louis Untermeyer in 1930.Helene Mullins (née Gallegher) was born in New Rochelle, New York. Aside from some time spent in Hollywood, Santa Fe, and Washington DC, the poet lived most of her adult life in New York City. Mullins was married twice, first to Ivan Mullins in 1920, and then to Linné Johnson in 1958. Helene Mullins' poetry has been compared to that of Christina Rossetti. Her writing was compact, intense, lyrical, and often spiritual. Mullins wrote in a somewhat old-fashioned style for her time, but her poetry nonetheless had a modern sensibility, and it was accessible to the wide audience it reached in Scribner's Magazine, The Atlantic Monthly, The New Yorker, and in wide syndication through the New York World newspaper. In 1927, Mullins was commissioned by the American Opera Company, along with The New Yorker music critic Robert A. Simon, to create a new English libretto for Carmen. The opera's new libretto was performed widely across North America over the next few years.In 1935, Mullins suffered serious injuries when she was struck by a car while crossing the street. She was in a coma for several weeks, and she took several years to recover.Helene Mullins died in 1991, in Manhattan, at the age of 92. == References == == External links == Helene Mullins Archives at Yale - https://archives.yale.edu/agents/people/96767 Pacific Radio Archives recorded interview - https://www.pacificaradioarchives.org/recording/bb3895\",\n",

              " 'The Mormon Reformation was a period of renewed emphasis on spirituality within the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), and a centrally-directed movement, which called for a spiritual reawakening among church members. It took place during 1856 and 1857 and was under the direction of church president Brigham Young. During the Reformation, Young sent his counselor, Jedediah M. Grant, and other church leaders to preach to the people throughout Utah Territory and surrounding Latter-day Saint communities with the goal of inspiring them to reject sin and turn towards spiritual things. During this time, some of the most conservative or reactionary elements of LDS Church doctrine came to dominate public discussion. As part of the Reformation, almost all \"active\" or involved LDS Church members were rebaptized as a symbol of their commitment. The Reformation is considered in three phases: a structural reform phase, a phase of intense demand for a demonstration of spiritual reform, and a final phase during which an emphasis was placed on love and reconstruction. == History == === Economic and spiritual issues === All pioneers who gathered to the Utah Territory between 1847 and the mid-1850s under the direction of Brigham Young, whether members of the LDS Church or sympathetic non-members, were welcome as long as they helped to build up Zion. Developing the land required heavy physical labor. Church members who were willing to physically strengthen the Mormon settlements were so valued that \"problems they might have with smoking, drinking, profaning, Sabbath breaking, and even immoral living did not normally cost them their standing in the community and the Church.\" Consequently, by the early 1850s, many communities within the Mormon settlement region were prosperous and secure, yet contained a segment of inhabitants whose personal practices were not within the exacting standards of the LDS Church.In 1852, Brigham Young felt that the church in Utah was secure enough to announce the practice of plural marriage to the world. Shortly after the announcement, however, the Latter-day Saints in Utah experienced a period of hardship. The population of the Utah territory had increased rapidly as converts from Europe joined American Saints in their migration across the Great Plains. In 1855, a drought struck, due to light snowfall during the winter of 1854. In addition to the damage caused by drought, an infestation of grasshoppers and crickets destroyed their meager crops, and around a third of the valley\\'s cattle perished due to the cold. During the winter of 1855–56, flour and other basic necessities were very scarce and very costly. Heber C. Kimball wrote his son, \"Dollars and cents do not count now, in these times, for they are the tightest that I have ever seen in the territory of Utah.\" === Involvement of church leaders === In September 1856, as the drought continued, the trials and difficulties of the previous year led to an explosion of intense soul-searching. Church leaders had viewed the economic disasters of the previous years as acts of God, and sensed that something was needed to assist the Saints in their quest for temporal survival and spiritual salvation. Brigham Young, at a church meeting on September 21, 1856, stated: \"We need a reformation in the midst of this people; we need a thorough reform.\"Jedediah M. Grant, a counselor in the First Presidency and a well-known conservative voice, took interest in the cause. He has been described by contemporary authors as being sensible, generous, well-educated, and given to robust oratory, all of which aided the Reformation. At a quarterly conference in Kaysville, Utah, Grant and Joseph Young of the First Council of the Seventy delivered various sermons over the span of four days, calling for repentance and a general recommitment to moral living and religious teachings. Five hundred people presented themselves for rebaptism as a symbol of their determination to reform their lives. The zealous message spread from Kaysville to surrounding Mormon communities. Church leaders traveled around the territory, expressing their concern about signs of spiritual decay and \"backsliding\", and calling for repentance. Members were asked to seal their rededication with rebaptism, and a new baptismal font was dedicated on the east side of the Endowment House on Temple Square for the purpose of rebaptism. Rebaptism as a practice was not unique to the Reformation, and the practice, which had begun in the 1830s, continued to be commonplace throughout the nineteenth century. It was later discouraged by the First Presidency in 1879.The meetings conducted by Grant and Young during the Reformation were similar to those held during the 1830s when the saints resided in Ohio, contained the same types of religious experiences. These types of manifestations, however, had largely been absent from the Nauvoo and earlier Utah experiences, such as speaking in tongues, prophesying, and seeing visions. The Reformation was endorsed by all three members of the First Presidency, as well as several apostles, who gave fiery sermons in favor of greater orthodoxy, and rebaptism in preparation for the full practice of \"celestial law\" in Utah Territory prior to the Second Coming, which they suspected would be soon. Brigham Young played a key role in the circulation of the Mormon Reformation with his emphasis on plural marriage, rebaptism, and passionate preaching and oration. He also introduced various controversial doctrines, such as blood atonement and the Adam-God doctrine, both of which were rejected by other church leaders. According to Brigham Young: \"The time is coming when justice will be laid to the line and righteousness to the plummet; when we shall take the old broadsword and ask, Are you for God? And if you are not heartily on the Lord\\'s side, you will be hewn down.\"By the end of September of 1856, the Reformation had gained enough momentum to carry it to the rest of the Mormon settlements. Throughout the winter, special meetings were held, and church members urged each other to adhere to the commandments of God and the practices and precepts of the church. Preaching placed special emphasis on the practice of plural marriage, adherence to the Word of Wisdom, attendance at church meetings, and personal prayer. Various sermons also focused on improving personal appearance, dress, and hygiene. In one sermon, Jedediah Grant urged members to uphold their baptismal covenants through \"observing cleanliness in their persons and dwellings, setting their families in order, [and] carefully cultivating their farms and gardens...\" Although Grant died of pneumonia in December 1856 at age forty, shortly after one of his winter tours, the influence of the Reformation spread throughout the Mormon colonies and settlements. On December 30, 1856, the entire all-Mormon Utah territorial legislature was rebaptized for the remission of their sins, and reconfirmed under the hands of the Twelve Apostles.To encourage reformation, certain adjunct theocratic committees may have attempted to ensure order and conformity by censuring local troublemakers. Dissident Mormons of the time reported rumors that committees resorted to summary judgments with punishments meted out by enforcers colloquially termed \"Danites\" or \"destroying angels\". For example, the southern Utah pioneer and militia scout of the time John Chatterley later wrote that he had received threats from \"secret Committee, called... \\'destroying angels\\'\" in late 1856 and early 1857. Contemporary commentators have pointed to pronouncements during the period by Brigham Young and Jedediah Grant that would seem to give vigilante-style bloodshed a religious basis. Young denied that any such acts were condoned by him or the church leadership. In a speech in 1867 Young said: Is there war in our religion? No; neither war nor bloodshed. Yet our enemies cry out \"bloodshed,\" and \"oh, what dreadful men these Mormons are, and those Danites! how they slay and kill!\" Such is all nonsense and folly in the extreme. The wicked slay the wicked, and they will lay it on the Saints. The Reformation also had an effect on the culture and society that had begun to develop among the Mormon community in Utah, due in large part to the Polysophical Society, which had been organized in 1854 by Lorenzo Snow and his sister, Eliza R. Snow. The society promoted large-scale public education through lectures, musical presentations, literature readings, and poetry writing. At the beginning of the Reformation, Jedediah M. Grant and Heber C. Kimball attacked the society, with Grant saying that it possessed an \"adulterous spirit\". In a possible tongue-in-cheek diary entry, Hannah Tapfield King responded to Grant\\'s. King wrote, \"Well, there may be, for he says there is, and probably he understands it. To me it all seemed good and nice, of course a little vanity and folly, and that one sees in the tabernacle and everywhere.\"Historian Dean L. May noted that the more zealous reformation efforts were not universally accepted in Utah. As in similar American religious reformation and revival movements, the enormous enthusiasm and dramatic signs of repentance could not be sustained. By the spring of 1857, with the return of more familiar spring rains, the religious life of Mormon communities returned to a more normal pattern. The Reformation appeared to have ended completely by early 1858. == Blood atonement == Several sermons by Willard Richards and George A. Smith that had been delivered earlier in the history of the LDS Church had touched on the concept of blood atonement. The idea of blood atonement was that apostates and those who committed certain sins, such as murder, were beyond the saving power of the blood of Christ and could be redeemed only by the voluntary shedding of their own blood. In a sermon given in March of 1856, just before the start of the Reformation, Brigham Young preached that the death and Atonement of Jesus Christ could not cleanse endowed members of the church of certain transgressions, such as adultery, apostasy, and first-degree murder. For these offenses, Young believed that only the voluntary offering of the sinner\\'s own life would be able to expunge the sin. On September 21, 1856, while calling for sincere repentance by church members, Brigham Young took the idea further, stating: \"I know that there are transgressors, who, if they knew themselves and the only condition upon which they can obtain forgiveness, would beg of their brethren to shed their blood, that the smoke might ascend to God as an offering to appease the wrath that is kindled against them, and that the law might have its course.\"Young reiterated the concept in several other sermons during the Reformation period. Although the belief was never widely accepted by church members, it became part of the public image of the church at the time and was pilloried, along with the practice of polygamy, in newspapers in the Eastern United States. During the subsequent history of the church, the concept was frequently criticized by church members, given that both the Book of Mormon and church doctrine teach that the sacrifice of Christ forms part of an \"infinite atonement\". Blood atonement was formally repudiated as church doctrine by a manifesto published in the Deseret Weekly in 1889, and again by a letter published by apostle Bruce R. McConkie speaking on behalf of the First Presidency in 1978. == Impact == In addition to the Reformation\\'s appeal to the spiritual and emotional lives of Latter-day Saints, actions taken during the movement had lasting impacts on church members, their families, and the church organization. Among the main outcomes of the Reformation were personal recommitment, communal economic innovation, strengthened unity among church members, and an increase in the number of those entering plural marriage. Gustive O. Larson writes that \"Mormonism was a civilizing force at work in the Great Basin. Not unlike the experience of some other Christian communities, it threshed its harvest of converts vigorously, lost some of them together with the tares, but produced thereby a better product. The call to repentance in the Reformation was generally heeded and as a result, in the words of historian Andrew Neff, \\'the spiritual tone of the entire Mormon commonwealth was markedly raised.\\'\"According to historian Paul H. Peterson, the pledges of conformity with church practices led to a measurable increase in plural marriages throughout the Mormon region. Many men who had previously resisted plural marriages were sealed to one or more plural wives. Stanley S. Ivins\\'s statistical research reveals that the number of plural marriages in relation to population was 65 percent higher in 1856–57 than in any other two-year period in Utah history.The Reformation also resulted in an increase in practical and emotional unity among church members. Historians James Allen and Glen Leonard point out that the Reformation \"may have accounted for the fact that the following year the Saints were emotionally prepared to confront the army of the United States en route to Utah.\" During the conflict, known as the Utah War, Mormon militia were asked to engage in diversionary action on the plains and in Wyoming. Also, church members were prepared, under Brigham Young\\'s direction, to abandon and destroy their homes, farms, and businesses and move again to the White Mountains of Arizona, which Young had selected as a possible place of refuge if full-scale war were to begin. Historians have also asserted that the emotional rhetoric of church leaders contributed to the defensive dialogue and actions in Southern Utah, which ultimately burst forth in the Mountain Meadows massacre.Additionally, leaders at church headquarters established a policy of assigning two \"home\" or ward missionaries in each congregational unit. A similar program still exists today within the LDS Church in the form of ministering (formerly known as visiting or home teaching), though much has changed since the Reformation. Ward missionaries were asked to visit each family in the ward, assess their material needs, and provide help wherever possible. They were also asked to inquire into family members\\' spiritual commitment, including asking searching questions about religious practices. After some months of these missionary visits, Latter-day Saints in Salt Lake City and surrounding communities who had not yet been rebaptized were asked to do so as an expression of their ongoing commitment to the church. Paul H. Peterson asserts that those who refused to be rebaptized might \"lose their membership in the church. In Britain, zealous application of Reformation principles resulted in trimming from church rolls a large number of the less-committed.\" A modest number of less zealous church members left the Utah area, returning to the east or traveling on to California. == See also == History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Morrisite War == Notes == == Further reading == Grant, Jedediah M.

              " 'Alexander Williamson Dobbie (12 November 1843 – 18 July 1912) was a Scots-born South Australian brassfounder, engineer, inventor, lecturer, mesmerist, businessman and travel writer. He founded A. W. Dobbie & Co. manufacturing company, and the hardware and homewares store Dobbie\\'s, which continued into the 1960s in Adelaide and the 1930s in Perth, Western Australia. == History == Alexander Williamson Dobbie was born in Glasgow, a son of William Dobbie (1813 – 12 January 1879), jeweller and engraver, and his wife Sophia Monteith Dobbie (c. 1817 – 9 September 1884). Alex was schooled at James Bath\\'s school in North Adelaide, then at age 14, after a few months as a draper\\'s assistant, was in 1858 apprenticed to machinist and brassfounder G. Schwan, formerly of Berends & Schwan, of Gawler Place, 3 doors from Rundle street, who went out of business in 1860. It is likely that he completed his apprenticeship with, and worked for, another brassfounder, perhaps Richard Hutchinson. At age 19 began working on his own account, in premises on Gawler Place. === Parents and siblings === Thomas Dobbie and William Dobbie and their families arrived on 5 March 1851 at Port Adelaide on the Three Bells, an iron ship of 640 tons from Glasgow.The Scots born children of William Dobbie and his wife Sophia Monteith Dobbie née Minto were: Thomas Dobbie (9 June 1836 – 19 December 1886) married Matilda Louisa Barns née Ladd (1859 – 1938), daughter of J. O. Ladd, on 31 May 1884 John Forgie Dobbie (c. 1837 – 13 November 1870 in New Zealand) William Dobbie, jr., (c. 1835 – 28 April 1908) married Janet James (c. 1843–1932) in Melbourne on 19 January 1866 Alexander Williamson Dobbie (1843–1912) James Dobbie (1846–1879)five more children were born in South Australia: Grace Gardner Dobbie (1851– ) married Henry John Thompson on 10 April 1873, Robert Tulloch Dobbie (1853 – c. 21 August 1919) married Anne Frood Cornish \"Annie\" Champion ( –1909) on 22 November 1877 Francis Dobbie (1857– ) Henry (8 January 1862 – 1867) married Louisa Emma Strother in 1895 Alice Maud Dobbie (26 November 1867 – )William Dobbie Sr., was a partner with John Wald in Wald & Dobbie, watchmakers & jewellers of 83 Rundle Street, 1865–1866, then sole trading jeweller of Gawler Place. He died at his home in Charles Street, Norwood on 12 January 1879 and James died at his home in West Street, Unley on 10 December 1879. Advertisements in the name of A. & J. Dobbie continued to appear well into the next decade. === Manufacturing === In July 1864 he moved to premises \"adjacent to Padman & Co.\", Gawler Place. His company won a silver medal at the Exhibition held in conjunction with Prince Alfred\\'s visit in 1867. The articles exhibited included the brass level used by the Prince in laying the foundation stone for the Victoria Tower, and a pair of \"transit Y\"s used by Charles Todd in his role as Government Astronomer. The company began electro-plating around 1870. The business suffered two serious incidents that could have had tragic consequences: Their apparatus used for generating the oxygen needed for high-temperature welding was a retort charged with potassium chlorate and manganese dioxide as a catalyst. This is a time-honored and inexpensive way of producing oxygen but critically relies on purity of the reagents concerned. One day in July 1866, the catalyst must have been contaminated, perhaps with graphite or antimony, as the apparatus exploded, blowing out part of a wall, the ceiling, doors and a window. Fortunately no-one was in the workshop at the time, as serious injury or death would have been almost certain. In January 1874 a fire broke out in the foundry, and all the irreplaceable patterns were destroyed, but by prompt action by the fire department, the fire did not spread to the rest of the building or those adjacent.Among the articles cast by Dobbie was a set of handbells, to patterns made by George Marshall of Waymouth Street. Also produced in the factory were highly-finished brass \"church furniture\": crosses, candlesticks, vases, alms dishes and lecterns. During a visit to the United States at the time of the 1876 Philadelphia Exposition, Alex Dobbie became an enthusiast for their technology, with the result that the Gawler Place shop began advertising a diverse range of American \"tools, novelties and general machinery\".They began developing and manufacturing farm machinery with a patented broadcast seed-sower, and took out patents for improvements to pumps and chaffcutters in 1877. Having absorbed the principles behind the invention of the telephone, he developed similar instruments which he and Charles Todd demonstrated at an Adelaide Philosophical Society exhibition at the Adelaide Town Hall in 1878.In 1876 he was involved in the process of standardizing hose couplings used by fire brigades throughout South Australia.In 1885 he erected a new two-storey building behind the showroom in Gawler Place, and a new foundry building on the Pirie Street corner, just in time to satisfy a major Government contract in connection with an expansion of Adelaide\\'s water reticulation system.Dobbie & Co. began manufacturing their own \"Standard\" brand of bicycle around 1895, and carried several other brands of US and UK manufacture. === Business and retail === His manufacturing business was profitable, but it was the sale of goods imported from Britain and, especially, America that made him wealthy. In 1868 he began advertising sewing machine repairs along with brassfounding and electroplating, and later became an sales outlet for several manufacturers. In 1871 he founded the \"Adelaide Sewing Machine Depot\", and in July 1872 erected new showrooms and workshop, with 25 different makers\\' machines on display.Alex\\'s younger brother James, who had training as a machinist (perhaps with A. Simpson & Son), joined the firm some time before August 1873. James Williamson Dobbie (12 January 1846 – 10 December 1879) married Sarah Elizabeth Revell ( – 1933) on 26 December 1867. They were to have five children: Alfred Simpson Dobbie (11 June 1870 – ), Edgar Allan Dobbie (15 July 1871 – 1934), Florence Edith Dobbie (1873–) married Robert William Tayler in 1896, Horace Leeson Dobbie (3 July 1874 – ), Walter Campbell Dobbie (18 July 1876 – 1947) married Edith Rosalie Wright in 1903, and Elsie Revell Dobbie (5 February 1878 – 26 June 1942) married Charles Basil Sheidow on 1 March 1913. She was a highly successful teacher.As A. & J. Dobbie, and \"Adelaide Sewing Machine Depot\" they sold and repaired various makes of sewing machine, also advertising revolvers and guns \"for the Northern Territory\", and \"brassfounding carried on as usual\".The shop in Gawler Place diversified even further, selling Swedish \"Domo\" cream separators, Zonophone gramophone records, American Mason & Hamlin organs and Chickering and the cheaper (German) Fritz Kuhla pianos, and much else. American Waterbury watches, English Brinsmead and German Neumeyer pianos, and Wertheim sewing machines were popular and profitable lines. In 1895 a branch of the company was established at 307–309, Hay Street east, in Perth, Western Australia, and in 1898 opened showrooms closer to the centre of town at 459 Hay Street, with agencies in Kalgoorlie, Fremantle and Bunbury. A grandiose new showroom at 580–582 Hay Street was opened in 1906. The Western Australian factory closed in the 1920s after adverse rulings on tradesmen\\'s and apprentices\\' pay, and retail operations were taken over by Arthur W. Lushey in 1932.Around 1903 the firm was restructured as a private company jointly owned by Alexander Williamson Dobbie, James Edward Molloy Morley, Alexander Herbert Dobbie and Hector John Dobbie. Hector died in 1906 and the partnership was dissolved in December 1910. === Other interests === His home in College Park was well known for its profusion of mechanical and scientific gadgets and curiosities, and his garden, where he grew an abundance of prize-winning flowers. He was a prominent member of the Royal Agricultural Society, Photographic Society (vice president in 1895 and president in 1896 and 1897), League of the Empire, Adelaide Philosophical Society, Adelaide Benevolent and Strangers\\' Friend Society, Royal Geographical Society, Chamber of Manufactures, director of Broken Hill Proprietary, and from age 18 an adherent of the Wesleyan Methodist church and a Sunday School superintendent for 10 years, latterly at the Kent Town church. A proud Scotsman, he was a founding member of the Royal Caledonian Society of South Australia.He was member of the General Committee and the Executive of both Prince Alfred College and the Methodist Ladies\\' College.Largely self-educated, he was by some dubbed \"Adelaide\\'s Edison\" for his inventiveness, absorption in his work, and his absent-mindedness. Influenced by his friend and kindred spirit D. B. Adamson, he took a great interest in astronomy. He built several telescopes from instructions found in English Mechanic magazine. His first, completed in 1874, had a 6.5 inches (17 cm) (glass, not speculum metal) reflector, and his second, which took 11 years to complete, had a 12.5 inches (32 cm) diameter reflector, the largest privately owned telescope in Australia. He ground and silvered (to a method expounded by John Browning) the mirror himself, and cast and turned the mount and all the mechanism, all in brass of course. In 1895 he demonstrated projection of stereoscopic images using red and green filters on the two oxy-hydrogen projectors. The following year he demonstrated X-ray photography in conjunction with Professor W. H. Bragg. He experimented with the \"audiphone\", by which some deaf persons were able to hear by amplified sound being transmitted through the teeth.He gave many lectures on scientific and occult subjects and gave demonstrations on hypnosis, or mesmerism, which he treated seriously rather than as a stage act. He was an expert hypnotist, and on several occasions demonstrated its use in dentistry. He was particularly interested in the phenomenon of clairvoyance apparently exhibited by hypnotised subjects.He undertook at least two world tours, in 1876 and 1888 or 1889, the subjects of two books, each titled Rough Notes of a Traveller . . .. He also toured India in 1893–1894 and New Guinea and South Pacific islands in 1899. During this latter trip he contracted malaria, from which he never fully recovered.He was one of a party sent by the Royal Astronomical Society under G. F. Dodwell to Bruni Island, off Tasmania, to document the total solar eclipse of 9 May 1910, when the period of totality was over 3 minutes. Dobbie used his 12-inch and 6-inch reflectors with special long focal-length cameras to record the sun\\'s coronas, a subject of intense interest. === Later history === Alexander Williamson Dobbie died at his residence, \"Rothesay Villa\", Baliol Street, College Park.Alexander Herbert Dobbie (25 July 1875 – 1965) took over the firm as managing director. He was a member of Chamber of Manufactures (vice-president in 1925), on the board of the Advisory Council of Education 1920, the State Advisory Council of Science and Industry, and a prominent member of the East Adelaide Lawn Tennis Club. He retired as chairman of directors in 1951. Later manufactures include a range of spraying equipment and irrigation fittings. \"Dobbie Dico Meter Co. Ltd\" was founded in 1935 or earlier, with premises in Sultram Place, off Sturt Street, Adelaide, making water meters, many of which may still be seen on South Australian properties. The retail store in Gawler Place was incorporated into the Savery group of companies but continued to trade independently into the 1960s.In 1940 A. H. Dobbie and William \"Bill\" Bardon ( – October 1972) established \"Dobbie Dico Meter Co.\" (DDMC) a brass foundry in Wittenoom Street, East Perth to manufacture water meters for the Western Australian market, and also had useful contracts with the US Navy dockyards in WA during World War II and later. In 1952 the company acquired the nearby company of Kay & Heron, an iron and steel foundry. By this time the company was \"Dobbie\" in name only. In 1961 Dobbie Dico began manufacture of \"Eclipse\" brand fire extinguishers and other fire protection products. With his death, Bill\\'s son Stan Bardon ( – 2004) took over the company and in March 1998, with the expansion of suburban Perth, they moved to new larger premises at 430 Victoria Road, Málaga, some 10 km north of Perth\\'s CBD, where they continue to this day under Stan Bardon\\'s son Phil Bardon, manufacturing civil water engineering products. == Family == Alexander Dobbie married Esther Catherine Elizabeth Wallis (c. 1845 – 10 October 1925) on 6 June 1865. Their family included: Sarah Grace Dobbie (3 November 1867 – 1935) married Richard Sutton on 10 April 1892 Alexander Herbert Dobbie (25 July 1875 – 1965) married Florence Colebatch ( –1950) on 16 April 1902. He and John H. M. Hawkes were in October 1921 appointed to the State Advisory Council on Science and Industry. Hector John Dobbie (20 October 1879 – 20 April 1906) educated at Prince Alfred College and the School of Mines, named as co-inventor on several patents, he was dying of tuberculosis when he cut his own throat. Emilie Sophia Dobbie (7 January 1882 – 4 November 1914) married Lloyd Mervyn Hodge ( – ) on 30 August 1909 Leonard Campbell Dobbie (24 March 1884 – ), farmer and orchardist, married Natalie Lucy Barritt (died 1951) on 27 August 1908, lived at Tawah and Degilbo, near Biggenden then Cottonvale and retired to Mount Tamborine, Queensland. Malcolm Monteith Dobbie (12 March 1890 – 1939) married Effie Muriel Huskisson ( – 1940) on 17 February 1920, lived at Maylands, South Australia == Bibliography == A. W.

              " 'Thomas Bang (born 6 September 1938) is a Danish sculptor who in the 1970s contributed to Conceptual art and Pop art in the United States. == Biography == Born in Copenhagen, as a young man Bang became interested in Surrealism as practised by Giorgio de Chirico, Max Ernst and Yves Tanguy. After he moved to the United States with his parents, he studied art at the University of Cincinnati (1958–59), the Cleveland Institute of Art (1959–61), Yale University (1961–62), and the University of Southern California (1962–64). He soon became part of the American experimental art scene which covered Minimal Art, Conceptual Art and Pop Art. He exhibited with pioneers in the field including Carl André, Richard Serra, Jasper Johns, Frank Stella, Sol LeWitt and Bruce Nauman.Working in an existentialist approach with modest materials, the fragment is a recurring theme and concepts include construction and destruction, open and closed, covering and uncovering, structure and process. His work has addressed the potential of the object, representing absurd perceptions of dissonance in our attempts to achieve harmony between ourselves and our surroundings. From the late 1960s, three-dimensional objects cover transitions from painting to free-standing works. He exhibited them in the United States in leading museums together with other pioneers such as Robert Morris, Eva Hesse and Joel Shapiro. By the 1970s, he was producing long square-shaped plaster objects standing on the floor or up against the walls which contained covered or partly covered rolls of steel wire. In the 1980s, his works became more complex while in the 1990s he worked in larger formats, creating mainly wooden objects adorned with metal, wax and paint, sometimes with additional strips of plastic or cloth.Bang had a professorship at the University of Rochester in New York State from 1970 to 1991. He has exhibited widely in the United States, Germany and Denmark. His work can be seen in collections in Europe and the United States. == Awards == In 1990, Bang was awarded the Eckersberg Medal and, in 2000, the Thorvaldsen Medal. == References == == External links == Illustrated portrait of Thomas Bang (in Danish) from KunstOnline Illustrated list of works by Thomas Bang in Danish museums from Kunstindeks Danmark',\n",

              " 'Gloger\\'s rule is an ecogeographical rule which states that within a species of endotherms, more heavily pigmented forms tend to be found in more humid environments, e.g. near the equator. It was named after the zoologist Constantin Wilhelm Lambert Gloger, who first remarked upon this phenomenon in 1833 in a review of covariation of climate and avian plumage color. Erwin Stresemann later noted that the idea had been expressed even earlier by Peter Simon Pallas in Zoographia Rosso-Asiatica (1811). Gloger found that birds in more humid habitats tended to be darker than their relatives from regions with higher aridity. Over 90% of 52 North American bird species studies conform to this rule.One explanation of Gloger\\'s rule in the case of birds appears to be the increased resistance of dark feathers to feather- or hair-degrading bacteria such as Bacillus licheniformis. Feathers in humid environments have a greater bacterial load, and humid environments are more suitable for microbial growth; dark feathers or hair are more difficult to break down. More resilient eumelanins (dark brown to black) are deposited in hot and humid regions, whereas in arid regions, pheomelanins (reddish to sandy color) predominate due to the benefit of crypsis. Among mammals, there is a marked tendency in equatorial and tropical regions to have a darker skin color than poleward relatives. In this case, the underlying cause is probably the need to better protect against the more intense solar UV radiation at lower latitudes. However, absorption of a certain amount of UV radiation is necessary for the production of certain vitamins, notably vitamin D (see also osteomalacia). Gloger\\'s rule is also vividly demonstrated among human populations. Populations that evolved in sunnier environments closer to the equator tend to be darker-pigmented than populations originating farther from the equator. There are exceptions, however; among the most well known are the Tibetans and Inuit, who have darker skin than might be expected from their native latitudes. In the first case, this is apparently an adaptation to the extremely high UV radiation on the Tibetan Plateau, whereas in the second case, the necessity to absorb UV radiation is alleviated by the Inuit\\'s diet, which is naturally rich in vitamin D. == See also == Allen\\'s rule Bergmann\\'s rule – correlating latitude with body mass in animals == References == == Further reading == Burtt, Edward H.

              " 'ABC Kids (originally titled Disney\\'s One Saturday Morning until 2002) was an American Saturday morning children\\'s programming block that aired on ABC from September 13, 1997 to August 27, 2011. It featured a mixture of animated and live-action series from Walt Disney Television Animation and Disney Channel, aimed at children between the ages of 6 and 12. This was the only time Disney Channel content aired on over-the-air television. The block regularly aired on Saturday mornings, though certain programs within the lineup aired on Sundays in some parts of the country due to station preferences for non-educational programming or scheduling issues with regional or network sports broadcasts. After five years of mainly repeats of programs introduced onto the block prior to the 2007–08 season, ABC decided it would cease to provide children\\'s programming during the Saturday morning timeslot, and entered into an agreement with Litton Entertainment to program that period; the block that resulted from this deal – Litton\\'s Weekend Adventure, which is structured as a syndication package distributed with virtual exclusivity to ABC\\'s owned-and-operated stations and affiliates – replaced ABC Kids on September 3, 2011. == History == === Disney\\'s One Saturday Morning === Immediately after The Walt Disney Company purchased ABC corporate parent Capital Cities/ABC Inc. in 1996, the network\\'s children\\'s program block ABC Saturday Morning, aired such Disney-produced series as The Mighty Ducks, Jungle Cubs and Gargoyles; it was one of two networks at the time that prominently carried Disney programming on Saturday mornings, as CBS also carried Disney cartoons (CBS\\' were mostly television spin-offs of Disney Renaissance films, whereas ABC\\'s were mostly other Disney properties). After Disney formally took over ABC\\'s operations, Disney head Michael Eisner sought to create a Saturday morning block that was different from those carried by its competitors at the time. In February 1997, Peter Hastings left Warner Bros. Animation and joined Disney, where he was tasked with overhauling ABC\\'s Saturday morning lineup in order to compete against Fox Kids and Kids\\' WB. He pitched an idea around the concept that Saturday is different from every other day of the week, and the representation of weekdays as buildings. Hastings also proposed the use of virtual set technology; although he knew a bit about it at the time and the technology used was just starting to be developed, Disney and ABC liked the idea. He hired Prudence Fenton as consultant manager and co-executive producer. Together, they sampled virtual set technology at the 1997 NAB Show and chose technology developed by Accom and ELSET. Rutherford Bench Productions, which had previously worked with Disney on other projects, hired Pacific Ocean Post (now POP Sound) to produce the virtual set. The building was initially a drawing of Grand Central Terminal with a roller coaster added but evolved into a towering mechanical structure. Even the interior has similarities such as a central high raised room, with two wings on the left and right sides and another on the south side.On September 13, 1997, Disney\\'s One Saturday Morning premiered as a two-hour sub-block within the ABC Saturday Morning lineup. It was originally scheduled to debut the Saturday prior on September 6, but coverage by all U.S. networks of the funeral of Princess Diana pushed back the premiere up one week to September 13. Disney’s One Saturday Morning featured two parts: three hours of regularly scheduled cartoons and a two-hour flagship show that included feature segments, comedy skits, and the virtual world which Hastings had proposed, along with newer episodes of three animated series: Doug (which had been acquired from Nickelodeon in 1996), Recess and Pepper Ann. Doug, Recess and Pepper Ann were each nominally given 40-minute time slots. The extended 10 minutes during each show\\'s slot were for One Saturday Morning\\'s interstitial segments and educational features. The live-action wraparound segments were originally hosted by Charlie (portrayed by Jessica Prunell) for the block\\'s first season in 1997, and later by MeMe (Valarie Rae Miller) beginning in September 1998; the segments also featured an elephant named Jelly Roll (voiced by stand up comedian and actor Brad Garrett), who served as a sidekick to the human host. Schoolhouse Rock!, a longtime essential of ABC\\'s Saturday morning block since 1973, also aired as an interstitial segment during The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show, the only non-Disney cartoon to carry into the block and one that would air until 2000, when the carriage contract with Warner Bros. was exhausted. Disney’s One Saturday Morning was initially a massive success, beating Fox Kids during its first season to be the most-watched Saturday morning block on broadcast television. It remained competitive in its second season, beating all of Fox Kids\\' shows except Power Rangers. The block received a new brand identity in the fall of 2000; this was followed by the shorts and hosted segments being discontinued on December 16 in a reformatting of the ABC block. By this time, the interstitials within the block were relegated to bumpers and program promotions. In the fall of 2001, live-action series were added to the One Saturday Morning lineup with the addition of the \"Zoog Hour,\" an hour-long sub-block featuring the Disney Channel original series Lizzie McGuire and Even Stevens (the sub-block, advertised in promos for Disney’s One Saturday Morning promoting the two programs as \"powered by Zoog,\" was named after Disney Channel\\'s weekend programming block at the time, Zoog Disney). A spin-off of Disney\\'s One Saturday Morning, Disney\\'s One Too, debuted on UPN on September 6, 1999; produced through a time-lease agreement between Disney and UPN, the block aired each weekday (either in the morning or afternoon, depending on the station\\'s preference) and on Sunday mornings, and featured many of the programs shown on One Saturday Morning (including Recess, Pepper Ann and Sabrina: The Animated Series). === ABC Kids === On July 23, 2001, the Walt Disney Company purchased Fox Family Worldwide, primarily for its Fox Family Channel, which was included in the sale as well as Saban Entertainment, a company in which Fox purchased a 50% interest in 1994. On September 14, 2002, ABC rebranded its Saturday morning block, as a subtle nod to the Fox Kids brand acquired by Disney through its purchase of Fox Family Worldwide, to ABC Kids (as a result of the sale, Fox Kids ceased to exist; Fox\\'s children\\'s program lineups would be handled from that point onward by 4Kids Entertainment until 2008).The rechristened block originally contained a mix of first-run programs exclusive to the block, as well as reruns of several original series from both Disney Channel and Toon Disney. NBA Inside Stuff also began airing on the block as a result of ABC\\'s acquisition of the broadcast television rights to the NBA from NBC (where the series originally premiered in 1992), beginning with the 2002–03 season\\'s Christmas Day game; Inside Stuff continued to air on ABC Kids until 2004. The new block abandoned the imagery of the One Saturday Morning era in favor of a sports motif, which remained throughout the ABC Kids era. Through Disney\\'s acquisition of Saban Entertainment, ABC also moved the Power Rangers series from Fox Kids to the ABC Kids block. All first-run episodes from the franchise premiered on ABC Kids beginning with the second half of the show\\'s Wild Force season (starting with the episode \"Unfinished Business\"), with the entirety of the Wild Force and Ninja Storm seasons subsequently airing in reruns on ABC Family (the former season aired in part both before the introduction of and during the ABC Family Action Block). However, when Toon Disney and ABC Family jointly launched the action-oriented Jetix block in 2004, Jetix handled all first-run episode debuts of subsequent seasons from Dino Thunder to Jungle Fury, while ABC Kids aired these seasons in reruns. Due to the merger between Jetix and Toon Disney to form Disney XD in 2009, the RPM season aired exclusively on ABC Kids, after which ABC canceled production of the series. Instead of producing a new season, ABC aired a re-version of the first 32 episodes of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, which included a new logo, an updated title sequence, comic book-referenced graphics, and extra alternative visual effects. The re-version aired from January 2 to August 28, 2010, after which Nickelodeon acquired rights to the franchise. In the 2004–05 season, ABC Kids dropped its two remaining original series, Fillmore! and Recess (the latter of which was airing in reruns on the block since it ended in 2001). With the expanded regulation of federally mandated educational programming guidelines defined by the Federal Communications Commission\\'s Children\\'s Television Act, and the debut of Good Morning America Weekend that fall (rival network NBC later noted that morning news shows caused a major viewership clash with cartoons, and ABC was the last of the Big Three networks to add a Saturday morning newscast), ABC chose to fulfill the three-hour quota by carrying select episodes of Disney Channel live-action comedies and animated series (anywhere between 9 and 13 episodes from a given season) featuring moral lessons and/or educational anecdotes. The episodes were selected by both the Standards and Practices Division of the network and any educational consultants who were attached to the shows. The Emperor\\'s New School, The Replacements and Hannah Montana were the last Disney Channel series to be added to the block in 2006. Beginning with the 2007–08 season, ABC Kids programming (with the exception of Power Rangers) was fully automated, putting the same handful of episodes of each show (The Emperor\\'s New School, The Replacements, That\\'s So Raven, Hannah Montana and The Suite Life of Zack & Cody) on a permanent rotation for the block\\'s remaining four years. === The closure of ABC Kids === In March 2010, ABC decided to stop providing a three-hour block of E/I-compliant, repurposed Disney Channel programming sent to its own stations and ABC affiliates. The network chose to lease out the three-hour time slot and seek other programmers for an agreement to produce a syndicated block, not for the network, but for each ABC station as the network was turning the E/I responsibility back to local ABC stations. In April 2010, ABC\\'s affiliate board announced that it had reached a deal with Litton Entertainment, a production company which produces syndicated programming (including educational programs aimed at children and teenagers), to produce six, all-new, original half-hour E/I series exclusively for ABC stations for the 2011–12 season.The block aired for the final time on August 27, 2011 without any announcement of its closure, and was quietly replaced by Litton\\'s Weekend Adventure the following week on September 3, 2011. As a result, ABC discontinued airing animated programming, making it the first network not to air animated series within its children\\'s program lineup since August 1992, when NBC discontinued its animation block on Saturday mornings to launch the live-action block TNBC. == Programming == Note: Every show that premiered before September 14, 2002 aired during the One Saturday Morning era. 1 Indicates that the program also ran on syndication or ABC prior to the block. 2 Indicates that the program moved to Toon Disney for its episode premieres. 3 Indicates that the program also aired under the Jetix brand. === Final programming === === Former programming === == See also == The Disney Afternoon – a Disney-produced syndicated children\\'s program block that ran from 1990 to 1997.

              " 'Loras Thomas Lane (October 19, 1910 – July 22, 1968), was an American prelate of the Roman Catholic Church. He served as an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Dubuque in Iowa from 1951 to 1956 and as bishop of the Diocese of Rockford in Illinois from 1956 until his death in 1968. == Biography == === Early life and ministry === Loras Lane was born on October 19, 1910, in Cascade, Iowa, to Thomas and Josephine (née Barrett) Lane. His nephew was Michael A. Hess, victim of a notorious adoption scandal detailed in the book The Lost Child of Philomena Lee.Lane attended St. Martin\\'s grade and high schools in Cascade. After graduating from the University of Notre Dame in 1932, he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Loras College in Dubuque, Iowa in 1933. He then attended the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, earning a Licentiate of Sacred Theology in 1937. === Priesthood === Lane was ordained to the priesthood for the Archdiocese of Dubuque by Cardinal Francesco Selvaggiani on March 19, 1937 in Rome.Upon his return to Iowa in 1937, Lane served as a curate at Nativity Parish in Dubuque until 1940. He studied at the University of Iowa before earning a Doctorate of Canon Law degree from The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. Lane became an instructor in Spanish and economics, and was appointed dean of men at Loras College. Lane became the secretary to Archbishop Henry Rohlman and vice-chancellor and then chancellor of the Archdiocese of Dubuque. In 1949, Pope Pius XII named Lane a domestic prelate. === Auxiliary Bishop of Dubuque === On May 29, 1951, Lane was appointed titular bishop of Bencenna and auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Dubuque by Pius XII.

Robertson, and at universities in Italy (beginning with support from a Fulbright Fellowship, 1978), especially the scholarly circle around Giuseppe Billanovich at the Catholic University of Milan. It was as a visiting scholar at Milan that he completed his study of the post-classical interpretations of Statius\\' epic poem Thebaid and their influence on Boccaccio and Chaucer, published as Before the Knight\\'s Tale (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1988), and identified in scattered manuscript sources a previously unrecognized commentary that was shown to be present in Boccaccio\\'s library and used by that author in his works: \"Boccaccio\\'s Glosses on Statius,\" Studi sul Boccaccio (1996). At the University of Pennsylvania (1980–1988), he was the first male member of the faculty to take an extended parenting leave. At the time, the request was unusual, and his act occasioned public discussion of gender bias in employment policies and was the subject of a front-page article in the Daily Pennsylvanian, \"Mr. Mom: Paternity Leave Allows English Prof to Raise Son\". In 1986 he curated an exhibition and catalogue of manuscripts and early printed books illustrating Chaucer\\'s works and their cultural influences, Sixty Books Old and New (New Chaucer Society, 1986). The exhibition was held at the University of Pennsylvania and the Rosenbach Foundation and was supported by several Philadelphia-area charitable organizations, which made possible the distribution of copies of the catalogue to English teachers in the Philadelphia public school district. Anderson\\'s other publications include Pound\\'s Cavalcanti (Princeton University Press, 1983), which remains \"invaluable\" to Ezra Pound scholars.He won the 1988-89 Rome Prize in Post-Classical Humanistic Studies.

              " 'Margaret Isobel Fulton (6 October 1924 – 24 July 2019) was a Scottish-born Australian food and cooking writer, journalist, author and commentator. She was the first of this genre of writers in Australia.Fulton\\'s early recipes encouraged Australians to alter their traditional staple of \"meat and three vegetables\" and to be creative with food. She encouraged international cuisine from places such as Spain, Italy, India and China. As the cookery editor of the Woman\\'s Day magazine, she \"brought these into Australian homes through her articles.\"Although she did some television work, Fulton mainly concentrated on writing, because she felt it was her higher talent. == Early life and career == Fulton was born in Nairn in the Scottish Highlands on 6 October 1924. When she was three, her parents emigrated to Australia, settling in Glen Innes, New South Wales. She was a Girl Guide as a child and leader of the Magpie Patrol in Glen Innes. In her time as a Guide she learned to cook over a campfire.She began as a cooking teacher at the Overseas Corporation in 1947 and was later promoted to sales manager. She was \"partially responsible for the introduction of the pressure cooker to Australia\".In 1954, Fulton, then a \"home economist for a leading firm of cereal manufacturers\", gave a talk on \"cooking with ready-to-eat cereals\". She told the audience that \"with more wives and mothers working, speed and ease in food preparation is a \\'must\\'\". She continued, \"Many women have no training in homemaking, and packaged and ready-prepared foods, like cereals, cake, pastry and biscuit mixes, canned and frozen foods, make life easier\". A selection of \"hot muffins made with bran\" were handed out, and Fulton told the listeners that \"These are quick and easy to make and most economical\".In 1956, over four days, Fulton provided French cooking demonstrations. Each day was organised with a different \"well-known French hostess, resident in Sydney\" who \"planned a menu, contributed the recipes, helped with the cooking, and arranged the table setting\".Fulton began to appear in advertisements in the late 1950s. She promoted Johnson\\'s Glo-coat floor polish and Johnson\\'s Pride surface polish from her \"well appointed Sydney kitchen\" in March 1957. Later that year readers of The Australian Women\\'s Weekly were told \"Margaret Fulton, expert Home Economist\" believed Sellotape \"is so dependable\" in a full-page colour advertisement, which also offered Fulton\\'s handy hints for using the product such as sealing plastic bags \"for deep-freezing foods\" and binding pot handles. In 1959, Fulton told readers she used Sellotape \"each week for sticking my hundreds of recipe clippings into reference books\".Prospective buyers of Woman\\'s Day magazine in July 1964 were promised an \"8-page liftout\" from Fulton, who was known for her Tuesday cookery class at Sydney\\'s Bistro. Her regular contributions continued throughout the decade with 1968\\'s lift-out full-colour recipe guide to Italian food, which was described by the magazine as \"our most exciting ... ever!\". == 1960s and 1970s == The Margaret Fulton Cookbook was published by Paul Hamlyn in 1968 and was an instant success. By 1978 it had sold \"more than two-thirds of a million copies\". She returned to the Italian theme with the publication of her Italian Cookbook in 1973. The Canberra Times said the recipes were \"simple, tested ... and where necessary adapted to suit the local scene\"; however, Fulton was \"able to add authenticity to the book by taking a trip to Italy and checking the fare at first hand\". The author was quoted as recommending that cooks \"look for the specialty ingredients in a good delicatessen or gourmet section of a large retail stores. Use only the best quality Italian olive oil and when using grating cheese like Parmesan or Romano, buy it in wedges and grate it as you need it.\"In October 1973, Fulton was appointed to the federal government\\'s Interim Commission on Consumer Standards, which was formed to \"reach as many groups as possible\" and \"find the areas where action\" on standards was \"most urgent\".Interviewed in 1975, Fulton provided Italian and Chinese-style recipes for readers. She included in her advice for \"young people setting up home for the first time\" that they should \"buy a couple of really good saucepans and, if possible, invest in an iron oven casserole ... they last a lifetime and these days are so attractive that they can be taken to the table\".Following on from the popularity of late 1970s BBC television drama series The Duchess of Duke Street, set in London between 1900 and 1925, Fulton had a primetime television cooking show of 5-minute episodes based on recipes from the era.In 1979, her interest in Chinese cuisine led to her leading a planned 23-day gourmet food tour, which would include \"the finest restaurants\" of Canton, Shanghai, Tsinan, Tsingtao, Kunming and Peking. Fulton said the tour would also visit \"historical sites... communes, universities, factories and handcraft institutes\". She also hoped there would be \"a chance to see acupuncture procedures in a Chinese hospital\". == Later life and influence == Fulton was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia in the 1983 Queen\\'s Birthday Honours \"In recognition of service to the media as a journalist and writer in the field of cookery\".Fulton\\'s encouragement of Chinese cuisine was recognised as a contributor to the development of Sydney\\'s Chinatown, where \"few non-Chinese\" had ventured \"before the 1950s\". Fulton was one of the writers who \"began serving up Chinese recipes to Menzies\\' Australia\" (recalling the era of Robert Menzies as prime minister from 1949 to 1966) and, as a result, Chinatown\\'s \"few eating houses were seen as a welcome alternative to the spartan cuisine of the times\".In 1998, Fulton was added to the list of 100 Australian Living Treasures by the National Trust of Australia. The same year, a packaged meals business venture \\'Margaret Fulton\\'s kitchen\\' failed. Fulton had been involved in it with \\'Sydney food luminary\\' Anders Ousback.In 2006, The Bulletin named Fulton in their list of \"The 100 most influential Australians\". In the citation they described her as someone who \"changed the way Australians ate at home\". She is, they wrote, \"Australia\\'s original domestic goddess. No cookery writer since can claim her blanket influence ... Fulton turned us into foodies.\"Interviewed by The Australian Women\\'s Weekly in 2009, Fulton said: Scarcely a week passes when I\\'m not invited to speak at a food industry or fundraising function and I always try to accept. At my age, being asked to pass on what I\\'ve learned is a pleasure and a privilege. In 2014 Fulton appeared on an Australian postage stamp as part of the \\'Australia Post Legends Awards\\'. Chef Neil Perry, Kylie Kwong, Stephanie Alexander and Maggie Beer also featured in the same stamp series.Fulton died on 24 July 2019 at the age of 94. No cause was given. On 30 July, the NSW Premier announced that Fulton\\'s family had been offered a State memorial service for Fulton, which the family accepted. == Family == Fulton had one daughter, Suzanne Gibbs, and two granddaughters, Kate Gibbs and Louise Keats, all of whom pursued careers in food. Kate Gibbs wrote two cookbooks and wrote a third book about Margaret\\'s life, titled \"Margaret and Me\".Louise Keats explored Fulton\\'s impact on her own childhood in her illustrated children\\'s storybook \"My Grandma\\'s Kitchen\". Fulton supported Keats\\' food career including by sending her to the Le Cordon Bleu school of cookery. Keats later studied nutrition at Deakin University and authored five more cookbooks, crediting Fulton for inspiring her passion for food and cooking. == Honours and awards == 1983 – Medal of the Order of Australia 1986 – \\'diploma of honour\\' from Comité Interprofessionnel du vin de Champagne == Bibliography == Fulton wrote many books, including: The Margaret Fulton Cookbook (various editions) Encyclopaedia of Food and Cookery == References == == External links == Official website Margaret Fulton at IMDb Australian Biography Online 1 May 2007, ABC call for \"Favourite Margaret Fulton Memory\"',\n",
              " 'Peter Phillips (born 15 October 1953) is a British choral conductor and musicologist. He was the founder of The Tallis Scholars in 1973 and of Gimell Records (with Steve Smith) in 1980. == Early life and education == Phillips was born in Southampton and educated at Winchester College (1967–71) and St John\\'s College, Oxford (Organ Scholar 1972–75). He studied music with Hugh Macdonald, Denis Arnold and David Wulstan. He subsequently taught at Oxford University, Trinity College of Music and the Royal College of Music in London (where he directed the Chamber Choir in succession to David Willcocks), but had resigned all these posts by 1988 in order to pursue a full-time career in conducting. == The Tallis Scholars == Phillips\\'s first concert with the Tallis Scholars took place in St Mary Magdalen\\'s Church, Oxford on 3 November 1973. The group was made up of choral scholars (hence the use of the word \\'Scholars\\' in the title) and layclerks from the leading Oxbridge choral foundations. From the start Phillips aimed to produce a distinctive sound, influenced by choirs he admired, in particular the Clerkes of Oxenford. However the repertoire he chose was idiosyncratic, based in his desire to explore neglected corners of the polyphonic repertories, continental as much as English. This first concert included music by Obrecht, Ockeghem and Lassus. After the foundation of Gimell Records in 1980, the Tallis Scholars have gone on to fill many gaps in the recording catalogue, making discs devoted to such relatively unknown composers as Obrecht, Ockeghem, Cardoso, White, Clemens, Gombert and Mouton. Since winning the Gramophone Record of the Year Award in 1987, the Tallis Scholars have been recognised as perhaps the world\\'s leading ensemble in interpreting renaissance polyphony. That 1987 disc inaugurated a career-long project of recording all of Josquin des Prez’s masses, ready for the 500th anniversary of the composer’s death, in 2021. The ninth and last disc in the series also won an Award entitled Record of the Year – from the BBC Music Magazine – in 2021, 34 years after the first one. Phillips first met the composer John Tavener in 1977, which led to a lifelong friendship. For many years Tavener was the only living composer to write for The Tallis Scholars, a connection which resulted in such masterpieces as the Ikon of Light, the Lords Prayer (1999), Let not the Prince be silent, Tribute to Cavafy and The Requiem Fragments. In more recent years Phillips has commissioned Eric Whitacre, Gabriel Jackson, Nico Muhly, Ivan Moody, John Woolrich, Matthew Martin, Christopher Willcock, Michael Nyman; and in 2014 made a disc entirely dedicated to Arvo Pärt\\'s tintinnabuli style. Phillips gave his first Promenade concert in 1988, since when he has appeared eight more times, always with the Tallis Scholars, though in 2007 also with the BBC Singers, when the two groups joined forces to give the first modern performance of Striggio\\'s 60-part Mass Ecco si beato giorno. Phillips and The Tallis Scholars appeared at the Proms on 4 August 2014 to help mark the exact anniversary of the outbreak of World War 1, with a Requiem written for them by John Tavener, televised on BBC 4. In 2018 they returned to the Albert Hall to sing a specially adapted Compline service. In 1990 Phillips was the subject of a South Bank Show, introduced by Melvyn Bragg. It followed the course of renaissance polyphony through England and the Netherlands and was entitled \"A Personal Odyssey\". In 2013 he directed the Tallis Scholars in a 99-concert year of events, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the group. Amongst other countries they visited New Zealand for the first time, Australia for the seventh time, Japan for the 14th time, and the US for the 61st. == Other conducting work == In 1985 Phillips was invited to conduct the Chapelle Royale of Paris (by Philippe Herreweghe), and the Netherlands Chamber Choir, which sparked a lifelong interest in working with groups trained outside the Anglican choral tradition. These invitations also promoted in Phillips an interest in European culture, cuisines and languages. He has owned property in Paris since 1989 and given interviews in French, German, Italian and Spanish. He is also a student of Arabic (in which he has not given an interview). As of 2021, The Tallis Scholars have given more than two-thirds of their 2500 concerts outside the UK. Phillips started a collaboration with the BBC Singers in 2003, with whom he has now appeared in nearly 25 productions, most recently in May 2021 in a live broadcast from Maida Vale, featuring Mexican polyphony written for Puebla Cathedral. He also currently has projects in preparation with Intrada (Moscow), The Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir (Tallinn), El Leon de Oro (Oviedo), The Nederlands Chamber Choir and The Taipei Chamber Singers. == Educational work == In 2000 Peter Phillips and David Woodcock set up the first Tallis Scholars Summer School in Oakham. This was followed in 2005 by an extension in Seattle (US), and in 2007 by one in Sydney (Australia). He has also been involved with similar courses in Rimini, Evora and Barcelona. He lectured on the John Hall pre-University course in Venice from 1981 to 2019. Phillips began an association with Merton College Chapel in 1974 when, as an undergraduate, he directed Tallis\\'s \\'Why fum\\'th in fight\\' as a prelude to a performance of Vaughan Williams\\'s Fantasia on a Theme of Thomas Tallis. The Tallis Scholars recorded regularly in Merton Chapel between 1976 and 1987, returning more permanently in 2005. In 2006, with the help of Jessica Rawson and Simon Jones, Phillips established a new choral foundation at the College. This choir sang its first services under Phillips and Benjamin Nicholas in October 2008. In 2014 Phillips helped to establish the first of three London International Choral Competitions at St John\\'s Smith Square. Among the judges were John Rutter, Emma Kirkby, Alastair Hume, Mark Williams and James O\\'Donnell. Featured composers have been John Tavener, Gabriel Jackson and Arvo Pärt. Phillips has recently become a founding trustee of the Muze Trust, a charity designed to help with musical education in Zambia. At the invitation of Paul Kelly he visited Lusaka in 2010, directing Vox Zambesi in a concert and a recording, and continuing as a Trustee to the present. == Publications == Phillips wrote a regular column for the Spectator magazine on all aspects of classical music from January 1983 to April 2016, a span of exactly a third of a century. In 1989 he also wrote a cricket column. In 1995 he became the owner and publisher of the Musical Times – the oldest continuously published music journal in the world. He has also written for the Times Literary Supplement, the Times, the Guardian, the Musical Times, the Royal Academy Magazine, the BBC Music Magazine and the Evening Standard. He has written three books: English Sacred Music 1549–1649 (Gimell, 1991); What We Really Do (Musical Times, 2nd edition, 2013); and, during the pandemic of 2020/21, a novel entitled The Blue French, about a performance of Tallis’s Spem in alium (yet to be published). == Other activities == Phillips is a keen follower of cricket and a member of the Marylebone Cricket Club. He is also a member of the Chelsea Arts Club. In 1986 he became a qualified pilot, in the hope of taming his fear of turbulence. == Awards and honours == In 2005, Peter Phillips was made a Chevalier de l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Minister of Culture, a decoration intended to honour individuals who have contributed to the understanding of French culture in the world, in his case Josquin des Prez. From 2008 to 2016 he was made a Reed Rubin Director of Music at Merton College, Oxford, and in 2010 a Bodley Fellow. In 2021 he was elected an Honorary Fellow of St John’s College, Oxford, where he had been Organ Scholar from 1972 to 1975. With the Tallis Scholars he has received four Gramophone Awards (in 1987, 1991, 1994 and 2005); two Diapason d’Or de l’Année (in 1989 and 2012); three Grammy nominations (in 2002, 2009 and 2010); and Record of the Year from the BBC Music Magazine in 2021. His 1980 recording of Allegri\\'s Miserere was said by the BBC Music Magazine to be one of the 50 greatest recordings of all time.In 2009 the Tallis Scholars were voted by Early Music Today the fourth most influential early group in the history of the genre, after the instrumental ensembles of David Munrow, John Eliot Gardiner and Christopher Hogwood. In 2013 they were voted into the Gramophone\\'s Hall of Fame – about 120 names from the entire history of classical recording – the only early music group to be so listed. == References == English Sacred Music 1549–1649 (Gimell, 1991) What We Really Do (Musical Times: 1st edition 2003) What We Really Do (Musical Times: 2nd edition 2013) Gramophone Magazine (September 1994): Cover Feature Early Music Today (October/ November 2009 pg. 15)',\n",

              " 'Hotan (also known as Gosthana, Gaustana, Godana, Godaniya, Khotan, Hetian, Hotien) is a major oasis town in southwestern Xinjiang, an autonomous region in Western China. The city proper of Hotan broke off from the larger Hotan County to become an administrative area in its own right in August 1984. It is the seat of Hotan Prefecture. With a population of 408,900 (2018 census), Hotan is situated in the Tarim Basin some 1,500 kilometres (930 mi) southwest of the regional capital, Ürümqi. It lies just north of the Kunlun Mountains, which are crossed by the Sanju, Hindutash and Ilchi passes. The town, located southeast of Yarkant County and populated almost exclusively by Uyghurs, is a minor agricultural center. An important station on the southern branch of the historic Silk Road, Hotan has always depended on two strong rivers—the Karakash River and the White Jade River to provide the water needed to survive on the southwestern edge of the vast Taklamakan Desert. The White Jade River still provides water and irrigation for the town and oasis. == Etymology == The original name of Hotan is Godana, Gosthana/Gausthana/Gaustana or Godaniya, the name used in Sanskrit cosmological texts and also how the area is historically referred to as.Gosthana/Gausthana/Gaustana/Godana/Godaniya translates to \"land of cows\" in Sanskrit. In Chinese, the same name is written as Yu-t\\'ien, pronounced as Gu-dana. The pronunciation changed over the years to Kho-tan. In the 7th century, Xuanzang tried to reverse interpret it in Sanskrit as Kustana. However, the Tibetans continue to call it Gosthana, which also carries the meaning of \"land of cows\".An alternative etymology is proposed by Bailey, referring to the oldest indigenous form Hvatana, with hva- meaning \"own, owned\", whence \"Lord\" as in MP. \"khwa-day\". == History == The oasis of Hotan is strategically located at the junction of the southern (and most ancient) branch of the Silk Road joining China and the West with one of the main routes from ancient India and Tibet to Central Asia and distant China. It provided a convenient meeting place where not only goods, but technologies, philosophies, and religions were transmitted from one culture to another. Tocharians lived in this region over 2000 years ago. Several of the Tarim mummies were found in the region. At Sampul, east of the city of Hotan, there is an extensive series of cemeteries scattered over an area about 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) wide and 23 km (14 mi) long. The excavated sites range from about 300 BCE to 100 CE. The excavated graves have produced a number of fabrics of felt, wool, silk and cotton and even a fine bit of tapestry, the Sampul tapestry, showing the face of Caucasoid man which was made of threads of 24 shades of color. The tapestry had been cut up and fashioned into trousers worn by one of the deceased. An Anthropological study of 56 individuals showed a primarily Caucasoid population. A study in 2010 showed that an Eastern Eurasian lineage common in Siberia dominates the mitochondrial DNA of the mummies from the Xiaohe Cemetery. Their Y chromosome is distributed throughout Eastern Europe, South Asia, Central Asia, and Siberia.There is a relative abundance of information on Hotan readily available for study. The main historical sources are to be found in the Chinese histories (particularly detailed during the Han and early Tang dynasties) when China was interested in control of the Western Regions, the accounts of several Chinese pilgrim monks, a few Buddhist histories of Hotan that have survived in Classical Tibetan and a large number of documents in the Iranian Saka language and other languages discovered, for the most part, early this century at various sites in the Tarim Basin and from the hidden library at the Mogao Caves near Dunhuang. === Buddhist Khotan === The ancient Kingdom of Khotan was one of the earliest Buddhist states in the world and a cultural bridge across which Buddhist culture and learning were transmitted from India to China. Its capital was located to the west of the modern city of Hotan. The inhabitants of the Kingdom of Khotan, like those of early Kashgar and Yarkant, spoke Saka, one of the Eastern Iranian languages. Khotan\\'s indigenous dynasty (all of whose royal names are Indian in origin) governed a fervently Buddhist city-state boasting some 400 temples in the late 9th/early 10th century—four times the number recorded by Xuanzang around 630. The kingdom was independent but was intermittently under Chinese control during the Han and Tang Dynasty. After the Tang dynasty, Khotan formed an alliance with the rulers of Dunhuang. Khotan enjoyed close relations with the Buddhist centre at Dunhuang: the Khotanese royal family intermarried with Dunhuang élites, visited and patronized Dunhuang\\'s Buddhist temple complex, and donated money to have their portraits painted on the walls of the Mogao grottos. Through the 10th century, Khotanese royal portraits were painted in association with an increasing number of deities in the caves. Besides this, a particular site, Melikawat functioned as a major Buddhist center in the Kingdom of Khotan. In the 10th century, Khotan began a struggle with the Kara-Khanid Khanate, a Turkic state. The Kara-Khanid ruler, Sultan Satuq Bughra Khan, had converted to Islam: Satuq\\'s son, Musa, began to put pressure on Khotan in the mid-10th century, and sometime before 1006 Yusuf Qadir Khan of Kashgar besieged and took the city. This conquest of Buddhist Khotan by the Muslim Turks—about which there are many colourful legends—marked another watershed in the Islamicisation and Turkicisation of the Tarim Basin, and an end to local autonomy of this southern Tarim city state. Some Khotanese Buddhist works were unearthed.The rulers of Khotan were aware of the menace they faced since they arranged for the Mogao grottoes to paint a growing number of divine figures along with themselves. Halfway in the 10th century Khotan came under attack by the Qarakhanid ruler Musa, and in what proved to be a pivotal moment in the Turkification and Islamification of the Tarim Basin, the Karakhanid leader Yusuf Qadir Khan conquered Khotan around 1006. === Islamic Khotan === Yūsuf Qadr Khān was a brother or cousin of the Muslim ruler of Kashgar and Balasagun, Khotan lost its independence and between 1006 and 1165, became part of the Kara-Khanid Khanate. Later it fell to the Kara-Khitan Khanate, after which it was ruled by the Mongols. When Marco Polo visited Khotan in the 13th century, he noted that the people were all Muslim. He wrote that: Khotan was \"a province eight days’ journey in extent, which is subject to the Great Khan. The inhabitants all worship Mahomet. It has cities and towns in plenty, of which the most splendid, and the capital of the province, bears the same name as that of the province…It is amply stocked with the means of life. Cotton grows here in plenty. It has vineyards, estates and orchards in plenty. The people live by trade and industry; they are not at all warlike\". === 19th century === The town suffered severely during the Dungan Revolt (1862–77) against the Qing dynasty and again a few years later when Yaqub Beg of Kashgar made himself master of Kashgaria, ruling the newly founded Turkic state known at the time as Yettishar. === Post-Qing === Qing imperial authority collapsed in 1912. During the Republican era in China, warlords and local ethnic self-determination movements wrestled over control of Xinjiang. Abdullah Bughra, Nur Ahmad Jan Bughra, and Muhammad Amin Bughra declared themselves Emirs of Khotan during the Kumul Rebellion. Tunganistan was an independent administered region in the southern part of Xinjiang from 1934 to 1937. The territory included the oases of the southern Tarim Basin; the centre of the region was Khotan. Beginning with the Islamic rebellion in 1937, Hotan and the rest of the province came under the control of warlord Sheng Shicai. Sheng was later ousted by the Kuomintang. === People\\'s Republic of China === Shortly after the Communists won the civil war in 1949, Hotan was incorporated into the People\\'s Republic of China. In 1983/4, the urban area of Hotan was administratively split from the larger Hotan County, and from then on governed as a county-level city.On July 11, 2006, the townships of Jiya and Yurungqash (Yulongkashi) in Lop County and Tusalla (Tushala) in Hotan County were transferred to Hotan City.Following the July 2009 Ürümqi riots, ethnic tensions rose in Xinjiang and in Hotan in particular. As a result, the city has seen occasional bouts of violence. In June 2011, Hotan opened its first passenger-train service to Kashgar, which was established as a special economic zone following the riots. In July of the same year, a bomb and knife attack occurred on the city\\'s central thoroughfare. In June 2011, authorities in Hotan Prefecture sentenced Uyghur Muslim Hebibullah Ibrahim to ten years imprisonment for selling \"illegal religious materials\". In June 2012, Tianjin Airlines Flight 7554 was hijacked en route from Hotan to Ürümqi. In a report from the Uyghur American Association, in June 2012, notice was said to be given that police planned to undertake a search of every residence in Gujanbagh (Gujiangbage), Hotan. Hotan is the last municipality in Xinjiang with a majority Ugyhur presence in the core of the city. The UAA viewed this as an attempt to systematically intimidate the Uyghur population in Hotan.The Sultanim Cemetery (37°07′02″N 79°56′04″E) in central Hotan was a historical Uyghur graveyard that also included a religious shrine. According to a 2019 interview by the Uyghur Human Rights Project, the cemetery entombed four commanders of Sultan Satuq Bughra Khan, who conquered the city around 960 CE and spread Islam. Due to space limitations after over a thousand years of burials, multiple bodies had to reuse the same grave, and additionals layers were dug underneath old ones. Between 2018 and 2019, the cemetery was demolished and the western part of the land turned into a parking lot. == Geography and climate == Hotan has a temperate zone, cold desert climate (Köppen BWk), with a mean annual total of only 36.5 millimetres (1.44 in) of precipitation falling on 17.3 days of the year. Due to its southerly location in Xinjiang just north of the Kunlun Mountains, during winter it is one of the warmest locations in the region, with average high temperatures remaining above freezing throughout the year. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from −3.9 °C (25.0 °F) in January to 25.8 °C (78.4 °F) in July, and the annual mean is 13.03 °C (55.5 °F). The diurnal temperature variation is not large for a desert, averaging 11.8 °C (21.2 °F) annually. Although no month averages less than half of possible sunshine, the city only receives 2,587 hours of bright sunshine annually, which is on the low end for Xinjiang; monthly percent possible sunshine ranges from 50% in March to 75% in October. == Administrative divisions == The city includes four subdistricts, three towns, five townships and two other areas:Subdistricts: Nurbag Subdistrict (Nu\\'erbage; 努尔巴格街道/奴尔巴格街道), Gujanbagh Subdistrict (Gujiangbage; 古江巴格街道), Gulbagh Subdistrict (Gulebage; 古勒巴格街道), Na\\'erbage Subdistrict (纳尔巴格街道)Towns: Laskuy (Lasikui, Lasqi; لاسكۇي بازىرى / 拉斯奎镇), Yurungqash (Yulongkashi; يۇرۇڭقاش بازىرى / 玉龙喀什镇), Tusalla (Tushala; تۇساللا بازىرى, formerly تۇساللا يېزىسى / 吐沙拉镇, formerly 吐沙拉鄉)Townships: Shorbagh Township (Xiao\\'erbage; شورباغ يېزىسى / 肖尔巴格乡), Ilchi Township (Yiliqi; ئىلچى يېزىسى / 伊里其乡), Gujanbagh Township (Gujiangbage; گۇجانباغ يېزىسى / 古江巴格乡), Jiya Township (جىيا يېزىسى / 吉亚乡), Aqchal Township (Akeqiale ئاقچال يېزىسى / 阿克恰勒乡)Others: Beijing Industrial Park (北京工业园区), Hotan City Jinghe Logistics Park (和田市京和物流园区) == Demographics == Hotan is largely dominated by the Uyghurs, and as of 2015, 311,050 of the 348,289 residents of the county were Uyghur, 35,897 were Han Chinese and 1,342 were from other ethnic groups.In 1940, Owen Lattimore quoted the population of Khotan to be estimated as 26,000.In 1998 the urban population was recorded at 154,352, 83% of which were Uyghurs, and 17% were Han Chinese.In 1999, 83.01% of the population was Uyghur and 16.57% of the population was Han Chinese.In the 2000 census, the population was recorded as 186,123. In the 2010 census figure, the figure had risen to 322,300. The increase in population is partly due to boundary changes. == Transportation == === Air === Hotan Airport (IATA: HTN) serves the city. It serves regional flights to Ürümqi. Originally a military use airport, it was expanded significantly in 2002 to accommodate higher passenger volumes. It is located 12 km (7.5 mi) south of the city proper. === Road === Hotan is served by China National Highway 315, which runs along the southern Tarim Basin from Ruoqiang to Kashgar, and the Trans-Taklamakan Desert Highway, which run north to Luntai. An expressway is being built between Hotan and Karakax County (Moyu) as of 2014. === Rail === Hotan is connected to the rest of China\\'s rail network via the Kashgar–Hotan Railway, which opened to freight traffic in December 2010, and passenger service in June 2011. The railway station was constructed by a company under the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, and is located in the town of Lasqi (拉斯奎) northwest of the city proper. Passenger train service on this line is limited, with only one train per day, local service 5828/5825, linking the city with Kashgar (8~ hours) and Ürümqi (~34 hours). === Buses === Regular bus services link Hotan with Kashgar. There is also an express bus to Aksu via the 430 km (270 mi) \\'Hotan-Aksu Cross-Desert Highway\\' which was opened in 2007, travels alongside the intermittent Hotan River, and which takes about 5 or 6 hours. This same bus then goes on to Urumchi taking a total of about 21 hours from Hotan. == Economy == As of 1885, there was about 100,000 acres (662,334 mu) of cultivated land in Khotan. === Nephrite jade === Chinese historical sources indicate that Hotan was the main source of the nephrite jade used in ancient China. For several hundred years, until they were defeated by the Xiongnu in 176 BCE, the trade of Khotanese jade into China was controlled by the nomadic Yuezhi. The Chinese still refer to the Yurungkash as the White Jade River, alluding to the white jade recovered from its alluvial deposits. The light-colored jade is called \"Mutton fat\" jade. Most of the jade is now gone, with only a few kilos of good quality jade found yearly. Some is still mined in the Kunlun Mountains to the south in the summer, but it is generally of poorer quality than that found in the rivers. === Fabrics and carpets === Khotanese textiles were mentioned by Xuanzang, who visited the oasis in 644 CE. In his Biography it is stated: \"It produced carpets and fine felt, and the felt-makers also spun coarse and fine silk.\" Ancient Chinese-Khotanese relations were so close that the oasis emerged as one of the earliest centres of silk manufacture outside China. There are good reasons to believe that the silk-producing industry flourished in Hotan as early as the 5th century. According to one story, a Chinese princess given in marriage to a Khotan prince brought to the oasis the secret of silk-manufacture, \"hiding silkworms in her hair as part of her dowry\", probably in the first half of the 1st century CE. It was from Khotan that the eggs of silkworms were smuggled to Iran, reaching Justinian I\\'s Constantinople in 551.Silk production is still a major industry employing more than a thousand workers and producing some 150 million metres of silk annually. Silk weaving by Uyghur women is a thriving cottage industry, some of it produced using traditional methods. Hotan Silk Factory is one of the notable silk producers in Hotan. Atlas is the fabric used for traditional Uyghur clothing worn by Uyghur women. It is soft, light and graceful tie-dyed silk fabric. It comes various colors, the brighter and rich colors are for small children to young ladies. The gray and dark colors are for elderly women. The oldest piece of kilim which we have any knowledge was obtained by the archaeological explorer Aurel Stein; a fragment from an ancient settlement near Hotan, which was buried by sand drifts about the fourth century CE. The weave is almost identical with that of modern kilims. Hotanese pile carpets are still highly prized and form an important export. == Notable persons == Islam Akhun Muhammad Amin Bughra Nur Ahmadjan Bughra Abdullah Bughra == Gallery == == See also == Atlas silk Dandan Oilik Hotan Cultural Museum Khatana Kingdom of Khotan Silk Road transmission of Buddhism == Notes == == References == === Citations === === Sources === == External links == Official government site (in Chinese) Silk Road Seattle - University of Washington (The Silk Road Seattle website contains many useful resources including a number of full-text historical works) Site devoted to the Buddhism of Khotan with a copy of Sir Aurel Stein\\'s map of the Tarim Basin and Khotan region Satellite image of region which can be enlarged China: Taklamakan - Desert With No Ocean Underground Bealby, John Thomas (1911). \"Khotan\" .

              " 'Audovera (d. 580) was the first wife or mistress of Chilperic I, king of Neustria. They had five children. Theudebert, killed in battle in 575 by Guntram Boso during the interminable conflict between Chilperic and his brothers. Merovech, married the widow Brunhilda, becoming his father\\'s enemy. Killed by his servants on his own orders in 578. Clovis, assassinated by Fredegund in 580. Childesinda, mentioned but once in the Liber Historiae Francorum as the infant whose botched baptism led to Audovera\\'s dismissal. Committed to the same nunnery as her mother. Basina, nun, banished to a convent in 580. She later led a revolt in the abbey of Poitiers in 589.Some time before 567, Audovera and Fredegund prepared for the baptism of Childesinda while Chilperic was away. Fredegund learnt that it was forbidden for a mother to receive her own child in her arms following a baptism, due to a canon law forbidding marriage between parents and godparents. Fredegund arranged the events of the baptism such that Audovera unknowingly broke this taboo. On Chilperic\\'s return, Fredegund informed him of what Audovera had done. Chilperic committed Audovera to a convent in a rage. Fredegund later had her murdered in 580 to coincide with the assassination of Clovis and the exile of Basina. == References == \" A Popular History of France Vol 1, chapter VIII, the Merovingians\" from Humanitiesweb, last accessed July 22, 2007',\n",
              " 'This article outlines the present structure of the European Union\\'s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), a part of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) based on articles 42–46 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). Article 42.2 of TEU states that the CSDP includes the \\'progressive framing\\' of a common Union defence policy, and will lead to a common defence, when the European Council of national heads of state or government, acting unanimously, so decides. The CSDP involves military or civilian missions being deployed to preserve peace, prevent conflict and strengthen international security in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter. Military missions are carried out by EU forces established with contributions from the member states\\' armed forces. The CSDP also entails collective self-defence amongst member states as well as a Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) in which 25 of the 28 national armed forces pursue structural integration. The CSDP structure, headed by the Union\\'s High Representative (HR/VP), Josep Borrell Fontelles, comprises: the Defence Industry Directorate-General of the European Commission relevant sections of the External Action Service (EEAS) — including the Military Staff (EUMS) with its so-called Military Planning and Conduct Capability (MPCC) a number of Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) preparatory bodies — such as the Military Committee (EUMC) four agencies, including the Defence Agency (EDA)The EU does not have a permanent military command structure along the lines of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\\'s (NATO) Allied Command Operations (ACO), although it has been agreed that ACO resources may be used for the conduct of the EU\\'s CSDP missions. The MPCC, established in 2017 and to be strengthened in 2020, does however represent the EU\\'s first step in developing a permanent military headquarters. In parallel, the newly established European Defence Fund (EDF) marks the first time the EU budget is used to finance multinational defence projects. The CSDP structure is sometimes referred to as the European Defence Union (EDU), especially in relation to its prospective development as the EU\\'s defence arm.Decisions relating to the CSDP are proposed by the HR/VP, adopted by the FAC, generally requiring unanimity, and then implemented by the HR/VP. == Deployment procedure == Military operations may be launched after four planning phases, through which the Operation Commander (Op. Cdr.), Military Staff (EUMS), Military Committee (EUMC), Political and Security Committee (PSC) and Council have different roles: I: Political Framework for Crisis Approach (PFCA) II: Crisis Management Concept (CMC) III: Military Strategic Options (MSO, unless within CMC) and Initiating Military Directive (IMD) IV: Concept of Operations (CONOPS), Operations Plan (OPLAN) and Rules of Engagement (ROE) == Overview == All military or civilian missions of the European Union (EU), as part of its Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), are planned and conducted by an operation headquarters (OHQ). All civilian missions are directed by the Civilian Planning and Conduct Capability (CPCC), a directorate of the External Action Service (EEAS) in Brussels, Belgium. For each military mission an OHQ is chosen. The EU does not have a permanent military command structure along the lines of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\\'s (NATO) Allied Command Operations (ACO), although it has been agreed that ACO resources may be used for the conduct of the EU\\'s CSDP missions. The Military Planning and Conduct Capability (MPCC), established in 2017 and to be strengthened in 2020, does however represent the EU\\'s first step in developing a permanent operational headquarters (OHQ). The EU command and control (C2) structure is directed by political bodies composed of member states\\' representatives, and generally requires unanimous decisions. As of April 2019: Liaison: Advice and recommendations Support and monitoring Preparatory work 1 In the event of a CSDP Civilian Mission also being in the field, the relations with the Civilian Planning and Conduct Capability (CPCC) and its Civilian Operation Commander (Civ OpCdr), as well as the subordinate Head of Mission (HoM), are coordinated as shown.2 Other Component Commanders (CCs) and service branches which may be established.3 The MPCC is part of the EUMS and Dir MPCC is double-hatted as DGEUMS. Unless the MPCC is used as Operation Headquarters (OHQ), either a national OHQ offered by member states or the NATO Command Structure (NCS) would serve this purpose. In the latter instance, Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe (DSACEUR), rather than Dir MPCC, would serve as Operation Commander (OpCdr).4 Unless the MPCC is used as Operation Headquarters (OHQ), the MFCdr would be known as a Force Commander (FCdr), and direct a Force Headquarters (FHQ) rather than a MFHQ. Whereas the MFHQ would act both on the operational and tactical level, the FHQ would act purely on the operational level.5 The political strategic level is not part of the C2 structure per se, but represents the political bodies, with associated support facilities, that determine the missions\\' general direction. The Council determines the role of the High Representative (HR/VP), who serves as Vice-President of the European Commission, attends European Council meetings, chairs the Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) and may chair the Political and Security Committee (PSC) in times of crisis. The HR/VP proposes and implements CSDP decisions.6 Same composition as Committee of Permanent Representatives (COREPER) II, which also prepares for the CSDP-related work of the FAC. == Bodies and political leadership == === High Representative === The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, commonly referred to as the High Representative (HR/VP), is the chief co-ordinator and representative of the EU\\'s Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), including the CSDP. The position is currently held by Josep Borrell. Where foreign matters is agreed between EU member states, the High Representative can speak for the EU in that area, such as negotiating on behalf of the member states. Beside representing the EU at international fora and co-ordinating the CFSP and the CSDP, the HR/VP is: ex-officio Vice-President of the European Commission participant in the meetings of the European Council responsible of the European Union Special Representatives head of the External Action Service and the delegations President of the Foreign Affairs Council Head of the European Defence Agency Chairperson of the board of the European Union Institute for Security Studies === European Commission === Directorate-General for Defence Industry and Space, established in 2019 === External Action Service === The European External Action Service (EEAS) is the diplomatic service and foreign and defence ministry of the EU. The EEAS is led by the HR/VP and seated in Brussels. The EEAS does not propose or implement policy in its own name, but prepares acts to be adopted by the HR/VP, the European Commission or the Council. The EEAS is also in charge of EU diplomatic missions (delegations) and intelligence and crisis management structures.The following EEAS bodies take part in managing the CSDP: The Military Staff (EUMS) is an EEAS Directorate-General that provides strategic advice to the HR/VP and commands military operations through its Military Planning and Conduct Capability (MPCC) operational headquarters. The EUMS also reports to the European Union Military Committee (EUMC), representing member states\\' Chiefs of Defence, and performs \"early warning\", situation assessment and strategic planning. The EUMS currently consists of 200+ military and civilian personnel. The EUMS and the European Defence Agency (EDA) together form the Secretariat of the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO), the structural integration pursued by 25 of the 28 national armed forces of the EU since 2017. The Intelligence and Situation Centre (EU INTCEN) The Security and Defence College (ESDC) is a virtual institution for strategic level training. The ESDC consists of a network of various national institutions, such as defence colleges, and the European Union Institute for Security Studies. The ESDC initiated the European initiative for the exchange of young officers inspired by Erasmus, often referred to as military Erasmus, exchanging between armed forces of future military officers as well as their teachers and instructors during their initial education and training. Due to the fact that the initiative is implemented by the Member States on a purely voluntary basis, their autonomy with regard to military training is not compromised. The Crisis Management and Planning Directorate (CMPD) The Civilian Planning and Conduct Capability (CPCC) The Joint Support Coordination Cell (JSCC)The relationship between the High Representative, the Military Staff and Military Committee as of November 2017: Colour key: High Representative (a Vice-President of the Commission) Military Committee (EUMC; a Council body) Military Staff (EUMS; a Directorate-General of the External Action Service) === Council === The Council of the European Union has the following, Brussels-based preparatory bodies in the field of CSDP: The Political and Security Committee (PSC) consists of ambassadorial level representatives from the EU member states and usually meets twice per week. The PSC is chaired by the External Action Service. Ambassador Walter Stevens has been the PSC permanent chair since June 2013 The main functions of the PSC are keeping track of the international situation, and helping to define EU policies within the CFSP and CSDP. PSC sends guidance to, and receives advice from the European Union Military Committee (EUMC), the Committee for Civilian Aspects of Crisis Management (CIVCOM) as well as the European Union Institute for Security Studies. It is also a forum for dialogue on CSDP matters between the EU Member States. PSC also drafts opinions for the Foreign Affairs Council, which is one of the configurations of the Council of the European Union. CFSP matters are passed to the Foreign Affairs Council via COREPER II. The European Union Military Committee (EUMC) is composed of member states\\' Chiefs of Defence (CHOD). These national CHODs are regularly represented in the EUMC in Brussels by their permanent Military Representatives (MilRep), who often are two- or three-star flag officers. The EUMC is under the under authority of the EU\\'s High Representative (HR) and the Political and Security Committee (PSC). The EUMC gives military advice to the EU\\'s High Representative (HR) and Political and Security Committee (PSC). The EUMC also oversees the European Union Military Staff (EUMS). The Committee for Civilian Aspects of Crisis Management (CIVCOM) is an advisory body dealing with civilian aspects of crisis management. The activities of CIVCOM therefore forms part of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) of EU, and the civilian side of the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). CIVCOM is composed of representatives of the EU member states. The activities of CIVCOM for civilian CSDP tasks occur in parallel to the European Union Military Committee (EUMC) for military CDP tasks. Both EUMC and CIVCOM receive directions from, and report to the Political and Security Committee (PSC). The decision to establish CIVCOM was taken in 2000 by the Council of the European Union. The Politico-Military Group (PMG) carries out preparatory work for the Political and Security Committee (PSC). It covers the political aspects of EU military and civil-military issues, including concepts, capabilities and operations and missions. The tasks of the PMG include: 1) preparing Council conclusions and provides recommendations for the PSC, and monitoring their effective implementation 2) contributing to the development of horizontal policy and facilitating information exchanges. The PMG has a particular responsibility regarding partnerships with non-EU countries and other organisations, including EU-NATO relations, as well as exercises. The PMG is chaired by a representative of the HR/VP. === Agencies === The following agencies relate to the CSDP: The Defence Agency (EDA), based in Brussels, facilitates the improvement of national military capabilities and integration. In that capacity, it makes proposals, coordinates, stimulates collaboration, and runs projects. The Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex), based in Warsaw, Poland, leads the European coast guard that controls the borders of the Schengen Area. The Institute for Security Studies (ISS), based in Paris, is an autonomous think tank that researches EU-relevant security issues. The research results are published in papers, books, reports, policy briefs, analyses and newsletters. In addition, the institute convenes seminars and conferences on relevant issues that bring together EU officials, national experts, decision-makers and NGO representatives from all Member States. The Satellite Centre (SatCen), located in Torrejón de Ardoz, Spain, supports the decision-making by providing products and services resulting from the exploitation of relevant space assets and collateral data, including satellite and aerial imagery, and related services. == Permanent structured cooperation == The Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) is the framework in which 25 of the 28 national armed forces pursue structural integration. Based on Article 42.6 and Protocol 10 of the Treaty on European Union, introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009, PESCO was first initiated in 2017. The initial integration within the PESCO format is a number of projects planned to launch in 2018.PESCO is similar to enhanced co-operation in other policy areas, in the sense that integration does not require that all EU member states participate. == Funding of missions == == Defence industry coordination and research funding == The European Defence Fund is an EU-managed fund for coordinating and increasing national investment in defence research and improve interoperability between national forces. It was proposed in 2016 by President Jean-Claude Juncker and established in 2017 to a value of €5.5 billion per year. The fund has two stands; research (€90 million until the end of 2019 and €500 million per year after 2020) and development & acquisition (€500 million in total for 2019–20 then €1 billion per year after 2020).Together with the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence and Permanent Structured Cooperation it forms a new comprehensive defence package for the EU.EU-developed infrastructure for military use includes: European Secure Software-defined Radio Galileo (satellite navigation) == See also == Structure of NATO == Notes == == References == == Further reading == European Defence (2019), European Court of Auditors',\n",
              " 'Franz P. Freudenthal is a Bolivian physician who is known for several medical inventions, including a device that can cure heart ailments in children. == Career == Franz P. Freudenthal was born in La Paz, Bolivia to German immigrant parents. He was inspired to enter medicine by his grandmother, Dr. Ruth Tichauer of Wreszinski, who was born in Königsberg in 1910 daughter Walter Wreszinski and died in La Paz in 1995. He used to go with her as a child on her medical visits in remote rural areas of Bolivia. She was a pioneer in family planning and in outpatient treatment of tuberculosis, and shared her philosophy of life with Freudenthal. He attended the Higher University of San Andrés in La Paz for his undergraduate studies, then did his internship at Children\\'s Hospital of La Paz. He decided to specialize in pediatric cardiology. His wife, Alexandra Heath, is also a doctor. The couple received scholarships to take specialized training in Germany. He performed his first operation on a child in Germany in the 1990s.Freudenthal became interested in medical devices. He was part of a team that in March 1998 reported encouraging results of tests on neonatal lambs for occlusion of patent ductus arteriosus with a double-helix device at RWTH Aachen University, Germany. The devices used memory-shaped double-cone stainless steel coils mounted on a titanium/nickel core wire. Freudenthal said that by the age of 25 he had treated more than 20 sheep with devices, and at the age of 29 had treated his first patient, a child that could not be cured in any other way.After returning to Bolivia in 2003 the Freudenthals founded Kardiozentrum, a center for diagnosis and treatment of congenital heart disease. They also created PFM Bolivia, to develop and market medical devices. In 2014 Freudenthal was heading a team of 80 young innovators on a new project to develop a treatment for strokes. Freudenthal has taken out a number of patents including a left atrial appendage occlusion device, embolization device, tissue clip, tissue tack, snare mechanism for surgical retrieval and deployment device for cardiac surgery. == Nit Occlud device == Freudenthal is known for his Nit Occlud device for treatment of an infant heart problem. The prototypes were first tested on sheep, and since then have been used successfully by Freudenthal on hundreds of children, and have been exported around the world. The device treats a congenital disorder in the heart known as a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). This occurs when the ductus arteriosus blood vessel, which bypasses the lungs before a baby is born, fails to close up soon after birth. The affected infant suffers from labored breathing, failure to gain weight and other problems. The condition is much more common in Bolivia, where the country around La Paz is at an elevation of 4,000 metres (13,000 ft), than in other places.The device is made from a single wire of nitinol, a flexible alloy of nickel and titanium. Nitinol was originally developed by the US military. The tiny Nit Occlud devices are small and intricate, and difficult to mass-produce. Instead they are woven by Aymara women in a \"clean room\". It takes about two hours to make each device. The device can be placed without an invasive operation, using cardiac catheterization. Nitinol is able to memorize its shape. The device is folded up and inserted into a catheter which is inserted into the groin and then run through blood vessels to the position in the heart where it is to be placed. The device is released and returns to its original shape, blocking the hole that caused the heart problem. By using a minimally invasive approach the technique addresses the concerns of some indigenous people of Bolivia that to manipulate the heart is to desecrate the soul. It takes about 30 minutes to place the device.Technically, the Nit-Occlud ASD-R, is a double-umbrella, self-expanding, self-centering and premounted device knitted from a single nitinol wire without any soldering or protruding clamps or screws. The Nit-Occlud is similar to other self-expandable devices, which have provided excellent long-term clinical outcomes. The device has a unique shape that offers various advantages and a special snare-like release mechanism. It ranges in size from 8 to 30 millimetres (0.31 to 1.18 in) in stent diameter. The first human implantation was done at the La Paz Kardiocentrum by Alexandra Heath and coworkers. 53 implantations were made by this group from May 2007 to February 2011. Four attempts failed. Of the 53 implantations, complete closure occurred immediately in 71% of patients, and 100% after six months. Findings are generally very positive, although the erosion rate is not yet known.In August 2014 it was announced that Freudenthal had won the \"Innovators of America\" award in the Science and Technology category for his occlusion device to cure congenital heart disease in children. The award is given by Innovative America, is sponsored by the CAF – Development Bank of Latin America and the Spanish CAF Ezentis group, and was to be presented in Medellín, Colombia on 21 August 2014. As of 2014 the device had cured at least 50,000 children worldwide, and about 500 in Bolivia. == References == == External links == A new way to heal hearts without surgery - TED Talk by Franz Freudenthal == Sources ==',\n",
              " 'Carl Emil Krarup (12 October 1872 – 29/30 December 1909) was a Danish telegraph engineer who is chiefly known for the invention of a kind of loaded cable, eponymously called Krarup cable, which made improvements in the transmission of telephone signals, especially on submarine cables. == Career == Krarup was originally a civil engineer. He was in charge of public works in Copenhagen until 1898 when he joined the Danish Telegraph Administration. In 1901 he conducted research on loaded lines at the University of Würzburg in Germany. Returning to Denmark he continued the theoretical work at the University of Copenhagen and published a paper in 1902. == Krarup cable == Krarup cable is a method of loading lines to reduce their distortion. All practical methods of loading add series inductance to the cable to try to meet the Heaviside condition for no signal distortion. Krarup cable consists of iron wires wound tightly around the copper conducting cores and it is the iron that is the source of the additional inductance. However, it still does not have sufficient inductance to fully meet the Heaviside condition. Its construction also makes it expensive compared to the previously existing method of adding discrete loading coils at intervals along the cable. Against this, Krarup cable is lighter and easier to lay. The weight of early submarine cables using loading coils could cause excessive stress in the cable if not handled carefully. Additionally, Krarup cable has none of the problems of sealing the joins against seawater which was a major problem with loading coils before modern polymers began to be used. For these reasons, Krarup cable was popular on shorter distances, where the distortion was not so high that loading coils had to be used, until the advent of permalloy cable superseded it. The first cable to be laid with Krarup cable, indeed the first cable to be laid with any kind of continuous loading, was between Helsingør (Denmark) and Helsingborg (Sweden) in 1902. This cable was engineered by Krarup himself. == Notes == == References == Huurdeman, AA, The worldwide history of telecommunications, pp. 321–322, Wiley-IEEE, 2003.',\n",

The SO42− anions form both long and short Hg-O bonds ranging from 2.23 to 2.93 Å.Focusing on the shorter Hg-O bonds, the Hg – Hg – O bond angle is 165°±1°. == Preparation == One way to prepare mercury(I) sulfate is to mix the acidic solution of mercury(I) nitrate with 1 to 6 sulfuric acid solution:, Hg2(NO3)2 + H2SO4 → Hg2SO4 + 2 HNO3It can also be prepared by reacting an excess of mercury with concentrated sulfuric acid: 2 Hg + 2 H2SO4 → Hg2SO4 + 2 H2O + SO2 == Use in electrochemical cells == Mercury(I) sulfate is often used in electrochemical cells. It was first introduced in electrochemical cells by Latimer Clark in 1872, It was then alternatively used in Weston cells made by George Augustus Hulett in 1911. It has been found to be a good electrode at high temperatures above 100 °C along with silver sulfate.Mercury(I) sulfate has been found to decompose at high temperatures. The decomposition process is endothermic, and it occurs between 335 °C and 500 °C. Mercury(I) sulfate has unique properties that make the standard cells possible. It has a rather low solubility (about one gram per liter); diffusion from the cathode system is not excessive; and it is sufficient to give a large potential at a mercury electrode. == References ==',\n",
              " 'This article describes the Paschal candle of the Western Churches. For the Paschal triple-candle used in Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic churches see Paschal trikirion. A Paschal candle is a large, white candle used in liturgies in Western Christianity (viz., the Roman Catholic Church, the Lutheran Churches, the Anglican Communion, and the Methodist Churches, among others). A new Paschal candle is blessed and lit every year at Easter, and is used throughout the Paschal season which is during Easter and then throughout the year on special occasions, such as baptisms and funerals. The equivalent of the Paschal candle in the Western Orthodox Church is the Paschal trikirion, which differs in both style and usage. == Etymology == The term Paschal comes from the Latin word Pascha, which came from the Hebrew word Pesach, which in Hebrew means \\'Passover\\', and relates to the Paschal mystery of salvation. It is sometimes referred to as the \"Easter candle\" or the \"Christ candle.\" == Description == For congregations that use a Paschal candle, it is the largest candle in the worship space. In most cases today the candle will display several common symbols: The cross, which is the most prominent symbol and most clearly identifies it as the Paschal candle The Greek letters alpha and omega, which symbolize that God is the beginning and the end (from the Book of Revelation) The year when the particular candle is being used, which represents God amidst the present congregation Five grains of incense (most often red), which are embedded in the candle (sometimes encased in wax \"nails\") during the Easter Vigil to represent the five wounds of Jesus: the three nails that pierced his hands and feet, the spear thrust into his side, and the thorns that crowned his head.In the [medieval] Church, Paschal candles often reached a stupendous size. The Paschal candle of Salisbury Cathedral was said to have been 36 feet (11 metres) tall. Today, in the United States and Southern Europe (e.g., Italy and France) the candle is approximately 4 inches (10 centimetres) in diameter and 36 to 48 inches (91 to 122 centimetres) tall; in Northern Europe the candle tends to be shorter in height (19 to 24 inches/48 to 61 centimetres) and wider in diameter (3 to 5 inches/7.6 to 12.7 centimetres). == Usage == === Easter Vigil === For churches that celebrate the Easter Vigil on the night of Holy Saturday, the ceremonial lighting of the Paschal candle is one of the most solemn moments of the service. The Easter Vigil liturgies of the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, Anglican, Methodist and Presbyterian Churches are nearly identical.On Maundy Thursday of the same week the entire church is darkened by extinguishing all candles and lamps. This represents the darkness of a world without God. At the opening of the Easter Vigil a \"new fire\" is lit and blessed. The minister will trace the symbols (mentioned above) on the Paschal candle, saying words similar to: \"Christ, yesterday and today, the beginning and the end, the Alpha and Omega. To Him belongs all time and all the ages; all glory and dominion is his now and forever. Amen.\" They then insert five grains of incense (reminiscent of the nails used to fasten Christ on the Cross) on the five points of the cross, saying: \"By His holy and glorious wounds may Christ our Lord guard and keep us.\" The Paschal candle is the first candle to be lit with a flame from this sacred fire, representing the light of Christ coming into the world. This represents the risen Christ, as a symbol of light (life) dispelling darkness (death). As it is lit, the minister may say words similar to: \"The light of Christ, rising in Glory, dispel the darkness of our hearts and minds.\" Typically, the worshiping assembly then processes into the church led by the Paschal candle. The candle is raised three times during the procession, accompanied by the chant \"The light of Christ\" to which the assembly responds \"Thanks be to God\". In some communities, it is common for nearby churches of different Christian denominations (e.g. Catholic, Lutheran, Anglican, Methodist and Presbyterian) to make the new Easter Fire together and then after this, each congregation processes back to their own church with their own Paschal Candle for their Easter Vigil celebration; this is considered to be a fostering of ecumenism. Following the procession the Exultet is chanted, traditionally by a deacon, but it may be chanted by the priest or a cantor. The Exultet concludes with a blessing of the candle: Accept this Easter candle, a flame divided but undimmed, a pillar of fire that glows to the honor of God. (For it is fed by the holy melting wax, which the mother bee brought forth to make this precious candle.) Let it mingle with the lights of heaven and continue bravely burning to dispel the darkness of this night! May the Morning Star which never sets find this flame still burning: Christ, that Morning Star, who came back from the dead, and shed his peaceful light on all humanity, your Son, who lives and reigns for ever and ever. Amen. From the New Roman Missal: On this, your night of grace, O holy Father, accept this candle, a solemn offering, the work of bees and of your servants’ hands, an evening sacrifice of praise, this gift from your most holy Church. But now we know the praises of this pillar, which glowing fire ignites for God’s honor, a fire into many flames divided, yet never dimmed by sharing of its light, for it is fed by melting wax, drawn out by mother bees to build a torch so precious. O truly blessed night, when things of heaven are wed to those of earth, and divine to the human. Therefore, O Lord, we pray you that this candle, hallowed to the honor of your name, may persevere undimmed, to overcome the darkness of this night. Receive it as a pleasing fragrance, and let it mingle with the lights of heaven. May this flame be found still burning by the Morning Star: the one Morning Star who never sets, Christ your Son, who, coming back from death’s domain, has shed his peaceful light on humanity, and lives and reigns for ever and ever. R. Amen. In some traditions, the base of the candle may be ritually immersed in the baptismal font before proceeding with the remainder of the service. This candle is traditionally the one from which all other lights are taken for the Easter service. === Other times of the year === The candle remains lit at all worship services throughout Easter season which ends on Pentecost Sunday, (or in some traditions until Ascension Day, when it is extinguished just after the Gospel), during which time it is located in the sanctuary close to the altar. After the Easter season, it is frequently placed near the baptismal font. Before 1955, the option existed of blessing the baptismal font on the Vigil of Pentecost, and this was the only time the Paschal candle would be lit at services after Ascension. The Paschal candle is also lit during baptisms to signify the Holy Spirit and fire that John the Baptist promised to those who were baptised in Christ. During the baptismal rite in many traditions, a small lit candle will be given to the newly baptised by a member of the community, with words similar to, \"Let your light so shine before others, that they might see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.\" (Matthew 5:16) In the Novus Ordo, the Paschal candle is also lit and placed near the casket or urn during the funeral services such as the Mass of Repose and the Mass of Requiem. It is important to note that once lit the candle should remain burning until finished. This is to signify the hope of the resurrection into which Christians are baptised. == Eastern usage == In the Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic churches, there is no direct correspondence to the Western Paschal candle. However, throughout Bright Week, the priest carries a cross and paschal trikirion at all of the services, especially when censing, during the Little Entrance or when giving the Paschal greeting. The trikirion consists of three lit candles in a candlestick, which the priest carries in his left hand. In the Slavic tradition, the three candles may be white or different colors: green, red, blue. The deacon also carries a special Paschal candle which is a single large candle whenever he leads an ektenia (litany) or censes. == References == == External links == The Candle Carving Site Herbermann, Charles, ed.

              " 'Macaroni and cheese (also called mac and cheese in Canada and the United States and macaroni cheese in the United Kingdom) is a dish of cooked macaroni pasta and a cheese sauce, most commonly Cheddar sauce.The traditional macaroni and cheese is a casserole baked in the oven; however, it may be prepared in a sauce pan on top of the stove or using a packaged mix. The cheese is often first incorporated into a Béchamel sauce to create a Mornay sauce, which is then added to the pasta. In the United States, it is considered a comfort food. == History == Cheese and pasta casseroles were recorded in the 14th century in the Italian cookbook, Liber de Coquina, which featured a dish of Parmesan cheese and pasta. A cheese and pasta casserole known as makerouns was recorded in the 14th-century medieval English cookbook, the Forme of Cury. It was made with fresh, hand-cut pasta which was sandwiched between a mixture of melted butter and cheese. The recipe given (in Middle English) was: Take and make a thynne foyle of dowh. and kerve it on pieces, and cast hem on boiling water & seeþ it well. take cheese and grate it and butter cast bynethen and above as losyns. and serue forth. This is the above recipe in modern English: Make a thin sheet of dough and cut it in pieces. Place them in boiling water and boil them well. Take cheese and grate it and add it and place butter beneath and above as with losyns [a dish similar to lasagne], and serve. The first modern recipe for macaroni and cheese was included in Elizabeth Raffald\\'s 1769 book, The Experienced English Housekeeper. Raffald\\'s recipe is for a Béchamel sauce with cheddar cheese—a Mornay sauce in French cooking—which is mixed with macaroni, sprinkled with Parmesan, and baked until bubbly and golden.To dress Macaroni with Permasent [Parmasan] Cheese. Boil four Ounces of Macaroni ’till it be quite tender, and lay it on a Sieve to drain, then put it in a Tolling Pan, with about a Gill of good Cream, a Lump of Butter rolled in Flour, boil it five Minutes, pour it on a Plate, lay all over it Permasent Cheese toasted; send it to the Table on a Water Plate, for it soon goes cold.Another recipe from 1784 stated that the small tubes of macaroni must be boiled, then drained in a sifter before being moved to a frying pan. Heavy cream is then added to the macaroni along with a \"knob of butter\" rolled in flour, and it must be cooked for five minutes before being transferred to a dish and topped with toasted Parmesan and pepper. The famous British Victorian cookbook Mrs. Beeton\\'s Book of Household Management included two instances of \"Macaroni, as usually served with the Cheese Course\". One of them states: The macaroni, (which should be \"tender but perfectly firm, no part being allowed to melt, and the form entirely preserved\" – lest one be tempted to cook it for so long it actually disintegrated) is then topped with more cheese, pepper, and breadcrumbs, before receiving a final dose of melted butter for good measure and being placed before a \"bright fire\" to brown the crumbs, or grilled with a salamander broiler. In the United Kingdom, during the 2010s, it has seen a surge in popularity, becoming widespread as a meal and as a side order in both fast food and upmarket restaurants. === United States === The US president Thomas Jefferson and James Hemings, his slave, encountered macaroni in Paris and brought the recipe back to Monticello. Jefferson drew a sketch of the pasta and wrote detailed notes on the extrusion process. In 1793, he commissioned the US ambassador to France William Short to purchase a machine for making it. Evidently, the machine was not suitable, as Jefferson later imported both macaroni and Parmesan cheese for his use at Monticello. In 1802, Jefferson served \"a pie called macaroni\" at a state dinner. The menu of the dinner was reported by Reverend Manasseh Cutler, who apparently was not fond of the cheesy macaroni casserole. Nevertheless, since that time, baked macaroni and cheese has remained popular in the United States. A recipe called \"macaroni and cheese\" appeared in the 1824 cookbook The Virginia House-Wife written by Mary Randolph. Randolph\\'s recipe had three ingredients: macaroni, cheese, and butter, layered together and baked in a hot oven. The cookbook was the most influential cookbook of the 19th century, according to culinary historian Karen Hess. Similar recipes for macaroni and cheese occur in the 1852 Hand-book of Useful Arts, and the 1861 Godey\\'s Lady\\'s Book. By the mid-1880s, cookbooks as far west as Kansas and Festus, Missouri, included recipes for macaroni and cheese casseroles. Factory production of the main ingredients made the dish affordable, and recipes made it accessible, but not notably popular. As it became accessible to a broader section of society, macaroni and cheese lost its upper-class appeal. === Canada === Macaroni and cheese was brought to Canada by British immigrants, coming from other parts of the British Empire. Macaroni and cheese recipes have been attested in Canada since at least Modern Practical Cookery in 1845, which suggests a puff pastry lining (suggesting upper-class refinement); a sauce of cream, egg yolks, mace, and mustard; and grated Parmesan or Cheshire cheese on top. Canadian Cheddar cheese was also becoming popularized at this time and was likely also used during that era.Macaroni and cheese is very popular in contemporary Canada. Kraft Dinner is the most popular brand of packaged macaroni and cheese. Sasha Chapman, writing in The Walrus, considered it to be Canada\\'s national dish, ahead of poutine. In fact, Canadians purchase nearly 25% of the seven million boxes of Kraft Dinner sold worldwide each week. == Variations == Pasta other than macaroni are often used: almost any short-cut extruded pasta and many of the decorative cut pasta will do, particularly those with folds and pockets to hold the cheese. The dish may still be referred to as \"macaroni and cheese,\" \"mac n\\' cheese,\" or \"cheesy mac\" when made with a different pasta; while \"shells and cheese\" are sometimes used when it is made with conchiglie. While Cheddar cheese is most commonly used for macaroni and cheese, other cheeses may also be used — usually sharp in flavor — and two or more cheeses can be combined. Other cheeses can be used such as Gruyere, Gouda, Havarti, and Jarlsberg cheese.Macaroni and cheese can be made by simply layering slices of cheese and pasta (often with butter or evaporated milk) then baking in a casserole, rather than preparing as a cheese sauce. Also, some like to include a crunchy topping to their baked macaroni and cheese by topping it off with bread crumbs or crushed crackers, which also keeps the noodles on top from drying out when baking. One novelty presentation is deep-fried macaroni and cheese found at fairs and food carts. === Regional variations and analogues === In Scotland, macaroni and cheese can often be found in pies, known endearingly as a macaroni pie. A similar traditional dish in Switzerland, dating from the 19th century, is called Älplermagronen (Alpine herder\\'s macaroni), which is also available in boxed versions. Älplermagronen are made of macaroni, cream, cheese, roasted onions, and in some recipes, potatoes. In the Canton of Uri, the potatoes are traditionally omitted, and in some regions, bacon or ham is added. The cheese is often Emmental cheese or Appenzeller cheese. It is usually accompanied by apple sauce. == Prepared and packaged mixes == Packaged macaroni and cheese are available in frozen form or as boxed ingredients for simplified preparation. Boston Market, Michelina\\'s, Kraft Foods, Cracker Barrel, and Stouffer\\'s are some of the more recognizable brands of prepared and frozen macaroni and cheese available in the United States. \"Macaroni and cheese loaf\", a deli meat which contains both macaroni and processed cheese bits, can be found in some stores.A variety of packaged mixes that are prepared in a sauce pan on the stove or in a microwave oven are available. They are usually modeled on Kraft Macaroni & Cheese (known as Kraft Dinner or KD in Canada), which was introduced in 1937 with the slogan \"make a meal for four in nine minutes.\" It was an immediate success in the US and Canada amidst the economic hardships of the Depression. During the Second World War, rationing led to increased popularity for the product which could be obtained two boxes for one food rationing stamp. The 1953 Better Homes and Gardens Cookbook includes a recipe using Velveeta, which had been reformulated in that year. The boxed Kraft product is popular in Canada, where it is the most-purchased grocery item in the country.Boxed mixes consist of uncooked pasta and either a liquid cheese sauce (often labeled \"deluxe\") or powdered ingredients to prepare it. The powdered cheese sauce is mixed with either milk or water, and margarine, butter, or olive oil and added to the cooked pasta. Some mixes prepared in a microwave cook the pasta in the sauce. Another popular variant is jarred macaroni cheese sauce, which is especially popular in the UK and US, available under the Dolmio and Ragú brands, among others. The pasta is purchased and prepared separately, then mixed with the heated cheese sauce. Powdered cheese sauce, very similar to what is found inside a box of macaroni and cheese mix, is also sold without the pasta. This product is produced by several companies, most notably Bisto, Cabot, Annie\\'s and Kraft Foods. Canned or tinned macaroni and cheese is available in supermarkets in the US and UK, with Heinz being the most prominent brand in the UK. These are often served on toast as a snack or as part of a breakfast. A number of different products on the market use this basic formulation with minor variations in ingredients.Although high in carbohydrates, calories, fat, and salt, macaroni and cheese is a source of protein and certain variations of the dish can decrease the negative health aspects. == See also == == References == == Further reading == Carroll, Linda (July 17, 2017). \"How harmful are the chemicals in your boxes of mac and cheese?\".

His work in the Viceroyalty of Peru was greatly influential on the Cuzco School art movement. == Biography == Angelino Medoro was born in 1567 in present-day Italy, however there is conflicting information on the city of birth. He was born in either Rome, which was part of Papal States during this time; or Naples, which was part of the Kingdom of Sicily. Medoro is thought to have studied art in Rome, followed by travelled to Seville, and to New Kingdom of Granada (present-day Colombia). His only surviving European artwork was the painting \"Flagellation of Christ\" (1586) in Seville.Medoro, alongside Bernardo Bitti, and Matteo da Lecce (or Matteo Pérez de Alesio in Spanish) were the three founders of Peruvian colonial painting. His earliest work in the Americas was Virgen de la Antigua (1587–1588) in the Santo Domingo church in Bogotá. In 1617, he painted a portrait of Saint Rosa of Lima at Santuario Santa Rosa de Lima (also known as Church of Santa Rosa in Lima).His students included Pedro de Loayza (or Pedro Loayza), Luis de Riaño, and Juan de Mesa.Medoro returned to Spain after 1620, and died in Seville in 1631. == See also == Pedro Bedón Spanish colonization of the Americas == References == == Further reading == Gutiérrez, Ramón (1995).

It was built in 1658 as the sixth of the De Redin towers. An artillery battery was built around it in 1715. Today, the tower and battery are intact. After receiving 3 years of restoration work the tower was reopened to the public on the 9th of June 2021. Aħrax Tower is the northernmost fortification on the main island of Malta. == History == Aħrax Tower was built by November 1658 in the area known as \"l-Aħrax tal-Mellieħa\". Construction had cost 589 scudi, 5 tari and 15 grani. Its structure is similar to the other De Redin towers, having a square base and two floors. However, the base of Aħrax Tower is slightly larger than some of the other towers. An escutcheon once stood over the main doorway with De Redin\\'s coat of arms, although this is no longer in place. Just as was the case with Għajn Ħadid Tower, a well was located close to the tower to supply water to the militia stationed in the tower. In 1715, an artillery battery was built around the tower, and it was called Batteria della Harach. The battery consisted of a semicircular gun platform with an en barbette parapet, a blockhouse that was built on the western wall of the tower, and two walls linking the tower to the gun platform. It was surrounded by a rock hewn ditch.In the 1743 inspection, Aħrax Tower was armed with two bronze cannons, gun wheels and stocks, sixteen cannonballs, four muskets, one rotolo of musket balls and ten rotolos of gunpowder. Thirty years later, in 1770, the battery was armed with ten iron cannons with 700 iron balls and 150 grapeshot rounds. The gunpowder was stored in Saint Agatha\\'s Tower. In the 19th century, the British used the tower as a naval station and they added several rooms to the tower\\'s structure. At a point it served as the Governor\\'s summer residence and a British coat of arms replaced De Redin\\'s personal arms. After World War II the tower was privately owned but it was eventually abandoned. == Present day == The area around the tower is now covered with concrete and the foundations of some walls of the battery have never been excavated. Over the years Aħrax Tower was heavily modified so it is now difficult to see which parts are original and which were added later. The battery remains largely intact, with the exception of one of the linking walls. In 2009, the tower was passed to the Mellieħa Local Council.In November 2016 the tower was granted to heritage NGO Din l-Art Ħelwa for a loan period of 10 years, with the scope of this agreement being the conservation, restoration and rehabilitation of the building. The works were finished in June 2021 and the tower was reopened to the general public for educational purposes. == References == == External links == National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands YouTube video showing a 3D model of Aħrax Tower and Battery',\n",

It is bordered by 35th Street NW to the east, Reservoir Road NW and the historic Georgetown district to the south, Whitehaven Park to the north, and Glover Archbold Park to the west. The neighborhood is home to the Duke Ellington School of the Arts and the Washington International School (primary campus). == History == The history of Burleith can be traced back to 1886, when the Huidekoper family came into ownership of the Burleith tract of land. During their tenure as residents, they built a few buildings, but kept most of the land as woods and fields. In 1922 the Huidekopers sold the land to Shannon and Luchs, Inc. Instead of keeping the land in its natural state like the previous owners, Shannon and Luchs decided to hire an architect to develop the area. The architect designed homes with moderate prices between $8,950-$13,500 that were targeted for middle class residents with \"moderate income, but above average taste\". == Burleith Citizens Association == In 1925 the Burleith Citizens Association was developed to deal with civic and social issues concerning the neighborhood. Issues have included parking, noise control, traffic lights, and the relationship with neighboring Georgetown University. The Association also plans social activities, such as picnics and children events. Burleith is in Ward 2 and belongs to ANC 2E along with Georgetown and Hillandale. == Hillandale == To the west of Burleith is a 24-hour gated community called Hillandale; some consider this a separate neighborhood but it is technically part of Burleith. Residents of Hillandale have included U.S. Senators Joseph Lieberman (I-Connecticut) and Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), former NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue and Georgetown University President John J. DeGioia. Prior to 1979, Hillandale was an estate owned by John Dustin Archbold\\'s family. == References == == External links == Burleith.org - neighborhood website Guide to the Burleith Citizens Association records, 1926-2001, Special Collections Research Center, Estelle and Melvin Gelman Library, The George Washington University.

Up to four subspecies are listed by some authors, while others consider the willow beauty a monotypic species or accept only rhomboidaria and sublutearia as distinct: Peribatodes rhomboidaria corsicaria (Schawerda 1931) Peribatodes rhomboidaria defloraria (Dannehl 1928) Peribatodes rhomboidaria rhomboidaria (Denis & Schiffermüller, 1775) Peribatodes rhomboidaria sublutearia (Zerny 1927)Under its junior synonym Geometra rhomboidaria, the willow beauty is the type species of its genus Peribatodes. This was initially proposed as a subgenus of Boarmia but eventually elevated to full genus rank. == Description and ecology == The adult\\'s wingspan is 40–48 mm. The wings of this species are whitish-grey or -yellowish, though they have a buff or grey appearance from a distance, as they are heavily speckled with brown or black dots. Running over the fore- and hindwings in a semicircle are the two blackish bands commonly found in Ennominae, but they are broken and somewhat indistinct in this species. A tell-tale characteristic is a single bulge in the forewing part of the outer blackish bands. Melanic forms (e.g. rebeli) sometimes occur. The sexes can be distinguished by their antennae, which are strongly feathered in the male, but almost smooth in the female. See similar species (below) This moth inhabits woodland, gardens and similar habitat. Either one or two generations occur each year, depending on locality. The adults are on the wing during summer – e.g. June to September on the British Isles, while in the more continental climate of Austria they are rarely seen anymore in late August. They fly at night and are attracted to light.The caterpillar larva is reddish-brown and feeds on a variety of trees and shrubs, but – despite its name – rarely or never on willows (Salix). The species overwinters as a small larva. As evidenced by the species distribution, it does not seem to tolerate severe and dry winters very well. === Recorded food plants === Willow beauty larvae are highly polyphagous and not adapted to a specific lineage of foodplants. Rather, they eat foliage of a wide range of eudicots, as well as some other plants. Recorded foodplants include: Betula (birch) Camellia sinensis (tea) Clematis (clematises) – not in Finland Crataegus (hawthorn) Hedera (ivy) Ligustrum (privet) – not in Finland Malus (apple) Prunus (plum, cherry, peach) – including blackthorn (P. spinosa) – not in Finland – and possibly others Taxus (yew) Vitis (grapevine) == Synonyms == Junior synonyms of the willow beauty include: Geometra rhomboidaria Denis & Schiffermüller, 1775 Boarmia corsicaria Schawerda, 1931 Boarmia defloraria Dannehl, 1928 Peribatodes dragone de Laever & Parenzan, 1986 Boarmia psoralaria Millière, 1885 Boarmia syritaurica Wehrli, 1931 == Similar species == Peribatodes rhomboidaria is difficult to certainly distinguish from its congeners.

              " 'The Big 30 All-Star Football Game is a high school football all-star game held in the Twin Tiers region of Western New York and northern Pennsylvania. The game is held annually each August at Parkway Field on the campus of Bradford Area High School in Bradford, Pennsylvania and is broadcast live on radio station WESB. Each team consists of 43 players from a 15 school-district area in each state (15+15 being the \"30\" indicated in the game\\'s title). New York\\'s team covers mostly Cattaraugus County, portions of Allegany County, and two small districts in southeastern Chautauqua County, while Pennsylvania\\'s team covers a five-county area including Warren, McKean, Cameron, Potter and Elk Counties. This area roughly, though not exactly, corresponds to the coverage area of the Olean Times Herald, the major newspaper serving the region. The players are mostly high school graduates; some go on to play college football but many do not. Unlike most high school football games in New York and Pennsylvania, most games have full fifteen-minute quarters; the standard for most high school games is twelve minutes.Through 2015, there have been 42 contests. New York leads the series 22-18-2. The Empire State defeated the Keystone State by a 46–37 score in the 2010 game, but most recent matches had mostly been won by Pennsylvania, including a 27–0 shutout in 2008, a 13–6 win by the Keystone State in 2009, where Pennsylvania held New York to zero completed passes, and a 28–3 win in 2011 built primarily on two New York fumbles. The 2012 game was won by New York. New York won the 2015 contest by a margin of 44–8, a record for the event.The Big 30 Charities Classic expanded to men\\'s and women\\'s basketball contests in 2015, with the inaugural contests held on March 15, 2015. WGWE broadcast the games, which were held at the high school in Portville, New York. From approximately 2003 to 2015, the football game was named the Don Raabe Big 30 Charities Classic after Don Raabe, one of the founders of the game. Disputes with Raabe\\'s estate, trademark concerns and a decline in funds prompted the game organizers to remove his name from the game\\'s title.The 2020 Edition of the game was cancelled due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. == References == Area players look to earn win for Pennsylvania.

              " 'Sarıkız, Ayışığı, Yakamoz, Eldiven were the names of alleged Turkish military coup plans in 2004. == Plans == In 2007, the Nokta weekly published portions of a diary purportedly belonging to the retired general Özden Örnek, indicating that four coup plans were prepared: Sarıkız (blonde girl; idiomatic for \\'cow\\'), Ayışığı (moonlight), Yakamoz (Sea Sparkle), and Eldiven (glove). some have argued the names are code for army, airforce, navy, and police respectfully Admiral Örnek himself called the diary a forgery. The Armed Forces evaded the issue without denying its authenticity altogether. For his part, general Hurşit Tolon said he found no reason to object to the publication of the diaries since they contained no false statements about him. The diary was not used as evidence in the 2455-page-long indictment. Eldiven indicated a \"discord within the Turkish Armed Forces\" on the matter of supporting coup plans and proposed remedies to overcome it. The main purpose of Eldiven was to \"shape the TSK, Parliament, the bureaucracy and local governments and rewrite the Constitution, the entire legislation and the National Security Policy Document.\" According to the alleged plan, cell organizations of people from different segments of society would be formed. These would be unaware of each other\\'s existence and work without knowing the ultimate purpose for which they were serving. These guerrilla tactics had been employed earlier by the Counter-Guerrilla, the Turkish branch of Operation Gladio. The plan called for psychological warfare to shape public opinion. The first stage of the plan was to ensure national consensus, shaping decisions taken by the Supreme Military Council (Turkish: Yüksek Askerî Şûra, YAŞ) by talking to journalists and having them publish the ideas of active generals. The plan also involved then-President Ahmet Necdet Sezer in shaping the YAŞ.Eldiven proposed to support and use the media to exhaust liberal and democratic political opponents and rally public opinion behind the army\\'s plans. Speaking to the newspaper Taraf, political analyst Ali Bayramoğlu said that the major newspapers were aware of the coup plans, since they had been approached by the generals for support, but that they did not initially write about it. When the generals realized that the broad support they had sought was not forthcoming, they fell into disarray. Şener Eruygur, in particular, drew up a plan to undertake a coup by himself. He is currently under custody. Sarp Kuray, a leftist who was sentenced to life imprisonment after the 1971 coup, likened these plans to the 1971 coup attempt, which had been thwarted by intelligence reaching the Chief of Staff, Memduh Tağmaç. == Authenticity == The diary was corroborated by minutes of the meeting on which the diary was based, which were found in the home of retired captain Muzaffer Yıldırım. Along with Tolon and Eruygur, Yıldırım was detained as part of an investigation into a conspiratorial organization named \"Ergenekon\".The diary was not mentioned in the Ergenekon indictment. Görmüş said this was because the diary was obtained illegally and therefore inadmissible in a court of law. == Selected quotes == The newspaper Today\\'s Zaman reproduced portions of the diary: ... Upon the suggestion of Gendarmerie Forces Commander Gen. Şener Eruygur, we went to the social facilities of the gendarmerie. (...) We decided to form an action plan on our own. We were first going to take control of the media, so I was going to invite M.Ö. for that purpose. We were going to keep in contact with rectors and arrange for students to engage in demonstrations. We were going to act in unison with unions. We were going to get posters hung in the streets. We were going to contact associations and incite them against the government. We were going to do all of this across the country, and it would be known as Sarıkız. ... They all gathered at the headquarters of the gendarmerie, and Gen. Eruygur showed them the preparations I had been shown on Tuesday and had them listen to a number of voice recordings that belong to some high-ranking government officials. Most of them were advisors to the Justice and Development Party and in the recordings they share their ideas on how they are planning to handle the Cyprus problem. At the end of the briefing, the commander of the Air Forces (Gen. İbrahim Fırtına) and the commander of the Gendarmerie Forces (Eruygur) started pressing for a revolution on March 10. (...) Eruygur\\'s target is to become the commander of the Land Forces. (...) The current commander of the Land Forces (Gen. Aytaç Yalman) told me how Eruygur is digging a pit for (Chief of General Staff Gen.) Yaşar (Büyükanıt). To me, the commander of the Gendarmerie Forces was acting a little unfairly and in an overly ambitious manner. ... We gathered in my house with the commanders of the air forces, the navy, the army and the gendarmerie forces at 2 p.m. … The second topic again turned out to be the same one, \\'We should topple these fellows,\\' was what we discussed. Şener and the air guy (Fırtına) are pressing too much for this. Şener can\\'t get it out of his mind; he repeats the same thing every two words. So does the air guy. If we don\\'t want to give away Cyprus, our furthest limit is April 9, 2004. Whatever we must do, we should do before that. == Ergenekon charges == These excerpts were later cited as key evidence in the March 2009 indictment of a round of suspects, including retired generals Eruygur and Tolon, arrested in the course of the ongoing investigations into the alleged illegal Ergenekon organization and charged with plotting to overthrow the legal government of the Republic of Turkey. == References == == External links == Full text of coup diaries, as published in \"İşte darbe günlüklerinin tam metni\".

              " 'Mit\\'a (Quechua pronunciation: [ˈmɪˌtʼa]) was mandatory service in the society of the Inca Empire. Its close relative, the regionally mandatory Minka is still in use in Quechua communities today and known as faena in Spanish. Historians use the Hispanicized term mita to differentiate the system as it was modified and intensified by the Spanish colonial government, creating the encomienda system. Mit\\'a was effectively a form of tribute to the Inca government in the form of labor, i.e. a corvée. Tax labor accounted for much of the Inca state tax revenue; beyond that, it was used for the construction of the road network, bridges, agricultural terraces, and fortifications in ancient Peru. Military service was also mandatory. All citizens who could perform labor were required to do so for a set number of days out of a year (the basic meaning of the word mit\\'a is a regular turn or a season). The Inca Empire\\'s wealth meant a family often needed only 65 days to farm; the rest of the year was devoted entirely to the mit\\'a. A relative of the Mit\\'a (federal work) is the modern Quechua system of Minka or faena, which is mostly applied at small-scale villages. The Minka was adopted during the 1960s on large-scale federal projects of Peru. == Religious worship == The Incas elaborated creatively on a preexisting system of not only the mit\\'a exchange of labor but also the exchange of the objects of religious veneration of the peoples whom they took into their empire. This exchange ensured proper compliance among conquered peoples. In this instance, wak\\'as and paqarinas became significant centers of shared worship and a point of unification of their ethnically and linguistically diverse empire, bringing unity and citizenship to often geographically disparate peoples. That eventually led to a system of pilgrimages throughout all of these various shrines by the indigenous people of the empire prior to the introduction of Catholicism. Enormous construction of highways and structures were possible in part only by the use of the mit\\'a. All the people worked for the government for a certain period of time. This labor was free for the Inca Rule. During the Inca period, men were required to work 65 days in the field to provide food for his family. When someone\\'s turn came, he joined the various works that used the mit\\'a. A communal type of elemental provisions and needs was set up in order to care for the families of those who were absent in their Mita turn. People worked in building highways, the construction of homes for the emperor and nobility, monuments, bridges, fields belonging to priests and the emperor, and mines. == System == All males starting at the age of fifteen were required to participate in the mit\\'a to do public services. This remained mandatory until the age of fifty. However, the Inca rule was flexible on the amount of time one could share on the mit\\'a turn. Overseers were responsible to make sure that a person after fulfilling his duty in the mit\\'a still had enough time to care for his own land and family. The construction of bridges and oroyas was the responsibility of the local ethnic groups, who divided the work according to the mita system, with the population divided into hanan and urin or ichuq (ichoc) and allawqa (allauca) (upper and lower, left and right). During viceregal times, the Andean method of distributing labor obligations among the ethnic groups was preserved, which permitted the continued maintenance of these public works. The war mit\\'a took men from their ayllus to serve in the state armies. All labor in the Andean world was performed as a rotational service, whether for maintaining the tampus, roads, bridges or for guarding the storehouses or other such tasks. The craftspeople enjoyed a special status in the Inca state. Although they worked for the state, they did not take part in the agricultural or war mit\\'a. The agrarian mit\\'a was distinct from the fishing mit\\'a, and these labor groups never intervened in each other\\'s occupations. In the señorio of Chincha, the fishermen numbered ten thousand, and went to sea in turns, the rest of the time enjoying themselves by dancing and drinking. The Spaniard criticized them as lazy drunkards because they did not go to sea daily and all at once. The mining mit\\'a was also fulfilled at the level of ayllus, of the local lord, and, in the last instance, of the state. The significance of the term mit\\'a goes beyond that of the system for organizing labor. It contains a certain Andean philosophical concept of eternal repetition. The constellation of the Pleiades, called cabrillas (\"little goats\") by the Spaniards, were known as unquy (Quechua for \"disease\", Hispanicized oncoy) during the rainy season mit\\'a, and as qullqa (Quechua for \"storehouse\") during the season of harvest and abundance. The seasons were divided into the dry mit\\'a and the rainy mit\\'a. The day mit\\'a succeeded the night mit\\'a in a repetition that reflected an ordering of time that the natives conceptualized as a cyclical organizational system of order and chaos. == Categorization of lands == During the Inca period people were mostly dependent on the cultivation of their land. All the fields of the Empire were divided into four categories: the Field of the Temple, the Emperor, Kurakas (Curacas), and People. Fields of the people were fields that belonged to the sick, widows, the elderly, wives of the soldiers and that of his own land. At the beginning of plowing time, people started to work first at the fields of widows, of sick people and of wives of the soldiers under the direction of the village overseers. Then, they worked on their own field. Next, they worked on the Temples fields and Kuraka fields and finally, they set to work on the Emperor\\'s fields. While they worked on the Emperor\\'s field, they typically wore their best dress and men and women chanted songs in praise to the Inca. When people were engaged in war, their fields were cultivated by people engaged in mit\\'a. That way, soldiers would go to war with their fields and family secured and protected, which enhanced the loyalty and the focus on the part of Incan soldiers. == Spanish rule == Under the Viceroy Francisco de Toledo, communities were required to provide one seventh of their male labor force at any given time for public works, mines and agriculture. The system became an intolerable burden on the Inca communities and abuses were common. Complaints and revolts occurred and new laws were passed by Philip III but they only had a limited effect. The Inca and Spanish mitas served different purposes. The Inca mit\\'a provided public goods, such as maintenance of road networks and sophisticated irrigation and cropping systems that required intercommunity coordination of labor. The majority of Inca subjects performed their mit\\'a obligations in or near their home communities, often in agriculture; service in mines was extremely rare. In contrast, the Spanish mita acted as a subsidy to private mining interests and the Spanish nation, which used tax revenues from silver production largely to finance European wars.A 2021 study in the Journal of Economic History found that the colonial mita system in Peru caused the decimation of the male native-born population. == Working in mines == The Spanish conquistadors also used the same labor system to supply the workforce they needed for the silver mines, which was the basis of their economy in the colonial period. Under the leadership of Viceroy Francisco de Toledo, who was dispatched to Peru in 1569, the mit\\'a system greatly expanded as Toledo sought to increase silver outputs from the Potosí silver mine. Toledo recognized that without a steady, reliable and inexpensive source of labor, mining would not be able to grow at the speed that the Spanish crown had requested. Under Toledo\\'s leadership, the first mita recruits arrived in Potosí in 1573 from the regions directly surrounding the Potosi mine. At its peak, recruitment for the Potosi mita extended to an area that was nearly 200,000 square miles (520,000 km2) and included much of southern Peru and present-day Bolivia. The conquistadors used the concept of mit\\'a to suit their own needs. Mit\\'a is considered to be the ancient and original version of mandatory state service. The Spanish mita system had severe impacts on the native population, which was of able-bodied workers at a time while their communities were experiencing demographic collapse from epidemics of Old World diseases. It also resulted in natives fleeing their communities to evade the mit\\'a. With fewer workers able to work the fields, the farming production went down, resulting in famine and malnutrition for many native communities in the region. Research by Melissa Dell found that the mining mita resulted in negative long-term effects for the regions where it occurred. This included lower levels of education and household consumption, less developed road networks, and a decrease in public good provision (due to there being very few haciendas, whose owners generally supported greater provision of public goods). == Mitma resettlement system == The mit\\'a labor tribute is not to be confused with the related Inca policy of deliberate resettlements referred to by the Quechua word mitma (mitmaq means \"outsider\" or \"newcomer\") or its Hispanicized forms, mitima or mitimaes (plural). That involved transplanting whole groups of people of Inca background as colonists into new lands inhabited by newly conquered peoples. The aim was to distribute loyal Inca subjects throughout their empire to limit the threat of localized rebellions. == Lasting effects == Mita districts historically achieved lower levels of education, and today, they remain less integrated into road networks. Finally, data from the most recent agricultural census document that residents of mita districts are substantially more likely to be subsistence farmers since haciendas, rural estates with an attached labor force, were banned in mita districts to minimize the competition the state faced in accessing scarce mita labor. It was the hacienda elite that possessed the political connections required to secure public goods such as roads. The hacienda elites were the ones who were lobbying for roads as many haciendas as possible, and empirical evidence links roads to increased market participation and higher household income.The fact that farmers from mit\\'a districts do not have greater access to paved roads means that they are unable to transport crops to larger, regional markets. It is unlikely that these farmers simply do not wish to participate in the market. In the case of Peru, throughout the 1980s, Shining Path, as part of their Maoist ideology, attempted to turn farmers away from commercial farming; their efforts were largely unpopular and met with resistance.More recently, in 2004, residents of Ilave, a mita district, lynched their local mayor, in part for his inability to follow through with promises to pave the town\\'s access road and build a local market. Overall, former mita districts suffer from lower economic performance, as demonstrated by generally lower household consumption and increased rates of stunted growth. Without haciendas to compete with the more exploitative Spanish system, mita districts were subjected to greater economic and health pressures from their labor. Melissa Dell has shown that the repercussions of this disparity have persisted past the end of the mita system as mit\\' districts were less integrated with the greater road network. == Government application in modern Peru == The only example of re-applying the Inca-style Mit\\'a in a modern state, as a government policy, occurred in Peru during the two Popular Action governments under President Fernando Belaúnde Terry (1963 - 1968 and 1980 - 1985). Under this government, a state institution called \"Popular Cooperation\" was launched, strongly inspired by the strategy of labor tribute in the Incan mit\\'a. During the 10 years this institution operated, more infrastructure projects were accomplished in Peru than in most of the 140-year Republican era (from 1821 to 1963). The results were hundreds of kilometers of roads, aqueducts, communal and municipal works and other infrastructure pieces. === Popular cooperation === The principle of the institution was quite simple: given the rather scarce economic resources of the Peruvian State in the early 1960s, the public works that this institution would do should have been \"co-financed\" by the beneficiaries, namely through contributions of labor. In any given public works project in Peru, it is estimated that between 60 and 70% of the cost goes to the acquisition of materials, and the remaining 30-40% are labor costs. Applying the principle of the Incan mit\\'a , the government fronted the acquisition of goods, and the beneficiaries provided the labor services without salary; this allowed the Peruvian State to save 30-40% for public works during this period - these savings were invested in further public works projects. The beneficiaries in turn contributed their communal workforce in exchange for accelerated development of their communities and the expansion of infrastructure in Peru. === South Korean commission === In 1964, the government of the Republic of Korea became aware of the significant results achieved in Peru, and sent a commission to meet with the Peruvian government. The commission studied the methodology and organization of the Peruvian labor tribute institution and the feasibility of applying it to the Republic of Korea. After a few months in Peru, the commission returned to South Korea and rolled out their own modern version of the Incan mit\\'a to Korean production systems, including the manufacturing industry. The results obtained in Korea were even more positive than those obtained in Peru due to a different development approach. == See also == Mink\\'a (Quechuan mandatory communal work, also known as faena) Ayni (Quechuan personal reciprocity) Repartimiento Encomienda Corvée Tribute == Notes == == References ==',\n",

              " 'Cora Mae Bryant (May 1, 1926 – October 30, 2008) was an American blues musician. She was the daughter of another American blues musician, Curley Weaver. Bryant released two solo albums in her lifetime on the Music Maker label.Part of her home in Oxford, Georgia, was thought of as a \\'blues museum\\'. Her own music largely derived from the influence of attending impromptu performances and house parties, including her father, plus Blind Willie McTell, Buddy Moss, and other local blues musicians of the early 1930s. == Biography == She was born Cora Mae Weaver in Oxford, Newton County, Georgia, United States. She was the daughter of Curley Weaver, and started singing at the age of six in the New Bethel Baptist Church in Walnut Grove, Georgia. With her father often absent performing and recording, Bryant was part-raised by her grandmother, Savannah Shepard, who lived in Almon, Georgia. Bryant often spent days and nights with her grandmother, who had both a piano and guitar, and often played them and sang to entertain the young girl. Bryant maintained that was where her father had earlier obtained his own basic musical intuition. She once said, \"When the weekend came, Daddy would come and get me. We did not know the difference between night and day.\"She started attending fish fries and barbecues around her home state with her father, and through these connections got to meet Buddy Moss, Blind Willie McTell and others, including the unrecorded guitarist Johnny Guthrie. They played generally outside for the entertainment of locals and Bryant obtained her education in Georgia blues. She later found casual employment in her mid-twenties, with her father picking cotton for a living. Curley Weaver died in 1962. Bryant began to perform in her own right, although one researcher wryly noted that \"Clyde Langford and Cora Mae Bryant, kin to Lightnin\\' Hopkins and Curley Weaver respectively, but very distant from them in talent\". Her own songwriting was slow to get started, but Bryant found the process easy to accomplish. She stated \"I don\\'t get no pencil and write \\'em. One song, we was sittin\\' up there just talkin\\', me and my granddaughter, and I said, \"Yeah, if you got anything in layaway, you better get it out.\" And I made a song of that\". Also, Bryant\\'s knowledge of early blues in Atlanta and Georgia, was used as a source by the music historians Peter B. Lowry and Bruce Bastin. Her own recording career was late in commencing before Dave Peabody\\'s 1997 album, Down in Carolina, contained a guest appearance from Bryant on her penned track, \"McTell, Moss, & Weaver\".She gradually became important on the Atlanta blues scene; performing, organizing \"Giving It Back\" festivals at the city\\'s Northside Tavern to honor early blues artists, and as a frequent caller to local blues radio shows. In addition, her collection of memorabilia continued to expand; \"... a little pale gray bench, that she said Blind Willie McTell used to sit on to play\" was donated to Bryant\\'s \\'museum\\' housed in a side room in her home in Oxford. Bryant was the subject of articles in both Living Blues magazine in February 1998 and in Music Makers in 2002.In 2001, Bryant recorded her debut album, Born with the Blues, which was released on the supportive Music Maker label. In July 2002, Bryant appeared at the Mississippi Valley Blues Festival, accompanied by the guitarist Josh Jacobson, performing songs from Born with the Blues. Her song \"You Was Born to Die\" had previously appeared on the compilation album, fRoots 7 (1996), while \"It Was Weaver\" appeared on Soul Bag N°192 (2008). Further tracks were included on Music Maker\\'s own compilation, Sisters of the South (2003). Her own second label, Born in Newton County, came out the same year.In 2005, Bryant was living at home in Oxford when suffered a stroke. She died of natural causes on the morning of October 30, 2008, at the age of 82. == Legacy == Bryant\\'s track, \"Born to Die\" was played by Cerys Matthews on the UK\\'s BBC Radio 2 in April 2015. \"It Was Weaver\" had been aired in June 2014, on a NTS Radio show hosted by Charlie Bones. == Discography == == References == == External links == Painting and videos @ Northsidetavern.com Family placed death notice',\n",

              " \"The Wisconsin Wolfpack was an American football franchise based in Wisconsin. The Wolfpack name and brand was used for two teams: an indoor football team in the Continental Indoor Football League and a traditional (outdoor) football team in the Mid Continental Football League. The indoor team played its home games at the Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Madison, Wisconsin in its inaugural season of 2009, but moved to the Hartmeyer Arena for the 2010 season. The outdoor team was somewhat nomadic throughout its history with regards to where it played its home games, however, outdoor games were generally played in the Milwaukee metropolitan area. == Indoor history == Prior to the Wolfpack franchise's 2008 outdoor campaign, the Milwaukee Bonecrushers of the Continental Indoor Football League approached the Wolfpack coaches and staff and asked them to assist with the completion of their 2008 season following Gilbert Brown's decision to resign as head coach and the resulting resignation of most of the Bonecrushers' staff. Kopac assumed the role of general manager for the Bonecrushers, and brought with him the core coaches of the Wolfpack outdoor team that would later become the core of the Wolfpack indoor team. Kopac led the team to its only win, a 51-46 victory of the Muskegon Thunder. With infrastructure already in place from the outdoor team, and following the previous year's experience with the Bonecrushers, Wolfpack management announced in early 2009 it would field both indoor and outdoor teams that year. To start the indoor team, Kopac coordinated with Lowe Entertainment, owners of the Rock River Raptors, also in the CIFL, to have Lowe run the indoor franchise while retaining Kopac as head coach. The Wolfpack were Madison's second indoor football franchise and the first to call Madison home since the Madison Mad Dogs folded in 2001. The Wolfpack played its inaugural season's home games at the Veterans Memorial Coliseum on the campus of the Alliant Energy Center and used AstroTurf previously belonging to the Pensacola Barracudas of AF2. In its inaugural season, the team finished 7-5 and qualified for the CIFL Playoffs, The team started 5-1 but struggled late in the season after former All-American UW-Platteville quarterback Tom Stetzer was lost to injury. The Wolfpack would fall to the eventual undefeated CIFL champion Chicago Slaughter in the 2009 CIFL Western Conference Championship Game, 63-19. For 2010, the Wolfpack chose to move its home games to the Hartmeyer Arena on the northeast side of Madison. 2010 also saw the team stock its roster with more players from the nearby Wisconsin Badgers football program. Joining defensive lineman Kurt Ware and linebacker James Kamoku from the 2009 Wolfpack would be tight end Andy Crooks, safety Josh Nettles, defensive lineman Ricky Garner, offensive lineman Kenny Jones and, following a season-ending injury to quarterback Brian Ryczkowski, Matt Schabert. Under Schabert's guidance, the Wolfpack had its most successful season to date, indoor or outdoor, finishing the regular season 8-2 and becoming the only team to defeat the then-undefeated Cincinnati Commandos. The Wolfpack would win its first-ever home playoff game, beating the Fort Wayne FireHawks, 25-24, before falling to the Commandos in the 2010 CIFL Championship Game, 54-40, in Cincinnati. == Season-by-season == == Outdoor Wolfpack == === Season-by-season === == Racine Raiders merger == After much speculation, the Racine Journal Times reported on December 9, 2010, that Jordan Kopac would return to coaching the Racine Raiders in 2011.

              " 'The Efficiency Medal (South Africa) was instituted in 1930 for award to part-time warrant officers, non-commissioned officers and men after twelve years of efficient service on the active list of the Citizen Force of the Union of South Africa. At the same time, a clasp was instituted for award to holders of the medal upon completion of further periods of six years of efficient service. The medal superseded the Colonial Auxiliary Forces Long Service Medal.The Efficiency Medal (South Africa) was superseded by the John Chard Medal in 1952. == Origin == In 1896, the Volunteer Long Service Medal for India and the Colonies was instituted by Queen Victoria. It was superseded by the Colonial Auxiliary Forces Long Service Medal in 1899. == Institution == The Efficiency Medal (South Africa) was instituted by Royal Warrant on 23 September 1930, as a long service award for part-time warrant officers, non-commissioned officers and men of the Citizen Force of the Union Defence Forces. At the same time, a clasp was instituted, for award to recipients of the medal upon completion of further periods of efficient service.The medal bears a subsidiary title to denote that the recipient qualified for its award while serving in the Citizen Force in South Africa. The subsidiary title, in English and Afrikaans, is inscribed on a scroll bar attached to the medal suspender.The similar award for officers was the Efficiency Decoration (South Africa). == Award criteria == The medal could be awarded to part-time warrant officers, non-commissioned officers and men after twelve years of continuous efficient service as a volunteer on the active list of the Citizen Force. Service in West Africa, natives of West Africa and periods spent on leave excluded, and war service were reckoned two-fold as qualifying service for the medal. Service during the period from 3 September 1939 to 1 March 1950 inclusive need not have been continuous, while breaks in service under certain specified conditions, though not counting as qualifying service, were not considered as a break in the twelve years of continuous qualifying service for the medal.Clasps could initially be awarded to holders of the medal upon completion of eighteen and twenty-four reckoned years of efficient service. This was amended on 26 August 1944 to authorise the award of additional clasps for each additional completed period of six years of efficient service after twenty-four years. When medals are not worn, recipients of clasps would wear a silver rosette on the ribbon bar to donate each clasp.A further amendment, on 10 May 1946, made part-time officers who served during the Second World War also eligible for the award of the medal and clasp, provided they were serving on the active list of the Citizen Force on 2 September 1939 and were embodied or called up for war service. The reason for this amendment originated from the anomaly that, during the war, a large number of officers were commissioned from the ranks, and merely by the fact that they were so promoted owing to their efficiency, would be denied the right to the Efficiency Medal. Such officers were allowed to reckon their service as officers as qualifying service for the medal and clasps. Officers who had already qualified for the award of the Efficiency Decoration before that date were, however, not eligible.The medal was initially only awarded to Citizen Force members of the South African Army and South African Air Force. On 1 August 1942, when the South African Navy was established by the consolidation of the Seaward Defence Force and the South African Division of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve into the South African Naval Forces, eligibility for the award of the medal was extended to South African Naval Citizen Force members. == Order of wear == In the order of wear prescribed by the British Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood, the Efficiency Medal (South Africa) ranks on par with the British Efficiency Medal and takes precedence after the Territorial Efficiency Medal and before the Special Reserve Long Service and Good Conduct Medal. === South Africa === With effect from 6 April 1952, when a new South African set of decorations and medals was instituted to replace the British awards used to date, the older British decorations and medals which were applicable to South Africa continued to be worn in the same order of precedence but, with the exception of the Victoria Cross, took precedence after all South African decorations and medals awarded to South Africans on or after that date. Of the official British medals which were applicable to South Africans, the Efficiency Medal (South Africa) takes precedence as shown. Preceded by the Efficiency Decoration (South Africa) (ED). Succeeded by the Decoration for Officers of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (VRD). == Description == The medal was struck in silver and is oval, 39 millimetres (1.54 inches) high and 32 millimetres (1.26 inches) wide. The fixed suspender bar, a pair of laurel leaves, is affixed to the medal by means of a single-toe claw and a horizontal pin through the upper edge of the medal. The suspender is decorated on the obverse with a scroll-pattern bar, inscribed with the name of the country. The name of the recipient was impressed on the rim of the medal. ObverseThree versions of the medal were produced for South Africa, but only the first two were awarded. The obverse has a raised rim on all three versions and bears the crowned effigy of the reigning monarch. The original version has the effigy of King George V in coronation robes and wearing the Tudor Crown. It is circumscribed \"GEORGIVS•V•D•G•BRITT•OMN REX•ET•INDIÆ•IMP•\". The initials \"BM\" at the bottom of the effigy are those of the designer of the obverse, Sir Bertram Mackennal KCVO, an Australian sculptor. The King George VI version was introduced after his succession to the throne in 1936 and has his effigy in coronation robes and wearing the Tudor Crown, facing left and circumscribed \"GEORGIVS•VI•D•G•BR•OMN•REX•ET•INDIÆ•IMP•\". It is identical to the first King George VI obverse design of the British Efficiency Medal. The initials \"PM\" below the effigy are those of the designer of the obverse, sculptor Percy Metcalfe CVO RDI. The Queen Elizabeth II version was introduced after her succession to the throne in 1952 and has her effigy, facing right and wearing the Tudor Crown. It is circumscribed \"ELIZABETH II D: G: BR: OMN: REGINA F: D:\" reading around from the top. It is identical to the first Queen Elizabeth II obverse design of the British Efficiency Medal.Scroll barApproved by a Royal Warrant dated 29 December 1939, the scroll bar inscription on the King George VI version of the medal was in English and Afrikaans, \"UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA\" and \"UNIE VAN SUID-AFRIKA\" in two lines. The scroll bar on the Queen Elizabeth II version was English only, but this medal was never awarded since it was superseded within a few months of the Queen\\'s succession to the throne. ReverseThe reverse is smooth with a raised rim and bears the inscription \"FOR EFFICIENT SERVICE\" in three lines. On the bilingual King George VI version, the Afrikaans and English inscriptions are \"VIR BEKWAME DIENS\" and \"FOR EFFICIENT SERVICE\", each language in three lines and the languages separated by a 13 millimetres long line. ClaspThe clasp, struck in silver, is decorated with an embossed Tudor Crown and was designed to be sewn onto the medal ribbon. RibbonThe ribbon is 32 millimetres wide and dark green, edged with 3 millimetres wide lime yellow bands. == Discontinuation == On 6 April 1952, the Efficiency Medal was superseded by the John Chard Medal, which could be awarded to all ranks after twelve years of continuous efficient service in the Citizen Force. == References ==',\n",
              " \"Physical media refers to the physical materials that are used to store or transmit information in data communications. These physical media are generally physical objects made of materials such as copper or glass. They can be touched and felt, and have physical properties such as weight and color. For a number of years, copper and glass were the only media used in computer networking. The term physical media can also be used to describe data storage media like records, cassettes, VHS, LaserDiscs, CDs, DVDs, and Blu-rays, especially when compared with modern streaming media or content that has been downloaded from the Internet onto a hard drive or other storage device as files. == Types of physical media == === Copper wire === Copper wire is currently the most commonly used type of physical media due to the abundance of copper in the world, as well as its ability to conduct electrical power. Copper is also one of the cheaper metals which makes it more feasible to use.Most copper wires used in data communications today have eight strands of copper, organized in unshielded twisted pairs, or UTP. The wires are twisted around one another because it reduces electrical interference from outside sources. In addition to UTP, some wires use shielded twisted pairs (STP), which reduce electrical interference even further. The way copper wires are twisted around one another also has an effect on data rates. Category 3 cable (Cat3), has three to four twists per foot and can support speeds of 10 Mbit/s. Category 5 cable (Cat5) is newer and has three to four twists per inch, which results in a maximum data rate of 100 Mbit/s. In addition, there are category 5e (Cat5e) cables which can support speeds of up to 1,000 Mbit/s, and more recently, category 6 cables (Cat6), which support data rates of up to 10,000 Mbit/s (i.e., 10 Gbit/s).On average, copper wire costs around $1 per foot. === Optical fiber === Optical fiber is a thin and flexible piece of fiber made of glass or plastic. Unlike copper wire, optical fiber is typically used for long-distance data communications, being that it allows for data transmission over far distances and can produce high transmission speeds. Optical fiber also does not require signal repeaters, which ends up reducing maintenance costs, since signal repeaters are known to fail often.There are two major types of optical fiber in use today. Multimode fiber is approximately 62.5 µm in diameter and utilizes light-emitting diodes to carry signals over a maximum distance of about 2 kilometers. Single mode fiber is approximately 10 µm in diameter and is capable of carrying signals over tens of miles.Like copper wire, optical fiber currently costs about $1 per foot. === Coaxial cables === Coaxial cables have two different layers surrounding a copper core. The inner most layer has an insulator. The next layer has a conducting shield. These are both covered by a plastic jacket. Coaxial cables are used for microwaves, televisions and computers. This was the second transmission medium to be introduced (often called coax), around the mid-1920s. In the center of a coaxial cable is a copper wire that acts as a conductor, where the information travels. The copper wire in coax is thicker than that in twisted-pair, and it is also unaffected by surrounding wires that contribute to electromagnetic interference, so it can provide higher transmission rates than the twisted-pair. The center conductor is surrounded by plastic insulation, which helps filter out extraneous interference. This insulation is covered by a return path, which is usually braided-copper shielding or aluminum foil type covering. Outer jackets form a protective covering for coax; the number and type of outer jackets depend on the intended use of the cable (e.g., whether the cable is supposed to be strung in the air or underground, whether rodent protection is required). The two most popular types of coaxial cabling are used with Ethernet networks. Thinnet is used on Ethernet 10BASE2 networks and is the thinner and more flexible of the two. Unlike a thicknet, it uses a Bayonet Niell-Concelman (BNC) on each end to connect to computers. Thinnet is part of the RG-58 family of cable with a maximum cable length of 185 meters and transmission speeds of 10 Mbit/s. Thicknet coaxial cabling is used with Ethernet 10BASE5 networks, has a maximum cable length of 500 meters and transmission speeds of 10 Mbit/s. It's expensive and not commonly used, though it was originally used to directly connect computers. The computer is connected to the transceiver at the cable from the attachment unit interface of its network card using a drop cable. Maximum thicknet nodes are 100 on a segment. One end of each cable is grounded. ==== Application ==== In the midst of the 1920s, coax was applied to telephone networks as inter-office trunks. Rather than adding more copper cable bundles with 1500 or 1000 pairs of copper wire and cable in them, it was possible to replace those big cables with much smaller coaxial cable. The next major use of coax in telecommunications occurred in the 1950s, when it was deployed as submarine cable to carry international traffic. It was then introduced into the data processing realm in the mid 1960s. Early computer architectures required coax as the media type from the terminal to the host. Local area networks were predominantly based on coax from 1980 to about 1987.Coax has also been used in cable TV and the local loop, in the form of HFC architecture. HFC brings fiber as close as possible to the neighborhood. Fiber terminates at the neighborhood node, where coax fans out to provide home service. ==== Advantages ==== Broadband system-coax has sufficient frequency range to support multiple channels, allowing greater throughput. Greater channel capacity - each of the multiple channels offers substantial capacity depending on the service location (6 MHz wide in North America, 8 MHz wide in Europe). Greater bandwidth - compared to twisted pairs, it has greater bandwidth for each channel. This allows it to support a mixed range of services (voice, data, video, multimedia). Lower error rates - the inner conductor serves as a Faraday shield that protects the network from electronic noise. ==== Disadvantages ==== The bus network on which coax is deployed is susceptible to congestion, noise and security risks. Great noise - the return path has some noise problems, and the end equipment requires added intelligence to take care of error control. High installation costs Susceptible to damage from lightning strikes - if lightning is conducted by a coaxial cable, it could very easily damage the equipment at the end of it. == Debate on physical media == With technology constantly changing, there is a debate on whether physical media is still prudent and necessary to an increasingly wireless world. Wireless and physical media may actually complement each other, and physical media will matter more, not less, in a society dominated by the wireless technology. However, other opinions consider physical media a dead technology that will eventually disappear. == References ==\",\n",

              " 'Donald Bradford Beary (4 December 1888 – 7 March 1966) was a vice admiral of the United States Navy. His career included service in both World War I and World War II and a tour as President of the Naval War College. He commanded a wide variety of ships and organizations, and is particularly noted for his leadership during World War II in establishing and directing a large-scale U.S. Navy training program and for his pioneering and highly successful work as a commander of U.S. Navy underway replenishment forces. == Naval career == Beary was born on 4 December 1888 in Helena, Montana. He entered the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, in 1906 and graduated in 1910. His first assignments were aboard three armored cruisers, USS Tennessee from 1910 to 1911, USS Washington from 1912 to 1914, and USS Maryland during 1914. He then attended Columbia University in New York, New York, from 1915 to 1917, and received a Master of Science degree in electrical engineering from the university in 1917. === World War I === After the United States entered World War I on 6 April 1917, Beary served in the Atlantic on convoy duty and in antisubmarine warfare against German submarines, commanding the armed yacht USS Remlik (SP-157) from 1917 to 1918 and then the destroyer USS Lamson in 1918. He received the Navy Cross in 1918 for distinguished service as commanding officer of Remlik and Lamson in the Atlantic campaign. === Interwar === A lieutenant commander by the end of World War I, Beary\\'s first post-war assignment was duty at the U.S. Navy Bureau of Navigation from 1919 to 1921. He then commanded three destroyers, USS Talbot (DD-114) in 1921, USS Parrott (DD-218) from 1921 to 1922, and USS Sumner (DD-333) from 1922 to 1923. From 1923 to 1924 he served ashore at the United States Department of the Navy in Washington, D.C., in the Division of Fleet Training, Navy Operations. He then returned to sea with duty aboard the battleship USS New Mexico (BB-40) from 1925 to 1927, seeing service in the Second Nicaraguan Campaign.From 1928 to 1930, Beary taught at the United States Naval Academy. He then served on the staff of the Commander-in-Chief, United States Asiatic Fleet, from 1931 to 1934, seeing service on the Yangtze Patrol. From 1934 to 1935, he was assigned to duty with the Chief of Naval Operations in Washington, D.C. He then served on the staff of the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1936.Beary went back to sea in 1937 as executive officer of the battleship USS Colorado (BB-45), serving aboard her until 1938, when he was promoted to captain. He then was commanding officer of the light cruiser USS Richmond (CL-9) from 1938 to 1939 before returning to duty at the United States Naval Academy, serving a second tour as an instructor there from 1939 until 1941. On 1 October 1941, he became commanding officer of both the troop transport USS Mount Vernon (AP-22) and Transport Division 19. === World War II === Mount Vernon was in the Atlantic Ocean as part of a convoy steaming from Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, bound for Cape Town, South Africa, when the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, brought the United States into World War II on 7 December 1941. She proceeded via the Cape of Good Hope and the Indian Ocean to Singapore, arriving there on 13 January 1942. In port until 16 January 1942, she landed desperately needed reinforcements and evacuated refugees despite frequent Japanese air raids, herself coming under air attack. She then operated in the Indian Ocean and Southwest Pacific until March 1942 to move additional reinforcements from the Middle East to Southeast Asia and evacuate refugees from Australia. Beary received the Bronze Star Medal in 1943 for meritorious achievement in these operations, and was especially cited for his conspicuous professional ability, leadership, and organization during Mount Vernon\\'s stay in Singapore. In July 1942, Beary became Commandant of Naval Operations Base Iceland. On 10 February 1943 he was promoted to rear admiral and took command of the United States Atlantic Fleet\\'s Fleet Operational Training Command, which organized and trained ships\\' crews, upon its establishment on 14 March 1943. As its commanding officer, he oversaw the creation and operation of a number of navy training establishments along the United States East Coast, at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and on Culebra Island off Puerto Rico, including a number of Anti-Aircraft Training Centers; the Anti-Aircraft Training Afloat Program aboard the antiaircraft training ship USS Wyoming (AG-17); the Combat Information Center Group Training Center in Norfolk, Virginia; the Anti-Submarine Warfare Unit in Norfolk; the Fleet Sonar School in Key West, Florida, and the Minecraft Training Center at Little Creek, Virginia. In all, he directed the training of more than a million officers and men and supervised the shakedown or refresher training of about 5,000 ships and craft. He received the Distinguished Service Medal in February 1945 for this service.On 1 October 1944, Beary took command of Service Squadron 6, a revolutionary new mobile underway replenishment element of the Service Force, United States Pacific Fleet, dedicated to support of the U.S. Third and Fifth Fleets in the Pacific. He proved particularly gifted in maintaining logistic support to the fleet despite the vast distances involved in the Pacific Theater and the complex and demanding task of keeping the fleets\\' combat forces supplied while underway for their frequent operations, including during the Battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa. His achievements in Service Squadron 6 were recognized by two awards of the Legion of Merit, both in 1945, for exceptional and meritorious conduct. During the ceremony in which Japan surrendered to the Allies on board the battleship USS Missouri (BB-63) on 2 September 1945 to end World War II, Beary served as a dignitary on the staff of United States Army General of the Army Douglas MacArthur. === Post-World War II === After World War II, Beary held various commands, serving as administrator of the U.S. Naval Shipping Control Authority; commandant of the 12th Naval District in 1946; commander of Naval Base San Francisco; commander of Western Sea Frontier; and commander of Pacific Reserve Fleet.On 1 November 1948, having reached the rank of vice admiral, Beary returned to the Naval War College as its president. During his presidency, he sought to broaden the views of students by bringing business authorities and leaders to meet with them in roundtable discussions, laying the groundwork for the college\\'s Global Strategy Discussions of the 1950s and Current Strategy Forum of today.Beary remained the war college\\'s president until 28 May 1950. He retired from the navy on 1 October 1950. == Personal life == Beary was married to Alice L. Beary (1889-1953). They had one daughter, Alice B. Beary Meschter (1920-2006).Beary was a decorated marksman and a member of the Navy Gun Club. == Death == Beary died on 7 March 1966 at the U.S. Naval Hospital in San Diego, California.

              " 'The South Staffordshire Railway (SSR) was authorised in 1847 to build a line from Dudley in the West Midlands of England through Walsall and Lichfield to a junction with the Midland Railway on the way to Burton upon Trent, with authorised share capital of £945,000. It was supported by the newly-formed London and North Western Railway (LNWR) and the Midland Railway, giving each company access to important areas. It completed its main line in 1849. As collieries in the Cannock region rose in importance, it built a second main line from Walsall to Rugeley, as well as numerous short spurs and connections to lines it intersected. Colliery working in the Cannock area expanded enormously, and mineral traffic carryings increased in step. In 1850 the entire company\\'s operation was leased to a private individual, John Robinson McClean, the first time this was ever done. His lease was successful, but the London and North Western Railway wanted control of the network for its own strategic purposes, and it manoeuvred to get the SSR shareholders to transfer the lease to the LNWR; in 1867 the LNWR acquired ownership of the SSR. Short distance passenger operation in the Walsall area was always buoyant, but in the post-1945 period a decline set in, and industrial retrenchment resulted in a gradual loss of goods and mineral business too. In 1965 a major round of passenger service closures was imposed, although the cessation of services on the Hednesford and Rugeley section was reversed from 1989. This Walsall to Rugeley service and a very short section at Lichfield are the only remaining passenger operations on the former SSR system == Early railways in Birmingham == Birmingham and the surrounding area acquired the epithet The Workshop of the World, supporting a huge range of diverse manufacturing industries. As the requirements of industrial customers became more advanced, it became a feature of Birmingham industry was that one manufacturer would make the basic part of a product, and for that piece to be transferred to another manufacturer for finishing. This resulted in a very large number of increasingly specialised makers, dependent on efficient local goods transport, over a widening local area. The first railways in Birmingham had their terminals on the then eastern margin of the city, around the Curzon Street station of the Grand Junction Railway and the London and Birmingham Railway; the Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway had a terminus at Lawley Street, a little further out. In the earliest days this was acceptable; the hilly nature of the centre of Birmingham would have been difficult for early railways to approach, and interchange, particularly between the L&BR and the GJR, were simplified by their proximity. As railway traffic developed, and it became clearer what the dominant traffic flows were, the limitations of this configuration became important, and led to a number of proposed changes. The earliest railways generally limited themselves to connecting pairs or small groups of major centres, but soon the benefit of amalgamations became apparent, so that larger companies serving larger areas began to develop. This led to the formation of (among others) two large groups with significant presences in Birmingham: the Midland Railway, formed on 10 May 1844, with a network from Leeds to Derby and Nottingham, and on to Rugby, and by leases to Gloucester and Bristol in 1845; andthe London and North Western Railway on 16 July 1846, connecting London, Manchester and Liverpool.In August 1845, the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway (OW&WR) was obtaining authorisation to build its line. This was a competitive threat to the established railways, but serious financial problems delayed the progress of the OW&WR. Eventually it became aligned with the Great Western Railway (GWR), but that remained in the future for the time being.As well as these organisational changes, practical difficulties were becoming important in handling traffic that did not start or end its journey in Birmingham, and the Curzon Street stations became a difficult obstruction to such traffic. The formation of the LNWR eliminated a competitive tension that had existed (between the London and Birmingham Railway and the Grand Junction Railway); at the same time the LNWR and the Midland Railway did not see themselves as direct competitors, so that a collaborative approach now seemed possible. == The core network == === Authorisation: Dudley, Walsall and northwards === Walsall and Dudley were important manufacturing towns, and it was to be expected that a railway connection between them would be put forward. The South Staffordshire Junction Railway was proposed to connect the two towns, with junction connections to the Grand Junction Railway, now to be part of the LNWR. The SSJR got its authorising Act of Parliament on 3 August 1846, with permitted share capital of £525,000. At the same time, another company, the Trent Valley, Midlands and Grand Junction Railway was authorised. It was to make a line from Walsall northwards through Lichfield to join the Midland Railway main line (heading towards Burton-on-Trent) at Wichnor. It too was authorised on 3 August 1846, with capital of £420,000. The two companies had been in discussion and saw there were advantages in combining, and this was allowed for in their respective Acts. Final agreement for this was accomplished on 6 October, ratified by an Act of 9 July 1847. The 1847 Act also confirmed a change of name for the combined company, which was to be called the South Staffordshire Railway; the combined share capital was fixed at £945,000; in addition the Act granted running powers over the Midland Railway from Wichnor Junction to Burton. === First construction: Walsall to Bescot === Although the Act of Parliament authorised the share capital, the Company had to obtain the share subscriptions, as well as acquire the necessary land. The Board decided on a modest start to construction, by building from Walsall to Bescot on the former Grand Junction Railway route. This was quickly accomplished, and the line was opened on 1 November 1847; temporary station premises were used at Walsall, south of Bridgeman Place, and the line connected to a junction on the GJR main line, called Bescot Junction. It is probable that the first trains were operated by the LNWR using their own rolling stock. There was no station at the junction. Prior to the opening of the Walsall line, there had been a station further north-west on the GJR line called \"Walsall\". It was now renamed Bescot Bridge, and it was used for journeys from Wolverhampton and further north to Walsall, by changing there to road transport. === Walsall to Wichnor === Of the main line sections originally authorised, there now remained the connection from Walsall to Wichnor Junction, joining the northward Midland Railway main line on the way to Burton: the length of this section was 17 miles. A construction contract was allocated on 17 May 1847. The work proceeded well enough, and on 1 March 1849 Captain Wynne of the Board of Trade inspected the line for passenger working. While much of the line was satisfactory, the junction connecting to the Midland Railway at Wichnor had not been installed. Wynne approved the line for passenger operation between Walsall and Lichfield, a distance of 10+1⁄2 miles. The company did not open that section at once, but waited until the remainder of the Wichnor route was ready. Wynne inspected the remainder of the line on 4 April 1849 and approved it, and it opened on 9 April 1849.However Boynton says: The date is often given as 9th April, but all that happened then was the running of a special for Directors, followed by a celebratory lunch at the George Hotel, Lichfield, attended by the mayor of the city and the High Sheriff of Staffordshire. Passenger services for ordinary mortals had to wait until 1st June. That day saw the opening 0f a permanent station at Walsall, on the present site... A South Staffs station at Lichfield Trent Valley opened in August, eleven months after one on the main Trent Valley line below. The Midland had running rights to Walsall and the LNWR had running rights through Wichnor Junction to Burton and Derby, capital of the Midland system. The temporary Walsall station was closed and the new permanent station, described by a newspaper as \"splendid\" was put into use. == South to Dudley == Now the Company extended its line southwards to Dudley, from a new junction off the Walsall to Bescot line, a distance of five miles. However the section of line presented to the Board of Trade inspecting officer for approval for passenger operation was not approved. Goods traffic (not needing that approval) started on 1 March 1850. On 1 May 1850 the line to Dudley was fully opened, the deficiencies having been rectified. This opening included an east-to-south spur enabling direct running from Bescot Junction to Dudley.The first Dudley station was a terminus north-east of Tipton Road; for a time the SSR Was the only railway with a presence in Dudley. In 1852 the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway opened its line as far as Dudley, and the South Staffordshire Railway opened a new station adjacent to the OW&WR station, but not connected to it. The OW&WR continued northwards the following year. The configuration of the two stations was still unsatisfactory, and an improved station connected to the OW&WR line platforms was opened in 1859. == Branches and spur connections == The core main line network of the SSR was thus completed. For some time it had been obvious that the original pattern of the earlier main lines was imperfect, and steps were taken to improve matters. In addition the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway was building its line, and the Great Western Railway too was taking steps to make a presence locally. The OW&WR and the GWR were later to align with one another under the GWR name, but for the time being they were far from friendly to one another. Moreover there was a rapid development in manufacturing industry in the area. There was a huge demand for transport of raw materials in and completed goods out, and factories were established in newly developed locations . Interconnection between railways of diverse ownership was essential in this environment, and the SSR\\'s position cutting across the grain of many main lines resulted in the construction of a number of junctions and spurs to enable transfer traffic. === Stour Valley line at Sedgeley === The Birmingham, Wolverhampton and Stour Valley Railway was opened in 1852. Usually referred to as the Stour Valley Line, it was an affiliate of the LNWR providing a more satisfactory route between Birmingham and Wolverhampton for that company. A new central station was being constructed in Birmingham, and as New Street station it opened fully in 1854. The Stour Valley line crossed over the Dudley to Walsall line of the South Staffordshire Railway at Dudley Port. The SSR Act of 1851 had authorised a short connecting line to the Stour Valley line with running powers into the LNWR High Level station, and gave the LNWR reciprocal running powers from there to Dudley. The connecting line was known as the Sedgeley Loop and it ran to a position alongside the new Stour Valley station and beyond it to form a junction with it. There was already a Low Level station at Dudley Port on the SSR main line, but the intention was to have a High Level station alongside the new Stour Valley station. However space at that point was extremely limited, as the Loop line was sandwiched between the Stour Valley line and the canal. Although the Sedgeley Loop and the connection to the Stour Valley line beyond were double track, the SSR station was built as a single line. The Board of Trade inspecting officer, Captain Galton, declined to allow opening of the section of line east of the station. The loop itself to the new SSR High Level station were acceptable, but the continuing through connection was not, apparently because of the perceived danger of working passenger trains from both east and west into the single line station. Use of the loop for trains terminating at Dudley Port started on 14 October 1853, but it was not until a connection was provided at the west end of the Stour Valley station, enabling the use of the BW&SVR platforms by through trains, that through running was permitted. This started on 2 January 1854, with a through passenger service between Dudley and Birmingham.In 1852 construction of the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway reached Dudley, and was continued to Tipton in 1853. The OW&WR was merged with other railways to form the West Midland Railway (WMR) in 1860 and in turn the WMR was absorbed into the Great Western Railway by Act of 1 August 1863.The opening of these portions of the OW&WR enabled through working by SSR trains from Kidderminster to Birmingham via the Sedgeley loop, but this service was operationally difficult and it was discontinued south of Dudley in 1867, with only two through New Street to Dudley services each way on weekdays. The connecting service for the short run from Dudley to Dudley Port prospered; it and the Walsall trains together were nicknamed \"The Dudley Dasher\". The Sedgeley loop service was eventually discontinued on 15 June 1964. === Birmingham, Wolverhampton and Dudley Railway === In 1846 another line between Birmingham and Wolverhampton had been authorised, on the same day as the original South Staffordshire Junction Railway: it was the Birmingham, Wolverhampton and Dudley Railway. It was nominally independent but very obviously aligned towards the Great Western Railway, which was to build towards Birmingham through the medium of another nominally independent company, the Birmingham and Oxford Junction Railway. The \"Dudley\" part of the BW&DR name represented a branch line that very closely duplicated most of the SSJR route. Although this had been authorised, the BW&DR agreed to leave the SSR (as it soon became) to build it, with running powers for BW&DR trains. There was a safeguard for the BW&DR if the SSR failed to build the line promptly. The BW&DR obtained an authorising Act in 1847 to sell its line to the Great Western Railway, and remarkably the Act authorised installation of mixed gauge (standard and broad gauge) track on the BW&DR. When the line opened in 1854 local passenger trains operated on the broad gauge. The SSR intersected and was crossed by the BW&DR at Wednesbury and a north-east to north-west connection was installed on 1 June, 1859, connecting the SSR to the BWDR route to Wolverhampton. It was laid with mixed gauge track, but the broad gauge rails were removed on 1 April 1869. The SSR had running powers over the BW&DR to Wolverhampton, although it is believed they were never exercised. === Wednesbury to Darlaston branch === An SSR Act of 23 July 1855 gave authorisation to build from Wednesbury SSR to Darlaston on the old GJR route. A single line opened on 14 September 1863 from the Darlaston former GJR station to Wednesbury. The Darlaston station was renamed James Bridge and a platform was provided on the Darlaston branch. The line was doubled on 22 December 1872. At first there was an intensive passenger service, of 56 daily trains; but the introduction of street-running trams practically wiped out the business and the passenger service was discontinued in 1887. The line was closed north of the Lloyds Works Siding at Fallings Heath on 24 December 1963; most of the rest of the line (except for a siding at the southern extremity) closed at the beginning of 1968. === Wednesbury – Princes End – Tipton branch === The 1855 Act also authorised a branch from Wednesbury to a triangular junction with the Stour Valley line at Tipton, penetrating a heavily industrialised area around Princes End. There was some delay in completing it, but it was opened on 14 September 1863. The south curve at Tipton to Tipton Station Junction was opened on 1 January 1883, and was not used for passenger traffic, except much later for diversionary purposes. A Walsall to Wolverhampton passenger service operated (to the northward curve) and its fate varied greatly, as there were better routes available for such a connection. The passenger services were withdrawn in 1916 as a wartime measure, and the line closed completely on 6 April 1981. === Leighs Wood colliery branch === A two-mile branch line was authorised in 1878, earlier (1855) powers having lapsed; it ran eastward from the SSR line near Pelsall to Leighs Wood colliery. The line opened on 14 November 1878, serving only a colliery and a brickworks; it closed in August 1965. === New Pleck curve === A west to north curve was provided at Pleck, connecting the old GJR route from Bushbury to the SSR route towards Walsall. It was authorised on 28 June 1877 and opened on 1 March 1881. On the same day the Portobello curve opened, connecting the GJR route into Wolverhampton LNWR station directly from the south-east for the first time. This enabled a Walsall to Wolverhampton passenger service. It was discontinued from 1964 but reinstated from 2000 with an hourly dmu service, but closed to passengers once again from 2008. == Control of the company == === Leasing the company === In 1849 with the main line only just completed, John Robinson McClean, the engineer to the SSR company, together with supporting business people, approached the SSR with an offer to lease the railway. The LNWR and MR were substantial shareholders and were opposed to the arrangement, fearing that the line would ally itself with competitors, but the majority of the shareholders considered that the offer was advantageous to them, and the idea was approved. The necessary powers were included in the SSR Leasing Act of 1850 The issued capital of the SSR was calculated as £669,375 and the rent charge was to be 2% of this in the first year, amounting to £13,387 10s., doubling after the first year and increasing to 5% after 14 years. The lease between McClean and the company became effective from 1 July 1850. No individual had ever been authorised by Parliament to lease a railway before, so this was a considerable precedent. After an initial period, McClean contracted train operation to the LNWR in 1852. === Relations with the Midland Railway === In 1853 James Allport became General Manager of the Midland Railway, and from that time relations between that company and the SSR became strained. Through running at Wichnor Junction was discontinued at Allport\\'s insistence, and exchange sidings had to be built there for handing over goods wagons. A \"Wichnor\" passenger station also had to be built, just inside SSR territory, for the exchange of engines on through passenger trains. SSR passengers heading for Derby had to change at Burton. Whatever Allport\\'s objective was, this pushed the SSR closer to the LNWR. === LNWR control === Towards the end of the 1850s the LNWR interests worked hard to make McClean\\'s lease unworkable; the LNWR clearly wanted to acquire the line. In 1858 McClean and the company agreed to discontinue the lease arrangement, and this was formally agreed on 21 January 1858. Negotiations to agree the financial implications of the disengagement were extremely protracted, and McClean\\'s lease terminated on 1 February 1860. He was compensated for the loss of profit for the residue of his lease; the sum was £110,099, which Boynton says, \"made an already wealthy man stupendously rich\".From that date the LNWR took over the lease. The Midland Railway had been a significant influence within the company from the outset, but now their involvement diminished. The LNWR lease was anticipated to be for 99 years. However, in common with many other railway leases, the advantages of outright control were compelling. Moreover the LNWR feared that the Midland Railway might get control of the line, establishing a significant presence in LNWR territory. The lease continued for a time, but arrangements were made to transfer the SSR company to LNWR ownership. The transfer was ratified by the LNWR (New Works and Additional Powers) Act of 15 July 1867.The SSR network was now part of the LNWR, although there were running powers protections retained for the Midland Railway. This was a double edged sword, for it gave the LNWR, as owner of the SSR network, running powers over the Midland Railway into Burton. This was an attractive benefit, of which the LNWR intended to take full advantage.The LNWR sent a goods train to exercise the running powers to Derby via Wichnor Junction. The train found the line blocked at the junction. Neele wrote, Arriving at Wichnor Junction I was surprised to see a large number of platelayers, about, two or three engines in steam, and a saloon carriage in the siding. One of the engines with steam up had attached to its tender the V crossing of the junction over which we had to pass to get to Burton... Mr Needham [the superintendent of the Midland], who had bivouacked all night in the saloon, refused to allow the LNW train to pass. On asking Mr Needham for what purpose the force of Midland men was requisitioned, he told me that it was reported that the London and North Western were coming down with a body of 300 men and three engines intending to force their way into Burton, and that it had been determined to resist. Instructions came to me by telegraph: once more at the appointed time in the afternoon, a passage must be claimed. Some wiser counsels had prevailed at Derby, for when the time came, the opposing force had disappeared, and we made a triumphal journey towards Burton. == Cannock lines == === Reaching Cannock === In the SSR Act of 1847 there were powers to build from Walsall to Cannock, which was becoming an important centre of extractive industry. The SSR did not progress this work at the time, but got an extension of time in 1854. In addition a three mile branch line was now authorised from near Pelsall on the SSR Lichfield line, to Norton Canes. Although the engineering of the line was relatively simple, there was a problem over the lack of a turntable at the Cannock terminus that resulted in a delay to the opening of the line, until 31 January 1858. The Norton Canes branch opened on the same day. === Cannock Mineral Railway === A prospective railway company called the Derbyshire, Staffordshire and Worcestershire Junction Railway had tried to get Parliamentary authority to build from Uttoxeter to Dudley, connecting Manchester in to its network as well by means of running powers. It had been rebuffed, but in the 1847 session a more modest scheme was authorised, from the North Staffordshire Railway at Uttoxeter to Cannock, making an end-on connection with the (proposed) SSR line there. Several years passed without much progress, largely due to failure to generate share subscriptions, and attempts to bring one of the large railway companies on board as a financial sponsor were also fruitless. A further reduction in scope was necessary, and the title of the Cannock Mineral Railway (CMR) was adopted. Further prevarication followed until in June 1857 the LNWR appeared as guarantor. The line was finally built, between Cannock and Rugeley only, opening on 2 November 1859; it was worked by the LNWR. === Norton branch === A colliery line was opened on 1 February 1858 from Norton Junction to Norton Crossing Junction, a distance of 2+3⁄4 miles. === Cannock Chase Railway === The Cannock Chase Railway was authorised in 1860 to provide a link between the Cannock Mineral Railway and the Marquis of Anglesey\\'s colliery interests. It ran east from Hednesford to Rawnsley, with a spur to Heathy Leasows to connect with the Littleworth Tramway. The Cannock Chase Railway was opened on 7 October 1862, and was worked by the collieries themselves. === Norton branch extension railway === A continuation of the Norton branch from Norton Crossing Junction opened on 25 April 1879. The line continued to East Cannock Junction on the Walsall to Rugeley line, forming a through route. == Grouping and nationalisation, and afterwards == In 1923 the London and North Western Railway was incorporated within the new London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), as part of a process known as the \"Grouping\" of the railways, following the Railways Act 1921. By this time the distinct character of the former South Staffordshire Railway was waning. In 1948 the railways were once again reorganised, following the Transport Act, 1947, which resulted in the LMS being taken into national ownership as part of British Railways. Following the end of World War II there was a steep decline in the use of local passenger trains, and of wagonload goods services, and British Railways accumulated huge losses. While some small-scale closures had taken place in the 1950s, by the following decade it was plain that the situation needed to be managed. === Passenger service withdrawals === There was a nationwide wave of withdrawal of unremunerative passenger services during the 1960s. The former Western Region (ex-GWR) services from Birmingham Snow Hill to Dudley were withdrawn on 15 June 1964, and the Walsall to Dudley line closed to passengers on 6 July 1964; Dudley station was therefore closed. The following year a large-scale passenger closure took place on 18 January 1965: from Walsall to Wichnor Junction via Lichfield; from Walsall to Water Orton via Sutton Park; from Walsall to Wolverhampton via Pleck; and Walsall to Rugeley. This left passenger operation on only the short section from Walsall to Bescot Junction, and a short length at Lichfield. === Electrification === In the mid 1960s an extensive electrification programme was undertaken involving main line routes through Birmingham and elsewhere. As part of the work, the short section from Bescot to Walsall was electrified, from 15 August 1966.The Hednesford and Cannock line was not opened to passenger trains until later, but in 2014 it was announced that the line between Walsall and Rugeley was to be electrified, with a completion date of 2017.Lichfield City and the short link on the former SSR route to Lichfield Trent Valley were served by the Cross-City line passenger services from 1978 and 1988 respectively. On 6 June 1993 the Cross-City services, and this short former SSR section, were electrified. === Rugeley passenger services === Passing through an area which after World War II was subject to industrial decline, usage of the passenger trains on the Cannock and Rugeley line declined steeply, and the passenger service had been discontinued from 18 January 1965. All the intermediate stations between Walsall and Rugeley Trent Valley were closed to passengers. The Walsall Area Passenger Group made strenuous efforts during 1974 to get the line reopened to passengers. A reconstructed and modernised station was opened at Walsall in 1980, giving impetus to the idea. The group were successful, and passenger services were reinstated between Walsall and Hednesford on 10 April 1989. The line north of Hednesford had been reclassified operationally as a goods line, and re-equipping it for passenger operation was stated to be excessively costly. However in November 1993 it was announced that the line would be reopened to passengers, but then the necessary work was greatly delayed and the services did not begin until March 1997. There were 13 trains each way daily. === Dudley Freightliner Terminal === As passenger use ceased, it was considered that Dudley station would be a good location for a freightliner terminal, particularly as the rail connectivity was good. It was opened on 6 November 1967. However the facility lasted only 21 years and was closed on 17 April 1988. === Cannock mineral traffic === Although coalmining in the Cannock area had declined substantially in the post-war period, there were still several operational collieries in 1965. These declined, but changing activity by the coal and electricity generating industries resulted in novel traffic flows. Nevertheless in the late 1970s substantial closure had taken place, and even a new opencast location at Essington Wood closed in 1992. Rugeley \\'B\\' power station opened in 1970. == Incidents == On 22 December 1859 one passenger jumped from a Walsall to Birmingham train near Perry Barr railway station and was killed, and others were injured, due to the train, using South Staffordshire Railway rolling stock, being derailed by one of its carriages shedding a tyre. == The present day == At present (2022) heavy rail passenger operation takes place from Bescot (now named Bescot Stadium) to Walsall; and on to Rugeley; and from Lichfield City Station to Lichfield Trent Valley. The line from Lichfield Trent Valley to Wichnor Junction has (2022) only one regular passenger service, the 08:11 Leeds to Plymouth, but it is used from time to time by trains between Burton and Birmingham when engineering works or other causes make the route through Kingsbury unavailable. == Locations == === Dudley – Walsall – Wichnor route === Dudley; temporary station, opened 4 May 1850; extended to permanent station after a few months; closed 6 July 1964; Sedgeley Junction; divergence to Dudley Port High Level; Dudley Port; opened 1 May 1850; closed 6 July 1964; Great Bridge North; opened 1 May 1850; renamed Great Bridge North 1 July 1950; closed 6 July 1964; Wednesbury; opened 1 May 1850; renamed Wednesbury Town 13 June 1960; closed 6 July 1964; Bescot Curve Junction; divergence to Aston; Pleck Junction; convergence from Aston; Walsall; temporary station opened 1 November 1847; replaced by permanent station 9 April 1849; still open; Ryecroft Junction; divergence to Cannock linel Rushall; opened 24 March 1856; closed 1 March 1909; Pelsall; opened 9 April 1849; closed 18 January 1965; Brownhills; opened 9 April 1849; renamed Brownhills High Street 2 June 1924; renamed Brownhills 1 August 1930; closed 18 January 1965; Hammerwich; opened June 1849 ;closed 18 January 1965; Lichfield City; opened 9 April 1849; renamed Lichfield City 1871; relocated 3 November 1884; still open; Lichfield Trent Valley Junction; 9 April 1849; replaced by Lichfield Trent Valley High Level 3 July 1871; closed 18 January 1965; reopened 28 November 1988; still open; Brookhay; opened 9 April 1849; closed December 1849; Alrewas; opened 9 April 1849; closed 18 January 1965; Wichnor Junction (station); opened 2 April 1855; closed 1 November 1877; Wichnor Junction; convergence with Midland Railway main line. === Cannock and Rugeley route === Walsall; above; Ryecroft Junction; above; Birchills; opened February 1858; closed 1 January 1916; Bloxwich; opened 1 February 1858; closed 18 January 1965; reopened 17 April 1989; still open; Bloxwich North; opened 2 October 1990; still open; Landywood; opened 2 March 1908; closed 1 January 1916; Wyrley and Church Bridge; opened 1 February 1858; renamed Wyrley and Cheslyn Hay 1 December 1912; closed 18 January 1965; Cannock; opened 1 February 1858; closed 18 January 1965; reopened 10 April 1989; still open; Hednesford; opened 7 November 1859; closed 18 January 1965; reopened 10 April 1989; still open; Brindley Heath; opened 3 August 1939 and 17 August 1939 for RAF families; fully open 26 August 1939; closed 6 April 1959; Rugeley Town; opened 1 June 1870; closed 18 January 1965; reopened 2 June 1997; still open; Rugeley Trent Valley; opened 15 September 1847; still open. == Notes == == References ==',\n",

              " 'Józef Kępiński ([juzɛf kɛ̃piɲski]; 12 September 1900 – 26 March 1964) was a Polish aviator and officer of the Polish Air Force and the Royal Air Force during World War II. Among other posts he was a commanding officer of the 111th Fighter Escadrille in Poland and the I/145 Polish Fighter Squadron in France, as well as the Air Training Centre. == Before World War II == He was born in Stryków near Łódź. Józef Kępiński joined the renascent Polish Army on 1 November 1918. Together with the 1st Chevau-léger Regiment he took part in the Polish-Ukrainian War. Withdrawn from the front for training he returned to front-line service with the rank of podporucznik, in time to take part in the Polish-Bolshevist War of 1920. After the armistice and the Peace of Riga he remained in the army and in 1926 he volunteered for the Polish Air Force. He trained as a fighter pilot in various escadrilles and eventually joined the 121 Fighter Escadrille (later renamed the 111th) flying Spad 61 fighters.An excellent and decorated pilot, in 1932 he became the commanding officer of his escadrille and the following year was promoted to the rank of captain. In 1936 he became the commanding officer of the IV Fighter Squadron (comprising 113th and 114th Fighter Escadrilles). Promoted to the rank of major, in 1937 Kępiński was dispatched to Dęblin, where he headed the Air Training Centre (Polish: Centrum Wyszkolenia Lotnictwa), the predecessor to Polish Air Force Academy. == World War II == After the start of the Invasion of Poland he headed an ad-hoc air defence of Dęblin. Ordered to evacuate from Poland after the Soviet invasion, he fled to Romania. Interned, he managed to escape and reach France, where he joined the Polish Air Forces in France and Great Britain. Dispatched to Lyon-Bron, he became the first commanding officer of the I/145 Polish Fighter Squadron.During the Battle of France, despite flying the obsolete Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 and Caudron C.714 fighters, the Polish unit under Kępiński\\'s command achieved 11 victories in the first three days of the Battle of France. However, on 10 June 1940 Kępiński led his unit against a German bombing raid south of Dreux, covered by approximately 12 Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters. Blinded by the sun, Kępiński became separated from his unit and mistook the enemy formation for his own. Heavily wounded, with his lung shot through, he managed to crash-land his damaged airplane at Dreux airfield. He spent the remainder of the campaign in hospitals in Chartres and Vichy. In October 1940, he escaped from Vichy France, passing through Spain and Portugal to reach Great Britain. Unable to serve as a fighter pilot due to his earlier wounds, he served on various rear-area posts for the rest of World War II flying Percival Proctor, Miles Master and Airspeed Oxford planes. He eventually rose to the Polish rank of lieutenant colonel (podpułkownik) and the British rank of group captain. == After World War II == After the war he returned to Communist-held Poland and continued his military service. Forced to retire in 1949, during the Stalinist repressions against pre-war Polish officers, he was placed on a proscription list and spent the remainder of his life doing menial jobs and working as an ordinary worker in Warsaw. He died 26 March 1964 in Warsaw and was buried at the Powązki Military Cemetery. == References == === Citations === === Bibliography === Wojciech Zmyślony (2009). \"Józef Kępiński\".

              " 'Information cards are personal digital identities that people can use online, and the key component of an identity metasystem. Visually, each i-card has a card-shaped picture and a card name associated with it that enable people to organize their digital identities and to easily select one they want to use for any given interaction. The information card metaphor is implemented by identity selectors like Windows CardSpace, DigitalMe or Higgins Identity Selector. An identity metasystem is an interoperable architecture for digital identity that enables people to have and employ a collection of digital identities based on multiple underlying technologies, implementations, and providers. Using this approach, customers can continue to use their existing identity infrastructure investments, choose the identity technology that works best for them, and more easily migrate from old technologies to new technologies without sacrificing interoperability with others. The identity metasystem is based upon the principles in \"The Laws of Identity\". == Overview == There are three participants in digital identity interactions using information cards: Identity providers issue digital identities for you. For example, businesses might issue identities to their customers, governments might vouch for the identities of their citizens, credit card issuers might provide identities enabling payment, online services could provide verified data such as age, and individuals might use self-issued identities to log onto websites. Relying parties (RPs) accept identities for you. Online services that you use can accept digital identities that you choose and use the information provided by them on your behalf, with your consent. Subject is yourself, the party in control of all these interactions. The subject can choose which of its applicable digital identities to use with the relying party. === Selectors === An identity selector is used to store, manage, and use their digital identities. Examples of identity selectors are Microsoft\\'s Windows CardSpace, the Bandit Project\\'s DigitalMe, and several kinds of Identity Selectors from the Eclipse Foundation\\'s Higgins project. An identity selector performs the following user-centric identity management tasks: Provides a consistent user experience for authentication (and in some cases other kinds of interactions) with an RP (also known as a Service Provider). Provides a user interface that displays a set of information card icons from which the user selects their preferred i-card when authentication is required by a local application or relying party (e.g. a website\\'s login page). Provides a user interface to create and manage personal (also known as self-issued) information cards. Provides a local security token service that is used to issue the security tokens for personal i-cards. Provides a user interface to import and export information cards in standard file formats. Is invoked by a browser extension or by a local rich client application.An identity selector may also allow the user to manage (e.g. create, review, update, and delete cards within) their portfolio of i-cards. === Identity metasystems === There are five key components to an identity metasystem: A way to represent identities using claims. Claims are carried in security tokens, as per WS-Security. A means for identity providers, relying parties, and subjects to negotiate. Dynamically negotiating the claims to be delivered and the security token format used enables the identity metasystem to carry any format of token and any kinds of claims needed for a digital identity interaction. Negotiation occurs using WS-SecurityPolicy statements exchanged using WS-MetadataExchange. An encapsulating protocol to obtain claims and requirements. The WS-Trust and WS-Federation protocols are used to carry requests for security tokens and responses containing those tokens. A means to bridge technology and organizational boundaries using claims transformation. Security token services (STS) as defined in WS-Trust are used to transform claim contents and formats. A consistent user experience across multiple contexts, technologies, and operators. This is achieved via identity selector client software such as Windows CardSpace representing digital identities owned by users as visual i-cards. === Generic qualities === I-cards are created by an entity known as a issuer. I-cards display the name of the issuer (issuerName) in a text string. I-cards have a text string to identify the card (cardName) that is initially set by the card issuer. Typically this card name is user-editable. I-cards may have a (GIF or JPEG) background image (cardImage) set by the card issuer (user-editable). In most i-cards the user is able to see the value of the claims. == Sign-in capabilities == Using i-cards, users can authenticate without needing a username and password for every website; instead, at sites accepting them, they can log in with an i-card, which may be used at multiple sites. Each information card utilizes a distinct pair-wise digital key for every realm where a key is requested. A realm may be a single site or a set of related sites all sharing the same target scope information when requesting an information card. The use of distinct pair-wise keys per realm means that even if a person is tricked into logging into an imposter site with an i-card, a different key would be used at that site than the site that the imposter was trying to impersonate; no shared secret is released. Furthermore, many identity selectors provide a means of phishing detection, where the HTTPS certificate of the relying party site is checked and compared against a list of the sites at which the user has previously used an information card. When a new site is visited, the user is informed that they have not previously used a card there. == Types of i-cards == The Identity Selector Interoperability Profile v 1.5 (or OASIS IMI v1.0 Committee Draft) specifies two types of information cards that an identity selector must support. Personal Information Cards: (Also called self-issued) these cards allow you to issue claims about yourself to sites willing to accept them. These claims can include your name, address, phone numbers, e-mail address, web address, birth date, gender, and a site-specific key uniquely generated for each site where the card is used. Managed Information Cards: These cards allow identity providers other than yourself to make claims about you to sites willing to accept them. These claims can include any information that an RP requests, an identity provider is able to provide, and you are willing to send between them.The Higgins project is defining two new kinds of i-cards as well: Relationship cards (or R-cards) are used to establish an ongoing relationship between multiple parties. Zero-knowledge cards (or Z-cards)However the Information Card format allows for custom types; The Bandit project demonstrated prototype managed cards backed by OpenIDs at the Novell BrainShare conference in March 2007. === Personal cards === The first kind of personal Information cards were also introduced as part of Microsoft’s Windows CardSpace software in November 2006. Their behavior is also defined by the same documents covering the Microsoft-defined managed cards (see above). Summary of characteristics: Data format an XML file containing: set of claim type URIs as well as the (user-defined) values of these claims, cardImage, a unique cardID, etc. This data format is defined in the ISIP documents. Issuer: The user\\'s own Identity Selector. Personal cards can be described as self-issued Genesis: Created by the user\\'s Identity Selector. Claims: 15 pre-defined claim types (e.g. firstname, surname, email address, etc.) are defined in the Identity Selector Interoperability Profile v 1.5 (or OASIS IMI v1.0 Committee Draft). Authority: The user\\'s Identity Selector is the authority for the issued token\\'s set of claim values. Data flow: On demand (e.g. as needed by a relying site), an STS local to the Identity Selector creates a security token with the current values. Editability: The claim values are directly editable by the user. Attribute data source: The personal card XML file contains claim values. When imported into an Identity Selector these data values are then managed internally by the selector. === Managed information cards === The first kind of managed card was introduced as part of Microsoft’s Windows CardSpace software in November 2006. The behavior, file format and interoperability characteristics of these kinds of managed cards are defined by Microsoft documents such as the Identity Selector Interoperability Profile v 1.5 (or OASIS IMI v1.0 Committee Draft; see self-issued.info for a more complete list), in combination with open standards including WS-Trust and others. Summary of characteristics: Data format: an XML file containing: network endpoint of the STS, set of claim type URIs, name of the card, cardImage, issuerName, a unique cardID, etc. The XML file format is defined in the ISIP documents. Issuer: An external, third party token service (representing an external person or organization). Genesis: A managed card is generated by a Security Token Service running at an Identity Provider site and imported into the user\\'s Identity Selector. Claims: The list of supported claim types (claim type URIs) is defined by the issuer. Authority: The issuer is the sole authority for the claim values contained within the token it issues. Data flow: Managed cards contain a network endpoint reference to an STS that, when requested by the Identity Selector (using WS-Trust, etc.) generates/provides a security token containing the required claims. Editability: Underlying attribute data is not directly editable by the user. Attribute data source: Determined by the issuer, and generally managed by the issuer.I-cards issued by third parties can employ any of four methods for the user to authenticate himself as the card owner: a Personal Information Card (self-issued), an X.509 certificate (which can either be from a hardware device such as a SmartCard or it can be a software certificate), a Kerberos ticket, such as those issued by many enterprise login solutions, or a username and password for the card.Additional methods could also be implemented by future identity selectors and identity providers. Managed i-cards can be auditing, non-auditing, or auditing-optional: Auditing cards require the identity of the RP site to be disclosed to the Identity Provider. This can be used to restrict which sites the identity provider is willing to release information to. Non-auditing cards will not disclose the identity of the RP site to the Identity Provider. Auditing-optional cards will disclose the identity of the Relying Party site if provided by the RP, but do not require this disclosure. === Relationship cards === Relationship cards are under development by the Higgins project (see the report by Paul Trevithick).Summary of characteristics: Data format: A managed card that supports a resource-udi claim. Supported Claims: Like all managed (or personal) cards, r-cards include a list of supported claim types (expressed as URIs) as defined by the issuer. This set defines the maximal set of claims that issuer will include in its generated security token. These claims are inherited from underlying ISIP-m-card upon which it is based and are used for the same purposes. Beyond managed cards the resource-udi \"meta\" claim provides a reference to a set of attributes. Authority: The issuer is the authority for the issued token\\'s set of claim values (as per a normal managed or personal card). Editability: The values of underlying attributes (referenced by the resource-udi claim) may be editable by parties other than the issuer. Supported Attributes: The value of an r-card\\'s resource-udi claim is an Entity UDI (URI) that \"points to\" a data entity (representing a person, organization, or other object). The set of attributes of this data entity is distinct from (though usually a superset of) the \"supported claims\" mentioned above. ==== Reliance on the Higgins Data Model ==== Conceptually a managed card is essentially a human-friendly \"pointer\" to a Token Service—a web service (e.g. a STS) from which security tokens can be requested. A security token is a set of attribute assertions (aka claims) about some party that is cryptographically signed by the issuer (the token service acting as the authority). An r-card, contains a second \"pointer\" that points to a data entity whose attribute\\'s values (i) shared by all parties to the r-card and (ii) form the underlying attributes that are consumed by the r-card issuer\\'s STS and provide the values of the claims that this STS makes. By including this second \"pointer\" on the r-card, r-card holders have the potential to access and update some subset of these underlying attributes. The card issuer maintains an access control policy to control who has what level of access. This second pointer is an Entity UDI—a reference to an Entity object in the Higgins Context Data Model. Entity UDIs may be dereferenced and the underlying Entity\\'s attributes accessed by using the Higgins project\\'s Identity Attribute Service. Once resolved, consumers of this service can inspect, and potentially modify the attributes of the entity as well as get its schema as described in Web Ontology Language (OWL). In addition to basic identity attribute values like strings and numbers, the data entity referred to by an r-card can have complex attribute values consisting of aggregates of basic attribute types as well as UDI links to other entities. == Claims == Beyond being used to log into sites, Information Cards can also facilitate other kinds of interactions. The Information Card model provides great flexibility because cards can be used to convey any information from an Identity Provider to a Relying Party that makes sense to both of them and that the person is willing to release. The data elements carried in i-cards are called Claims. One possible use of claims is online age verification, with Identity Providers providing proof-of-age cards, and RPs accepting them for purposes such as online wine sales; other attributes could be verified as well. Another is online payment, where merchants could accept online payment cards from payment issuers, containing only the minimal information needed to facilitate payment. Role statements carried by claims can be used for access control decisions by Relying Parties. == Interoperability and licensing == The protocols needed to build Identity Metasystem components can be used by anyone for any purpose with no licensing cost and interoperable implementations can be built using only publicly available documentation. Patent promises have been issued by Microsoft, IBM, and others ensuring that the protocols underlying the Identity Metasystem can be freely used by all. The Information Cards defined by the Identity Selector Interoperability Profile v 1.5 (or OASIS IMI v1.0 Committee Draft) are based on open, interoperable communication standards. Interoperable i-card components have been built by dozens of companies and projects for platforms including Windows, Mac OS, and Linux, plus a prototype implementation for phones. Together, these components implement an interoperable Identity Metasystem. Information Cards can be used to provide identities both for Web sites and Web Services applications. Several interoperability testing events for i-cards have been sponsored by OSIS and the Burton Group, one was at the Interop at the October 2007 European Catalyst Conference in Barcelona and the most recent was at RSA 2008. These events are helping to ensure that the different Information Card software components being built by the numerous participants in the Identity Metasystem work well together. The protocols needed to build Information Card implementations based on the Identity Selector Interoperability Profile v 1.5 (or OASIS IMI v1.0 Committee Draft) can be used by anyone for any purpose at no cost and interoperable implementations can be built using only publicly available documentation. Patent promises have been issued by Microsoft, IBM, and others, ensuring that this Information Card technology is freely available to all. In June 2008, industry leaders including Equifax, Google, Microsoft, Novell, Oracle, PayPal and others created the Information Card Foundation in order to advance the use of the Information Card metaphor as a key component of an open, interoperable, royalty-free, user-centric identity layer spanning both the enterprise and the Internet. In his report on the Interop at the June 2007 Catalyst Conference in San Francisco, analyst Bob Blakley wrote: The interop event was a milestone in the maturation of user-centric identity technology. Prior to the event, there were some specifications, one commercial product, and a number of open-source projects. After the event, it can accurately be said that there is a running Identity Metasystem. == History of the terminology == The term \"information card\" was introduced by Microsoft in May 2005 as a name for the visual information card metaphor to be introduced in its forthcoming Windows CardSpace software. Until early 2006, information cards were also sometimes referred to by the code-name “InfoCard”, which was not a name that was freely available for all to use. The name information card was specifically chosen as one that would be freely available for all to use, independent of any product or implementation. The name “information card” is not trademarked and is so generic as to not be trademarkable. The term i-card was introduced at the June 21, 2006, Berkman/MIT Identity Mashup conference. The intent was to define a term that was not associated with any industry TM or other IP or artifact. At the time, Microsoft had not yet finished applying the Open Specification Promise to the protocols underlying Windows CardSpace and there was also a misunderstanding that the term information card was not freely available for use by all, so to be conservative, the term i-card was introduced. Mike Jones, of Microsoft, explained to participants of a session at IIW 2007b that Microsoft always intended the term information card to be used generically to describe all kinds of information cards and to be freely usable by all, and tried to correct the earlier misunderstanding that the term might apply only to the kinds of information cards originally defined by Microsoft. He made the case that the industry would be better served by having everyone use the common term information card, than having two terms in use with the same meaning, since there remains no legal or technical reason for different terms. In this case the term i-card would become just the short form of information card, just like e-mail has become the short form of electronic mail. == Software implementations == DACS – open source RP & Information Card STS written in C.

              " 'The PC 1715 was an office computer produced by VEB Robotron in East Germany starting in 1985. The system featured an 8-bit microprocessor, the U880, a clone of the Zilog Z80. It was built for office work and education, but was also put to some specialist uses, for example an optional interface was available for controlling a pacemaker. The 1715 had minimal graphics and sound capabilities. The price was 19,000 East German marks. In contrast to the A5120 predecessor, the PC1715 was not built around the K1520 bus standard. There was no back plane, but the main board had 2 58-pin connectors that were largely K1520 compliant, with some signals omitted and replaced with custom internal signals. The floppy controller of the PC1715 used one of those internal bus extensions and was built with discrete components and logic chips, whereas other robotron computers of the 1980s used a clone of an Intel 8272 Floppy disk controller. The floppy controller board clearly appears to be based on the one used in the A5120. The graphics subsystem on the other hand was part of the main board circuitry and relied on a Intel 8275 compatible CRT controller with a portion of main memory used as video memory. A second U880 processor was used in the keyboard, together with a small firmware ROM to decode the keyboard matrix and transmit the keycode via a serial link to the main board. Though it was common practice at the time for processors that failed normal quality tests to be reused with much reduced clock frequencies and this may have been the case here. In 1987, a new version was produced, the PC 1715W (1715M in the Soviet Union). The system was identical to the PC 1715, except the processor was clocked at 4 MHz and the machine had 256KiB DRAM. In total, about 93,000 PC 1715 and PC 1715W units were manufactured. An estimated 50,000 of those were exported to the Soviet Union. In March 1987, a stamp was issued by the German Democratic Republic featuring the PC 1715. 8 million copies were printed. == Images == == See also == History of computer hardware in Eastern Bloc countries == References ==',\n",

              " 'The 2012–13 San Diego Sockers season was the fourth season of the San Diego Sockers professional indoor soccer club as a franchise in the Professional Arena Soccer League. The Sockers, a Pacific Division team, played their home games in the Valley View Casino Center in San Diego, California. General manager John Kentera and head coach Phil Salvagio led the Sockers to the best regular season record in the PASL and their fourth consecutive league championship. == Season summary == The Sockers were very successful in the regular season, finishing 15–1 and clinching the Western Division title for the fourth consecutive season. They began the season with a 37-game win streak, one of the best in professional sports history, and the last three PASL league championships. The team\\'s win over Toros Mexico on November 23, 2012, gave the Sockers the new United States record for consecutive wins by a professional soccer team. The team remained undefeated at home but the streak was snapped after 48 games by a 6–5 overtime road loss to longtime rival Dallas Sidekicks on January 27, 2013.San Diego also performed well at the box office, placing second in the league (behind only Dallas) in overage home attendance. The team advanced to the postseason and earned the right to play for the Ron Newman Cup in the PASL National Championship. The Sockers defeated the Turlock Express in two straight games, winning the Pacific Divisional Finals and advancing to the Semi-Finals in San Diego where they defeated the Las Vegas Legends in overtime. The team defeated the Detroit Waza 8–6 in regulation for the league championship on March 11, 2013. The Sockers also participated in the 2012–13 United States Open Cup for Arena Soccer. They defeated the Arizona Storm in the Wild Card round, the Anaheim Bolts in the Round of 16, the Turlock Express in the Quarter-Finals, and the Las Vegas Legends in the Semi-Finals before losing 6–7 to the Detroit Waza in the Championship game on March 2, 2013. == History == This is the third franchise to bear the \"San Diego Sockers\" name. The original Sockers were founded in 1978 and played in the NASL, original MISL, and the CISL before folding in 1996. The second Sockers were revived for the WISL in 2001 and transitioned to the second MISL in 2002 before folding in 2004.The current Sockers franchise was founded in 2009 and played its first three seasons at the Chevrolet Del Mar Arena in Del Mar, California. For the 2012–13 season, the Sockers returned to the former San Diego Sports Arena (now the Valley View Casino Center) which hosted the indoor games of both of the previous Sockers franchises. == Off-field moves == The majority of San Diego Sockers games were broadcast live on XEPE-AM (1700 AM, \"ESPN Radio 1700\") with Craig Elsten on play-by-play plus sideline reporter Tim Strombel at home games. (The Ron Newman Cup league championship game aired on XEPRS-AM, \"The Mighty 1090\".) The same team presented every regular season match as streaming audio on the Sockers\\' official website and their audio accompanied the video of America One Sports webcasts of Sockers games. 2012–13 is Elsten\\'s fourth seasons the voice of the Sockers. == Roster moves == In October 2012, the team re-signed veteran forward Paul Wright for the 2012-13 season. Wright\\'s 25-year professional soccer career began with the San Diego Nomads and continued with the Cleveland Crunch, the original San Diego Sockers, the Milwaukee Wave, the Los Angeles Salsa, the Baltimore Blast, the Wichita Wings, the Sacramento Knights, the Kansas City Wizards, the Western Mass Pioneers, the Philadelphia KiXX, the second San Diego Sockers, the San Diego Fusion, the Anaheim Bolts, and a previous stint with the current San Diego Sockers. == Awards and honors == The San Diego Hall of Champions honors athletes with ties to the San Diego area each month by selecting its Stars of the Month. For November 2012, this list included Sockers forward Miguel \"Chiky\" Luna. For December 2012, the honorees included Sockers top-scorer Kraig Chiles. In January 2013, the Hall announced that Kraig Chiles was one of 15 area athletes selected as a 2012 Star of the Year. For January 2013, the honorees included high-scoring midfielder Brian Farber. For February 2013, the hall honored team captain Aaron Susi.On November 27, 2012, citing his eight goals in the Sockers\\' match against Toros Mexico, the Professional Arena Soccer League named Kraig Chiles, the league\\'s leading scorer and its reigning Most Valuable Player, as their Player of the Week. On December 25, 2012, the PASL named Sockers team captain Aaron Susi as their Player of the Week. The league cited the veteran\\'s 2 goals and 3 assists in his team\\'s victory over the Anaheim Bolts on December 22 as well as his 25 total points to date this season.The team honored former Sockers player and coach Brian Quinn with a halftime ceremony during the January 5, 2013, game against the Turlock Express. Quinn played for the original Sockers franchise from 1983 to 1991 and later served as coach of both the original and first revival versions of the team. On January 2, 2013, the San Diego Hall of Champions announced that Quinn would be inducted into its Breitbard Hall of Fame on February 25, 2013, as part of the Class of 2013.On January 22, 2013, the league cited his game-winning goal in the Sockers defeat of the Las Vegas Legends in naming Brian Farber as the PASL\\'s Player of the Week. Farber scored two goals and two assists with the final score coming just 2.2 seconds before the end of regulation. It gave San Diego their first lead of the match and the win, preserving their record-setting winning streak and clinching the Pacific Division title for the team.On February 5, 2013, the PASL named Kraig Chiles as its player of the week for the second time this season. The league cited his offensive performance against the Anaheim Bolts the previous weekend where he set a new regular season goal scoring record, breaking his own make from last season.On February 12, 2013, the league named Kraig Chiles as its player of the week for the second week in a row and third time this season. Chiles broke the league points record held by Bernie Lilavois since the 2008–09 season. He also became the first player in PASL history to score 50 goals in a single season.In postseason honors, forwards Kraig Chiles and Brian Farber were named to the 2012-13 PASL All-League First Team. Forward Aaron Susi was named to the 2012-13 PASL All-League Second Team and Chiles was also named the 2012-13 PASL Most Valuable Player. == Schedule == Win Tie Loss === Regular season === † Game also counts for US Open Cup, as listed in chart below. === Postseason === === 2012–13 US Open Cup for Arena Soccer === == References == == External links == San Diego Sockers official website ESPN Radio 1700 official website',\n",

              " 'A private road is a road owned or controlled by a private person, persons or corporation rather than a road open to the public and owned by a government. Private roads can be on private land or can be constructed on government land for use by government agencies or by agreements for access to private facilities. Private roads are private property and are not usually open to the public. Unauthorized use of a private road may be trespassing. In some cases, the owner of a private road may permit the general public to use the road. Road regulations that apply to a public road may not apply to private roads. Common types of private roads include roads retained in subdivisions of land but not dedicated to the public, residential roads maintained by a homeowners association, housing co-operative or other group of homeowners and roads for access to an industrial facilities such as forests, mines, power stations and telecommunications. == By country == There are also networks of private highways in Italy and other nations. Such highways typically are toll roads whose upkeep is paid for with user fees, for example, the Dulles Greenway in Virginia, United States. England and Wales are thought to have about 40,000 private roads. They are not normally the responsibility of the local authority, but the authority may provide services such as street lighting. They normally have to be maintained by residents. They are referred to as unadopted roads because they have not gone through the statutory process of adoption, for example under Highways Act 1980 s37 or s38. Even if not expressly or implicitly dedicated for public use, public use over time may nonetheless have created public rights of way; though by Part 6 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006, in force from 2 May 2006, many public rights of way for motor vehicles in private roads have now been extinguished. In Sweden, private road associations manage two thirds of the total road network. However, only four per cent of the total road transportation work is carried on them, mostly rural roads. In fact, only one per cent of the road transports are made on the half of the roads that do not receive government subsidies for their maintenance, with the bulk not receiving subsidies being built and maintained by the forestry industry as needed and most often closed to the public. New private roads that receive government support are often built by the government and transferred to the roads principal stakeholders, those living along it. These form a private road association to maintain it and get subsidies from the government to keep it open to the rest of the public. Even after factoring in the unpaid work of the members of the association, the cost of operation and maintenance is often considerably less than a comparable public road. Finland is similar, with 280,000 km of private roads and only 78,000 km of public roads.In Canada private roads are main access routes or private driveways onto private property. These roads are typically maintained by private owners of the land they occupy. Some private roads are maintained by a municipality and are open to the public. Many private roads do not have any name signage other than a sign indicating the ownership status; however, in some cities private roads are given conventional street names through the municipal addressing system. One notable private road, the Sultan Industrial Road in Northern Ontario, is 80 kilometres long and forms part of the only existing route between two major provincial highways; it is thus under a public access agreement permitting its use by the public, and nearly half of all traffic on the road in a 2016 study consisted of passenger vehicles rather than company trucks.In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, all roads of higher categories are public by law. Just the lowest category can be private. This category is called \"účelová komunikace\" (\"účelová komunikácia\" in Slovak), the adjective \"účelový\" can be translated as \"purpose-built\", special-purpose\" or \"utilitarian\". The road law distinguish \"publicly accessible\" and \"closed\" (in a closed area) special-purpose roads. This category includes roads that are used exclusively to connect a private structure or plots to the road network, but also field and forest roads, areas such as car parks, public transport terminals, roads within industrial, military, hospital or school premises and areas etc. Private roads outside closed areas are largely subject to public law and public traffic on them can be restricted only with the consent of state authorities (public accessibility of the landscape is also protected by law). In most cases, they are not distinguished from municipal or regional roads by any signs. == See also == Free-market road (concept of libertarian philosophies, specially anarcho-capitalism and minarchism) Private highway Private highways in the United States Dirt road == References ==',\n",
              " \"The Nashville Sounds Minor League Baseball team has played in Nashville, Tennessee, since being established in 1978 as an expansion team of the Double-A Southern League. They moved up to Triple-A in 1985 as members of the American Association before joining the Pacific Coast League in 1998. With the restructuring of the minor leagues in 2021, they were placed in the Triple-A East, which became the International League in 2022. The first game of the new baseball season for a team is played on Opening Day, and being named the Opening Day starting pitcher is an honor which is given to the player who is expected to lead the pitching staff that season, though there are various strategic reasons why a team's best pitcher might not start on Opening Day. The Sounds have used 41 different Opening Day starters in their 45 seasons.Nashville's first Opening Day game was played against the Memphis Chicks at Tim McCarver Stadium in Memphis, Tennessee, on April 15, 1978. Bill Dawley was their starting pitcher that day; he took the decision in a game the Sounds lost, 4–2. Their first Opening Day game held at home was an 8–7 win against the Birmingham Barons at Herschel Greer Stadium on April 9, 1981. Starter Jamie Werly, who went on to win the Southern League Most Outstanding Pitcher Award that season, did not figure in the decision.On April 4, 2013, starter Tyler Thornburg took a no decision in the final Opening Day game at Greer Stadium, a 5–4 Sounds win. The team left Greer after the 2014 season, but did not play their first Opening Day game at First Horizon Park, their new facility then known as First Tennessee Park, until two years later. In that game, held on April 7, 2016, Sounds starting pitcher Chris Smith was charged with the loss in a 5–0 shutout by the Oklahoma City Dodgers. The 2020 Opening Day game, scheduled to be played at First Horizon Park on April 9, was postponed and ultimately cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Nashville's Opening Day starting pitchers have a combined Opening Day record of 11 wins, 15 losses, and 18 no decisions. At Greer Stadium, they had a record of 5 wins, 4 losses, and 8 no decisions in 17 Opening Day starts. At First Horizon Park, they have 0 wins, 2 losses, and 1 no decision in 3 Opening Day starts. They have an aggregate record of 5 wins, 6 losses, and 9 no decisions in 20 Opening Day starts at home. Nashville starters have a record of 6 wins, 9 losses, and 9 no decisions in 24 Opening Day starts on the road. The only Sounds pitchers with more than one Opening Day start are Bill Dawley (1978 and 1979), Rodney Imes (1990 and 1991), and Zach Jackson (2007 and 2008), each with two starts. Three Sounds Opening Day starters have also started Opening Day games in Major League Baseball: Bob Milacki for the Baltimore Orioles in 1990, Wily Peralta for the Milwaukee Brewers in 2016, and Chris Bassitt for the Oakland Athletics in 2021. == Pitchers == == References ==\",\n",

The theatre is named after Lawrence Batley, a local entrepreneur and philanthropist, who founded a nationwide cash and carry chain. The building was originally built in 1819 as a Methodist chapel, called the Queen Street Chapel. The architect is unknown but the chief mason was Joseph Kaye, the man who was also responsible for Huddersfield station. It was opened on 9 July 1819 and the reporter in the Leeds Mercury described it as \"one of the most handsome and commodious chapels in the kingdom; being capable of accommodating 3000 persons, and has been erected at an expense of from 8 to £10,000\". The chapel became a mission in 1906 until a decline in numbers saw the mission move out of the building in 1970 to a new building in King Street. In 1973 the building was converted into an arts centre. However serious structural problems were discovered by Kirklees Metropolitan Council in 1975 and the Arts Centre was rehoused into Venn Street Arts Centre and the building remained vacant before being sublet to Novosquash Limited and converted to a squash club known as The Ridings. It also housed a restaurant and a The Catacombs Disco. In 1989 the Kirklees Theatre Trust was given the go ahead to save the building from deterioration and launch Huddersfield\\'s newest theatre. Building work for the theatre started in September 1992 and took 4 years to complete. == Notable events == GNUF- a Grand Northern Ukulele Festival Shakespeare Schools Festival == See also == Listed buildings in Huddersfield (Newsome Ward - central area) == References == == External links == Lawrence Batley Theatre Website',\n",

              " 'Birger Joseph Nordholm (June 25, 1897 – November 30, 1989), was a Swedish-American founding director of the Swedish National Tourist Office in New York City, and the first Chairman of the European Travel Commission. == Biography == Birger Nordholm was born in 1897 in Stockholm, Sweden, and grew up in Östermalm where he studied at Östra Real. \"Peace and understanding through travel.\" Birger Nordholm devoted his career to the promotion of tourism and international relations between Sweden, the United States and Europe. During Nordholm\\'s lifetime, tourism in Sweden expanded into one of the nation\\'s main revenue source, and Nordholm was a keen promoter of its transatlantic development. Nordholm initiated and headed the Swedish National Tourist Office 1921–1963, located in the Rockefeller Center in New York City, United States. He went on to serve as Managing Director for the Swedish State Railways Travel Information Agency as well as the Swedish-American Chamber of Commerce in New York City, and was a lifelong member of the Scandinavian Travel Commission.After World War II, as part of the Marshall Plan, Nordholm was appointed the initial Chairman (1949–1958) of the European Travel Commission by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. In addition, he was appointed President of the Conference of European Railroad Representatives. \"The ETC has come to be definitely recognised as the coordinating agency for all these interests and as such is able to attract other European travel advertising and promotion to support its own efforts and thereby present a vastly larger sales story to the American public than is possible with ETC funds alone.\" Following the simplification of visa regulations, customs procedures, and other formalities, as expressed in a 1952 edition of the This Week magazine, Birger Nordholm together with Arthur Haulot foregrounded the \"purposeful\" and \"educational\" dimension of \"a new type of tourism\" that would be \"the foundation of lasting peace\". This would eventually contribute to the development of the OECD Tourism Committee.Nordholm\\'s residences in New York City and Weston, Connecticut, would become centers of international festivities, including annual Midsummer celebrations held at his country house \"Tuckaway\", attended by ambassadors, consular heads, the press, Miss Sweden and other dignitaries, as well as friends and neighbours, and Nordholm became a well-known international speaker.He died in 1989 in Raleigh, Wake County, North Carolina, United States, with ashes buried at his country house \"Tuckaway\" in Connecticut. == Charities == Birger Nordholm promoted philanthropy to various international charities, such as to the humanitarian aid organization Finnish Relief Fund with purpose to assist civilians of Finland during the Winter War of World War II. He assisted cultural institutions such as the American Museum of Natural History, and was a member of the Swedish Pioneer Historical Society, and the American Swedish Historical Foundation behind the American Swedish Historical Museum.Nordholm was also a \"Founding Father\" and \"skålleage\" of the North American charter of the Skål International in New York City on 1 April 1938, with the objective to \"develop true friendship and common purpose among members of the tourist industry; through tourism, to promote mutual understanding and foster goodwill between the peoples of the world.\"The Birger Nordholm Foundation (Swedish: Birger Nordholms stiftelse) was posthumously established at his former secondary school Östra Real in Östermalm, Stockholm.

              " 'The Eel is an alias used by two fictional characters appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The first character to take up the identity was Leopold Stryke who first appeared in Strange Tales #112 (October 1963) created by Stan Lee and Dick Ayers, while his successor, Edward Lavell, first appeared in Power Man and Iron Fist #92 (April 1983). Both Eels were at one point members of the Serpent Squad even though the character they portray was not actually based on a snake, but on a fish that resembled a snake. Neither Eel has ever been featured as a regular character in any of Marvel\\'s ongoing or limited series. The original Eel, Leopold Stryke, wore a suit that could generate an electrical charge like an electric eel and was coated with a slippery substance. He was often depicted as a henchman, normally teaming up with other criminals such as Plantman, Porcupine, Scarecrow and Unicorn. He later became a founding member of the Serpent Squad along with his brother Jordan, the original Viper. He even worked for Madame Hydra, unaware that she had killed his brother. Stryke was killed by the Gladiator during a heist. The second Eel, Edward Lavell, started out as a foe of Power Man and Iron Fist, but later became a general henchman like the original Eel working for Justine Hammer\\'s Masters of Evil and the Maggia. At one point Lavall appeared to have been killed, but later appeared as part of the latest incarnation of the Serpent Squad led by Sin, the daughter of the Red Skull. Subsequently, the Eel became part of \"Serpent Solutions\", the next incarnation of the Serpent Society. == Publication history == The original Eel first appeared in Strange Tales #112 (September 1963), and was created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko. The character subsequently appears in Strange Tales #117 (February 1964), Daredevil #6 (February 1965), Fantastic Four Annual #3 (1965), X-Men #22-23 (July–August 1966), Captain America #158-159 (February–March 1973), #163 (July 1973), #180-181 (December 1974-January 1975), Defenders #36-38 (June–August 1976), and Ghost Rider #21-22 (December 1976-January 1977), in which he died. The character appeared posthumously in Alpha Flight Special Edition #1 (June 1992), Untold Tales of Spider-Man #11 (July 1996), and Marvel: Heroes and Legends #1 (October 1996). The original Eel received an entry in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition #17, and in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #2. The second Eel first appeared in Power Man and Iron Fist #92 (April 1983) and was created by Kurt Busiek and Denys Cowan. == Fictional character biography == === Leopold Stryke === Leopold Stryke was the first criminal known as the Eel. In Stryke\\'s first appearances, he battled the Human Torch when he stole a nuclear device. Stryke was also a teammate of Plantman, the original Porcupine, the Scarecrow and the original Unicorn when they worked as henchmen for Count Nefaria. He was dispatched to battle the original team of X-Men. He then served as a henchman of the original Mister Fear, along with the Ox, as part of the Fellowship of Fear.Leopold and his brother Jordan, who was the original Viper, were later members of the original Serpent Squad. This first lineup battled Captain America. Leopold also aided the Serpent Squad in a plot to raise the continent of Lemuria. They battled the original Nomad and Namor the Sub-Mariner. When Madame Hydra reorganized the second Serpent Squad, Leopold remained unaware that she had murdered his brother and taken his alias. Leopold Stryke is fatally mutilated in Las Vegas by the Gladiator, who was sent to acquire a disintegrator ray that the Eel had in his possession. === Edward Lavell === Edward Lavell is first seen attempting to break Hammerhead out of prison. He battles Power Man and Iron Fist. Later working with Nightshade, the Eel is defeated again by Iron Fist and reformed criminals Discus and Stiletto.The Eel is seen working with the criminals Blitz and the Vanisher. The trio is defeated by Spider-Man. Lavell also aids a group of villains attacking the Fantastic Four.In hopes of gaining revenge against the criminal Mister Hyde, the Eel arranged a murder of a woman he had befriended, framing Hyde. Lavell also secretly impersonated \"Snake\" Marston, joining his team, the Enforcers, and led them in throwing off Daredevil’s attempts to find the true killer. Ultimately, the Eel sucker-punched Daredevil and gloated of his plans, but the Enforcers overheard and turned on him. The Eel was taken into court to clear Hyde’s name and was remanded to custody.Lavell was a member of Justine Hammer\\'s Masters of Evil, and is defeated by the Thunderbolts. After the Masters of Evil are apprehended, he was seen among the Maggia leaders assembled by the Grim Reaper who tried to claim leadership of the scattered, fractious families on behalf of Count Nefaria. He was captured when the Avengers invaded the meeting place. The Eel once worked against Hammerhead, transporting the Lifeline Tablet on behalf of Caesar Cicero, although Hammerhead soon recovered the Tablet for his own purposes.Lavell was next seen participating in the Bloodsport tournament at Madripoor. There, he put on a poor showing. He is defeated by the Toad, who seemingly crushes Lavell using his extremely long and powerful tongue.Lavell apparently survives the fight and is briefly seen as a client for the law firm Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg & Holliway. He is discussing action to be taken against Power Man and refers to an \\'Eel-Mobile\\'.Lavell plays a small role in the \"Secret War\" crossover event.During the Civil War storyline, the Eel is apprehended by the Thunderbolts to serve in the so-called Thunderbolt Army.Following the disbanding of the Thunderbolt Army, the Eel was among the villains at Stilt-Man\\'s funeral at the Bar with No Name at which Punisher poisoned the drinks and then blew up the bar.Lavell turned up as a member of a new Serpent Squad led by Sin, the daughter of the Red Skull. He participates in several murderous missions, including one intended to damage the Asian stock markets. He breaks Crossbones out of jail and later attacked the White House, but he was stopped by the new Captain America.During the Original Sin storyline, the Eel is relaxing in his lounge alongside his goons when he receives an unexpected visit from the Black Cat. The Eel taunts her with the fallout from her capture by the Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus\\' mind in Spider-Man\\'s body) and then attacks her. The Black Cat retaliates revealing her companion, Electro, who attacks the Eel\\'s goons while the Black Cat taunts the Eel saying that she will take everything from him. Mister Negative and Phil Urich (who is now leading the remnants of the Goblin Underground as the self-proclaimed Goblin King) are waiting for the Eel in order to divide the criminal underground after Norman Osborn\\'s downfall, but they are stunned by seeing the Eel crashing into the place when the Black Cat comes into view.As part of the All-New, All-Different Marvel event, the Eel appears as a member of the Viper\\'s Serpent Society under its new name of Serpent Solutions. == Powers and abilities == Leopold Stryke designed the original Eel costume, which consisted of electrically superconducting fabric sandwiched in between body insulation and a layer of near-frictionless synthetic fabric. The Eel costume featured small devices capable of generating large and small bursts of electricity. It could fire electrical bolts (initially only through his suit\\'s chest protector) and give off bright glows, as well as set up an electric current in the costume that would shock anyone touching it. The costume was coated with a greasy silicon substance (which was sometimes asbestos grease) that made it slippery. The costume could operate underwater. The battle suit also projects an electrical field which allows him to sense his surroundings, even in total darkness. The Eel used various weapons, including a specially designed helicopter, an Aqua-Attractor gun, and an Eel-Cannon. == References == == External links == Eel (Leopold Stryke) at Marvel.com Eel (Edward Lavell) Eel (Leopold Styke) at MarvelDirectory.com Eel (Leopold Stryke) at The Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe Eel (Edward Lavell) at The Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe Eel (Leopold Stryke) at Marvel Wiki Eel (Edward Lavell) at Marvel.com',\n",

              " 'The Osteiner Hof (\"Court of Ostein\") is one of several Baroque-era palatial mansions along Schillerplatz square in the German city of Mainz. The mansion, along the southern edge of the square, was built in 1747-1752 by architect-soldier Johann Valentin Thomann for Franz Wolfgang Damian von Ostein, brother of Johann Friedrich Karl von Ostein, who was prince-bishop of Mainz at that time. Characteristic features for this building are the three round protrusions (risalits) at the front entrance and on the two corners. The building is lavishly decorated; for instance, the windows are framed by rococo-style cartouches symbolising the elements of air, earth and water. The classical gods Diana and Mars are shown on the cartouches framing the balcony doors. The von Osteins, a dynasty of counts, were not able to make use of the mansion for very long. After the left bank of the Rhine was occupied by French Revolutionary armies, the mansion was appropriated by the state, and in 1798 it became the seat of a newly created département of France, Mont-Tonnerre. The building continued to be used as a seat of government after the Napoleonic era, even gaining the nickname Gouvernement during the years 1854-1859, while emperor-to-be Wilhelm I was serving as military governor of Mainz. During the early days of the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871), the Osteiner Hof served as military headquarters of a Prussian field marshal, Prince Frederick Charles of Prussia. In 1914, then-military governor General Hugo von Kathen announced the start of World War I to the Mainz populace from the balcony of the Osteiner Hof. The mansion was destroyed by fire during World War II, but was restored in 1947-1948. From 1958 until 2014, the Osteiner Hof was in use by the Bundeswehr as military headquarters and officers\\' mess. The Osteiner Hof plays an important part in the local carnival traditions. Every year, on 11 November at 11 past 11, the start of the carnival season is proclaimed from the balcony of the mansion. == Sources == Landeshauptstadt Mainz: Historisches Mainz: Der Osteiner Hof (German)',\n",

It is notable for the presence of one of General Wade's military roads, built at the time of the Jacobite risings in the eighteenth century. == Military road == This pass would be relatively obscure were it not for General Wade's military road built over it in 1731, between Fort Augustus in the Great Glen to the north and Melgarve in Strath Spey in the south. This path almost became the site of a major battle in the Jacobite rising of 1745, when Prince Charles Edward Stuart encamped at the height of the pass, and the Government commander approached from the south to quell the rebellion. The Government forces retreated due to the strongly entrenched position of the Jacobite Forces. == The pass today == The Highland Council states that the Corrieyairack Pass is not maintained as a public road, and is not suitable for use as one, so it advises against using motor vehicles on the pass. The road surface is made of stone, though it is now very eroded and damaged, and in many places the original paving has been lost. It is now used primarily by hikers and mountain bikers, as well as access for workers maintaining the adjacent electricity pylon line.

              " 'The Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909 or Bangkok Treaty of 1909 was a treaty between the United Kingdom and the Kingdom of Siam signed on 10 March 1909, in Bangkok.Ratifications were exchanged in London on 9 July 1909, and the treaty established the modern Malaysia–Thailand border. The area around modern Pattani, Narathiwat, southernmost Songkhla, Satun, and Yala remained under Thai control, where decades later the South Thailand insurgency would erupt. Thailand relinquished its claims to sovereignty over Kedah (Thai: ไทรบุรี, romanized: Saiburi), Kelantan (กลันตัน, Kalantan), Perlis (ปะลิส, Palit) and Terengganu (ตรังกานู, Trangkanu) which entered the British sphere of influence as protectorates. These four states, along with Johor, later became known as the Unfederated Malay States. == Background == The Kingdom of Siam was controlled by the monarch. Although there were many previous monarchs, those most responsible for maintaining Siam\\'s independence begins with Rama I (r.1782-1809). Unlike previous rulers, Rama I was a technocratic ruler who consulted with social elites on political matters and Sangha (Buddhist monks) on religious matters. His consultations with the Siamese elites became de rigueur for his successors.: 94 Rama I was succeeded by Rama II (r.1809-1824). Rama II\\'s greatest accomplishment was the establishment of a government of ministers. Near the end of his reign, in 1820, the British came on the scene seeking control of Penang. Rama II was followed by Rama III (r.1824-1851). He granted concessions to the British in exchange for their support. The same would be done later with the French.: 95 In 1826, in an effort to establish independence, Rama III and British officials signed the Burney Treaty. The treaty affirmed British assent that Kedah, Perlis, Terengganu, and Patani were Thai provinces while Penang and Province Wellesley belonged to the British and that the Siamese would permit British trade in Kelantan and Terengganu. After Rama III\\'s reign, a succession crisis brought Mongkut (r.1851-1868) to power. Under Mongkut\\'s leadership the Bowring Treaty of 1855 was signed. It provided British subjects in Siam with extraterritoriality, meaning that Britons would have British laws applied to them rather than Siamese. Mongkut constantly made concessions to the British and French to maintain independence in Siam until, in 1868, he was succeeded by Chulalongkorn, who ruled from 1868 to 1910. Chulalongkorn was a moderniser, similar to his predecessors. He abolished slavery, centralised revenues, created a national educational system, and safeguarded Siamese independence. == Treaty == The Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909, signed under the leadership of Chulalongkorn, consists of eight articles. In return for the four provinces Siam ceded in the treaty, extraterritorial protections for most Asian subjects of Britain were removed, and the Siamese government received a loan at 4 percent interest from the Federated Malay States to build a railway in southern Siam. === Article 1 === \"The Siamese government transfers to the British government all rights of suzerainty, protection, administration and control whatsoever which they possess over the states of Kelantan, Tringganu, Kedah, Perlis, and adjacent islands. The frontiers of these territories are defined by the boundary protocol annexed hereto.\" === Article 2 === The transfer provided for in the preceding article shall take place within thirty days after the ratification of this treaty. === Article 3 === A mixed commission, composed of Siamese and British officials and officers, shall be appointed within six months after the date of ratification of this treaty and shall be charged with the delimitation of the new frontier. The work of the commission shall be commenced as soon as the season permits, and shall be carried out in accordance with the boundary protocol annexed hereto. Subjects of his majesty the king of Siam residing within the territory described in article 1 who desire to preserve their Siamese nationality will, during the period of six months after the ratification of the present treaty, be allowed to do so if they become domiciled in the Siamese dominions. His Britannic majesty\\'s government under take that they shall be at liberty to retain their immovable property within the territory described in article 1. It is understood that in accordance with the usual custom where a change of suzerainty takes place, any concessions within the territories described in article 1 hereof to individuals or companies, granted by or with the approval of the Siamese government, and recognised by them as still in force on the date of the signature of the treaty, will be recognised by the government of his Britannic majesty. === Article 4 === His Britannic majesty\\'s government undertake that the government of the Federated Malay States shall assume the indebtedness to the Siamese government of the territories described in article 1. === Article 5 === The jurisdiction of the Siamese International Courts, established by article 8 of the treaty of 3 September 1883, shall, under the conditions defined in the jurisdiction protocol annexed hereto, be extended to all British subjects in Siam registered at the British consulates before the date of the present treaty. This system shall come to an end, and the jurisdiction of the International Courts shall be transferred to the ordinary Siamese courts after the promulgation and the coming into force of the Siamese codes, namely, the penal code, the civil and commercial codes, the codes of procedure, and the law for organisation of courts. All other British subjects in Siam shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the ordinary Siamese courts under the conditions defined in the jurisdiction protocol. === Article 6 === British subjects shall enjoy throughout the whole extent of Siam the rights and privileges enjoyed by the natives of the country, notably the right of property the right of residence and travel. They and their property shall be subject to all taxes and services, but these shall not be other or higher than the taxes and services which are or maybe imposed by law on Siamese subjects. It is particularly understood that the limitation in the agreement of 20 September 1900, by which the taxation of land shall not exceed that on similar land in Lower Burmah, is hereby removed. British subjects in Siam shall be exempt from all military service, either in the army or navy, and from all forced loans or military exactions or contributions. === Article 7 === The provisions of all treaties, agreements, and conventions between Great Britain and Siam, not modified by the present treaty remain in full force. === Article 8 === The present treaty shall be ratified within four months from its date. In witness where of the respective plenipotentiaries have signed the present treaty and affixed their seals. Done at Bangkok, in duplicate, the 10th day of March, in the year 1909.\" == See also == Si Rat Malai == Notes ==',\n",

              " 'The Vale of Belvoir ( (listen) BEE-vər) covers adjacent areas of Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire, England. The name derives from the Norman-French for \"beautiful view\" and dates back to Norman times. == Extent and geology == The vale is a tract of low ground rising east-north-east, with a somewhat ill-defined area. Its vale-like form can be viewed from either its south-east to eastern flank (the Belvoir \"ridge\") or from the north-west along the A46 (Roman Fosse Way) from which it is less conspicuous. It is the product of geological processes, being occupied in the main by the sedimentary mudstones and thin limestones of the Liassic (Lias), with a northern fringe from the upper parts of the Triassic (Mercia Mudstone and Rhaetic). The south-eastern margin is the most clearly defined because it is formed by a conspicuous scarp slope, on which Belvoir Castle sits about 330 feet (100 m) above the valley floor. Its resistance to erosion is due to a capping of relatively thick Jurassic Ironstone. The vale-like form is further constrained by cappings of ancient glacial till that form the higher ground along its western margin. In the Pliocene epoch (1.7 million years ago) the Vale of Belvoir was occupied by the \"Proto-Trent\" River, which cut a gap through the limestone ridge at Ancaster and then flowed on to the North Sea. At the end of the Wolstonian Stage (c. 130,000 years ago) a mass of stagnant ice left in the Vale of Belvoir caused the river to divert north along the old Lincoln river, through the Lincoln gap. == Settlements == === Nottinghamshire === === Leicestershire === === Lincolnshire === The relatively populous places in or beside the Vale of Belvoir include Bingham, Cotgrave, Keyworth and Bottesford. == Attractions == Belvoir Castle, which occupies a dominant position overlooking the vale, is the ancestral home of the family of the Dukes of Rutland. The castle saw significant damage in both the Wars of the Roses and the English Civil War and has consequently been rebuilt a number of times in its history. It is now open to the public, whilst still remaining a family home. In recent years the Belvoir name has become more widely known through the national and international sale of various cordials and other produce, a scheme introduced by the present duke\\'s father to raise funds for the continued upkeep of the castle and to provide employment in an otherwise farm-dominated local economy. Two other local specialities dominate the world reputation of the vale: Stilton cheese and pork pies. Of the six dairies currently allowed to produce true Stilton cheese under the terms of its protected origin status, only one is not located in the vale. The vale is the historic centre for the production of this king of English cheeses and until the end of the 19th century all Stilton cheese was being produced within 20 miles of Melton Mowbray. However, the cheese took its name from the Huntingdonshire village of Stilton, where it was served at coaching inns on the Great North Road. Melton is also the home of the Melton Mowbray pork pie, produced by traditional methods using uncured pork and hand-formed pastry and served cold. Both Stilton cheese and Melton Mowbray pies are covered by European Protected Designation of Origin orders. \"Belvoir Angels\" are a type of 18th-century Swithland slate tombstone found in the district. A comprehensive account of the natural history of the vale was compiled in 1790 by the poet George Crabbe, who was chaplain to the Duke of Rutland and later concurrent Rector of Muston, Leicestershire, and the adjacent Allington, Lincolnshire. It includes a list of more than 70 beetle species. The vale was renowned fox hunting country and had many historical ties to the sport.A controversial coalfield development was proposed in the 1970s. It became the subject of a public enquiry in 1979. The requisite planning applications were ultimately quashed by the secretary of state for the environment in 1982. The Vale of Belvoir has an award-winning radio station – 103 The Eye – which was the UK\\'s first community radio station and has been broadcasting since 2005. Based in Melton Mowbray, it is heard on 103 FM and on its website. == References == \"About Belvoir Castle\". Belvoir Castle official website.

              " 'Vinegar Lane is a development in the suburb of Grey Lynn in Auckland, New Zealand. The $250 million project was announced in 2006 under the name Soho Square Ponsonby and was meant to be a major attraction in the area with apartments, office space and retail areas. Construction started on the site of an old yeast manufacturing plant, but progress was slow and the developers had gone into receivership by the end of 2009. In May 2010 receivers signed a conditional contract with Innovus; this bid failed due diligence and Soho Square was back on the market in August 2010. In 2011 the site was purchased by Progressive Enterprises with a plan to open a supermarket, an underground carpark, and other retail shops. As of 2021 a building featuring an underground car park, retail, and office space has been completed, as have multiple residential buildings. == Planned location and features == The project was planned for the west end of Grey Lynn, Auckland, near Western Park. It was to occupy 1.3 hectares, almost the whole block within Williamson Avenue, Pollen Street and Crummer Road.The developer website stated that the site would contain 25,000m² of office space, 35 retail shops, 53 apartments and over 1250 undercover car parking spaces. == History of the site == From 1910 the site had been a yeast production plant. The former Dominion Yeast Company site was sold in 2004 by New Zealand Food Industries (now part of the international AB Mauri group) and up until that stage had been producing nearly all of the compressed yeast in New Zealand. The plant has since been moved to Hamilton.In 2006 the Marlin Group bought the place. The resulting proposal caused controversy: many in the area protested against the development. In 2008 resource consent was turned down. Protests against the development continued after construction had halted; one included a group of artists using the area as a swimming pool.By early 2010, the development had not progressed further than the initial excavation for five floors of planned underground car park. This site remained unused for some months, and Progressive Enterprises bought it in June 2011. Construction has completed on much of the site, which includes mix of retail and residential property and a large Countdown supermarket. The new development is called Vinegar Lane, and comprises two precincts, Cider and Vinegar, which reference the former use of the site. The Cider Building houses the Countdown supermarket, office space and retail, and the Vinegar precinct is mixed commercial and residential buildings. As of October 2021, many of the buildings in the Vinegar precinct have been completed, with some under construction and several empty lots remaining. == References == == External links == Soho Square - The company website is currently offline',\n",

              " 'The Berlin U-Bahn (German: [ˈuː baːn]; short for Untergrundbahn, \"underground railway\") is a rapid transit system in Berlin, the capital and largest city of Germany, and a major part of the city\\'s public transport system. Together with the S-Bahn, a network of suburban train lines, and a tram network that operates mostly in the eastern parts of the city, it serves as the main means of transport in the capital. Opened in 1902, the U-Bahn serves 175 stations spread across nine lines, with a total track length of 155.4 kilometres (96 miles 45 chains), about 80% of which is underground. Trains run every two to five minutes during peak hours, every five minutes for the rest of the day and every ten minutes in the evening. Over the course of a year, U-Bahn trains travel 132 million kilometres (82 million miles), and carry over 400 million passengers. In 2017, 553.1 million passengers rode the U-Bahn. The entire system is maintained and operated by the Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe, commonly known as the BVG. Designed to alleviate traffic flowing into and out of central Berlin, the U-Bahn was rapidly expanded until the city was divided into East and West Berlin at the end of World War II. Although the system remained open to residents of both sides at first, the construction of the Berlin Wall and the subsequent restrictions imposed by East Germany limited travel across the border. The East Berlin U-Bahn lines from West Berlin were severed, except for two West Berlin lines that ran through East Berlin (U6 and U8). These were allowed to pass through East Berlin without stopping at any of the stations, which were closed. Friedrichstraße was the exception because it was used as a transfer point between U6 and the West Berlin S-Bahn system, and a border crossing into East Berlin. The system was reopened completely following the fall of the Berlin Wall and German reunification. The Berlin U-Bahn is the most extensive underground network in Germany. In 2006, travel on the U-Bahn was equivalent to 122.2 million km (76 million mi) of car journeys. == History == The Berlin U-Bahn was built in three major phases: Up to 1913: the construction of the Kleinprofil (small profile) network in Berlin, Charlottenburg, Schöneberg, and Wilmersdorf; Up to 1930: the introduction of the Großprofil (large profile) network that established the first north–south lines; From 1953 on: further development after World War II.In a bid to secure its own improvement, Schöneberg also wanted a connection to Berlin. The elevated railway company did not believe such a line would be profitable, so the city built the first locally financed underground in Germany (intentionally using standard of Kleinprofil). It was opened on 1 December 1910. Just a few months earlier, work began on a fourth line to link Wilmersdorf in the southwest to the growing Berlin U-Bahn. The early network ran mostly east to west, connecting the richer areas in and around Berlin, as these routes had been deemed the most profitable. In order to open up the network to more of the workers of Berlin, the city wanted north–south lines to be established. In 1920, the surrounding areas were annexed to form Groß-Berlin (\"Greater Berlin\"), removing the need for many negotiations, and giving the city much greater bargaining power over the private Hochbahngesellschaft (\"elevated railway company\"). The city also mandated that new lines would use wider carriages—running on the same, standard-gauge track—to provide greater passenger capacity; these became known as the Großprofil (\"large profile\") network. Construction of the Nord-Süd-Bahn (\"North-South railway\") connecting Wedding in the north to Tempelhof and Neukölln in the south had started in December 1912, but halted for the First World War. Work resumed in 1919, although the money shortage caused by hyperinflation slowed progress considerably. On 30 January 1923, the first section opened between Hallesches Tor and Stettiner Bahnhof (Naturkundemuseum), with a continuation to Seestraße following two months later. Desperately underfunded, the new line had to use trains from the old Kleinprofil network; the carriages exits had to be widened to fill the gap to the platforms with wooden boards that passengers jokingly referred to as Blumenbretter (\"boards for flower pots\"). The line branched at Belle-Alliance-Straße, now (Mehringdamm); the continuation south to Tempelhof opened on 22 December 1929, the branch to Grenzallee on 21 December 1930. In 1912, plans were approved for AEG to build its own north–south underground line, named the GN-Bahn after its termini, Gesundbrunnen and Neukölln, via Alexanderplatz. Financial difficulties stopped the construction in 1919; the liquidation of AEG-Schnellbahn-AG, and Berlin\\'s commitment to the Nord-Süd-Bahn, prevented any further development until 1926. The first section opened on 17 July 1927 between Boddinstraße and Schönleinstraße, with the intermediate Hermannplatz becoming the first station at which passengers could transfer between two different Großprofil lines. The completed route was opened on 18 April 1930. Before control of the U-Bahn network was handed over completely to the BVG in 1929, the Hochbahngesellschaft started construction on a final line that, in contrast to its previous lines, was built as part of the Großprofil network. The major development was stopped in 1930. The seizure of power by the National Socialists brought many changes that affected Germany, including the U-Bahn. Most notably, the new national flag was hung in every station, and two of the stations were renamed. Extensive plans—mostly the work of architect Albert Speer—were drawn up that included the construction of a circular line crossing the established U-Bahn lines, and new lines or extensions to many outlying districts. Despite such grand plans, no U-Bahn development occurred. In the Nazi period the only addition to Berlin\\'s underground railways was North–South Tunnel of S-Bahn, opened 1936–1939. During the Second World War, U-Bahn travel soared as car use fell, and many of the underground stations were used as air-raid shelters; however, Allied bombs damaged or destroyed large parts of the U-Bahn system. Although the damage was usually repaired fairly quickly, the reconstructions became more difficult as the war went on. Eventually, on 25 April 1945, the whole system ground to a halt when the power station supplying the network failed. Upon unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany following the Battle for Berlin there were 437 damaged points and 496 damaged vehicles. The war had damaged or destroyed much of the network; however, 69.5 km (43.2 mi) of track and 93 stations were in use by the end of 1945, and the reconstruction was completed in 1950. Nevertheless, the consequent division of Berlin into East and West sectors brought further changes to the U-Bahn. Although the network spanned all sectors, and residents had freedom of movement, West Berliners increasingly avoided the Soviet sector and, from 1953, loudspeakers on the trains gave warnings when approaching the border, where passage of East Germans into the Western sectors also became subject to restrictions imposed by their government. There was a general strike on 17 June 1953 which closed the sections of the Berlin U-Bahn that traveled through East Berlin. Just after the strike, on the following day, train service on the line A was resumed and the service C was resumed to provide connections to Nordbahnhof and Friedrichstraße. Between 1953 and 1955, the 200-Kilometre-Plan was drawn up, detailing the future development of the U-Bahn, which would grow to 200 km (124.3 mi). Extending the C line to run from Tegel to Alt-Mariendorf was considered the highest priority: the northern extension to Tegel was opened on 31 May 1958. In order to circumvent East Berlin, and provide rapid-transport connections to the densely populated areas in Steglitz, Wedding, and Reinickendorf, a third north–south line was needed. The first section of line G was built between Leopoldplatz and Spichernstraße, with the intention of extending it at both ends. It had been planned to open the G line on 2 September 1961, but an earlier opening on 28 August was forced by the announcement of the construction of the Berlin Wall. The next crisis was followed by the Berlin Wall construction on 13 August 1961, which had split the city between east and west. The U2 was split into two sections, and for the north–south lines, trains were not allowed to stop for passengers and become Geisterbahnhöfe (\"ghost stations\"), patrolled by armed East-German border guards. Only at Friedrichstraße, a designated border crossing point, were passengers allowed to disembark. A further consequence over the years is that most of the Berlin S-Bahn passengers boycotted the Deutsche Reichsbahn, and transferred to the U-Bahn with numerous expansion. From 9 November 1989, following months of unrest, the travel restrictions placed upon East Germans were lifted. Tens of thousands of East Berliners heard the statement live on television and flooded the border checkpoints, demanding entry into West Berlin. Jannowitzbrücke, a former ghost station, was reopened two days later as an additional crossing point. It was the first station to be reopened after the opening of the Berlin Wall. Other stations, Rosenthaler Platz and Bernauer Straße on the U8 soon followed suit; and by 1 July 1990, all border controls were removed. In the decade following reunification, only three short extensions were made to U-Bahn lines. In the 1990s some stations in the eastern portion of the city still sported bullet-riddled tiles at their entrances, a result of World War II battle damage during the Battle of Berlin. These were removed by 21 December 2004. == U-Bahn network == === Routes === The U-Bahn has nine lines: === Stations === Among Berlin\\'s 170 U-Bahn stations there are many with especially striking architecture or unusual design characteristics: Hermannplatz station resembles something of a U-Bahn cathedral. The platform area is 7 metres high, 132 metres long and 22 metres wide. It was built in connection with the construction of the first North-South Line (Nord-Süd-Bahn), now the U8. The architecturally important department store Karstadt adjacent to the station, was being constructed at the same time. Karstadt contributed a large sum of money towards the decoration of the station and was in return rewarded with direct access from the station to the store. Hermannplatz was also the first U-Bahn station in Berlin to be equipped with escalators. Today, Hermannplatz is a busy interchange between the U7 and U8. Alexanderplatz station is another of the more notable U-Bahn stations in Berlin, and is an important interchange between three lines (U2, U5 and U8). The first part of the station was opened in 1913 along with an extension of today\\'s U2 line. In the 1920s Alexanderplatz was completely redesigned, both above and below ground. The U-Bahn station was expanded to provide access to the new D (today\\'s U8) and E (today\\'s U5) lines, then under construction. The result was a station with a restrained blue-grey tiled colour-scheme and Berlin\\'s first underground shopping facilities, designed by Alfred Grenander. Over the last few years Alexanderplatz station has, in stages, been restored; the work was due to be finished in 2007. Wittenbergplatz station is also unusually designed. It opened in 1902 as a simple station with two side platforms, designed to plans created by Paul Wittig. The station was completely redesigned by Alfred Grenander in 1912, with five platform faces, accommodating two new lines, one to Dahlem on today\\'s (U3), and the other to Kurfürstendamm, today\\'s Uhlandstraße (Berlin U-Bahn) on the (U1). A provision for a sixth platform was included but has never been completed. The redesign also featured a new entrance building, which blended into the grand architectural styles of Wittenbergplatz and the nearby KaDeWe department store. The interior of the entrance building was again rebuilt after considerable war damage during World War II, this time in a contemporary 1950s style. This lasted until the early 1980s when the interior was retro-renovated back into its original style. Wittenbergplatz station was presented with a London style \"Roundel type\" station sign in 1952, the 50th Anniversary of the Berlin U-Bahn. Today\\'s station is an interchange station between the U1, U2 and U3 lines. The name of the Gleisdreieck (rail triangle) station is reminiscent of a construction which can only be imagined today. The wye was built in the opening year 1902. Plans for a redesign were made soon after, because the wye was already obsolete. An accident on 26 September 1908, which claimed 18 to 21 lives, was the final straw. The redesign and expansion of the Turmbahnhof, during which the station was still used, took until 1912. After World War II the station was put back into service on 21 October 1945 (lower platform) and 18 November 1945 (upper platform). However, service was interrupted again by the construction of the Berlin Wall. From 1972 onwards no trains ran on the lower platform, because servicing the U2 was no longer profitable due to the parallel traffic on the U1. The lower platform was reactivated in 1983, when the test line of the M-Bahn was built from the Gleisdreieck to the Kemperplatz station. It was broken down again after the fall of the Berlin Wall, since it obstructed parts of the reopened U2. Since 1993 the U1 and U2 trains both service the station again. === Tickets === Berlin public transit passes are available from many places, automated and non-automated, from BVG, Bahn, and authorized third-parties. The Ring-Bahn Line and the other S-Bahn lines are included, as are all U-Bahn lines, buses, trams, ferries, and most trains within the city limits: tickets are valid for all transportation considered part of the Berlin-Regional public transit system. Ride-passes (tickets) are available in fare classes: Adult and Reduced. Children between the ages of six and 14 and large dogs qualify for the reduced fare. Children below the age of six and small dogs travel free. There are senior discounts in the form of an annual ticket. Residents who have applied for and received a German Disability Identification card confirming 80% or more disability (ID\\'s available from the Versorgungsamt, German Disability Office), can ride without a pass, including an additional person (as a helper). The disability identification card must be in the owner\\'s possession when traveling. With unemployment in the east averaging 15%, another common fare class in Berlin is the S(ocial)-Class. These identification cards are cleared through the normal government offices, then fulfilled at a BVG ride-pass non-automated location. Provided either by the Job Center (Arbeitsamt) for out-of-work residents or by the Sozialamt for people who cannot work or are disabled, the S-Class ride-passes normally restrict travel to the AB zones and must be renewed (a new pass purchased at a non-automated location) on the 1st of each month. Additional passes are available for those which want to bring a bicycle on the public transit system. A bicycle-pass is included in the Student-class ride-pass, which is provided through the universities. For small dogs which can be carried there is no additional fare requirement. For each \"large dog\", a reduced fare ride-pass must be purchased. Tourist ride-passes, all-day, group passes, and season passes include a dog fare. BVG ride-passes are issued for specific periods of time, and most require validation with a stamping machine before they are first used. The validation shows the date and time of the first use, and where the ticket was validated (in code), and therefore when the ticket expires. For example, once validated, an all-day pass allows unlimited use from the time of purchase to 3:00 am the following day. Unlike most other metro systems, tickets in Berlin are not checked before entering tram, U-Bahn or S-Bahn stations. They are however checked by the bus drivers upon entering. On the tram, S-Bahn and U-Bahn, a proof-of-payment system is used: there are random spot checks inside by plain-clothed fare inspectors who have the right to demand to see each passenger\\'s ticket. Passengers found without a ticket or an expired/invalid ticket are fined €60 per incident. The passenger may be required to pay on the spot, and is required on the spot to give a valid address to which the relevant fine notice can be mailed (it does not have to be in Germany). On the third incident, the BVG calls the offender to court, as there is now a history of \\'riding without paying\\'. Fare zonesBerlin is a part of the Verkehrsverbund Berlin-Brandenburg (Berlin-Brandenburg Transit Authority, VBB), which means ticketing and fare systems are unified with that of the surrounding state of Brandenburg. Berlin is divided into three fare zones, known as A, B, and C. Zone A is the area in the centre of Berlin and is demarcated by the S-Bahn urban rail ring line. Zone B covers the rest of the area within the city borders, and Zone C includes the immediate surroundings of Berlin. Zone C is divided into eight parts, each belonging to an administrative district. The Potsdam-Mittelmark area is included in the city district of Potsdam.Tickets can be bought for specific fare zones, or multiple zones. Most passengers who live in Berlin buy AB fare zone tickets, while commuters coming in from the suburbs need ABC fare zone tickets. If a ticket not valid for travel in a tariff zone is checked by a ticket inspector, the passenger is subject to a fine.Short-term tickets Single-journey tickets (Einzeltickets) are issued for use within specific fare zones, namely AB, BC, and ABC. They are only valid for two hours after validation, and cannot be extended. The BVG also offers single-day tickets (Tageskarte), which are valid for the entire day when first validated until 3 a.m. the next morning.Long-term tickets Long-term paper tickets are issued with validity periods of seven days (7-Tage-Karte), one month (Monatskarten), or one year (Jahreskarte). The BVG is in the process of introducing the plastic MetroCard as a yearly ticket that also has additional features. The Metrocard also permits passengers to make reservations for hire cars at specific times, for example on weekends. It is expected that plastic Metrocards without such features will also be made available as they are more durable and ecofriendly than the paper tickets.Tourist passes The BVG offers tickets directed specifically for non-resident tourists of Berlin called the WelcomeCard and CityTourCard [1]. WelcomeCards are valid for either 48 or 72 hours, and can be used by one adult and up to three children between the ages of six and 14. WelcomeCards are valid in fare zones ABC, and have the additional benefit of a reduction on entry fees to many museums and tourist attractions. See the Current Prices and Descriptions link for more information. === Underground facilities === A full GSM (GSM-900 and GSM-1800) mobile phone network for Germany\\'s four carriers is in place throughout the U-Bahn system of stations and tunnels. This system was in place by 1995 for the E-Plus network, and was one of the first metro systems in the world to allow mobile telephone use; by the late-1990s the other networks could be used in some portions as well. Since 2015, UMTS and LTE is also available for E-Plus and O2 (LTE since 2016) customers, and since 2020 mobile reception in some underground sections has also been extended to Deutsche Telekom and Vodafone Germany customers, with complete reception for the latter two telcos expected to be realised by mid-2021.Many of the carriages on the U-Bahn feature small flat screen displays that feature news headlines from BZ, weekly weather forecasts, and ads for local businesses. Most major interchange stations have large shopping concourses with banks, supermarkets, and fast food outlets. === Unused stations and tunnels === There are several stations, platforms and tunnels that were built in preparation for future U-Bahn extensions, and others that have been abandoned following planning changes. For example, platforms have already been provided for the planned \"U3\" at Potsdamer Platz on the planned line to Weißensee. It is unlikely that this line, which had the working title \"U3\" will ever be built, so the platforms have been partially converted into a location for events and exhibitions. The line number \"U3\" has been used to re-number the branch to Krumme Lanke, which had been part of \"U1\". Line D, today\\'s U8, was intended to run directly under Dresdner Straße via Oranienplatz to Kottbusser Tor. This segment of tunnel was abandoned in favour of a slightly less direct route in order to provide the former Wertheim department store at Moritzplatz with a direct connection. This involved the construction of a 90-degree curve of the line between Moritzplatz and Kottbusser Tor stations. The construction of the tunnel under Dresdner Straße had only been partially completed before abandonment, leaving it with only one track. This tunnel is separated into three parts, as it was blocked by a concrete wall where it crossed the border between East and West Berlin. Another concrete wall separates this tunnel, which now houses a transformer for an electricity supplier, from the never-completed Oranienplatz Station which is located partially under the square of the same name. Stralauer Tor was a station on the eastern bank of the Spree between Warschauer Straße and Schlesisches Tor stations. It was completely destroyed in World War II. It had been opened in 1902 and was renamed Osthafen in 1924. Today, only struts on the viaduct remain to indicate its location. In the post-Second World War period it was not thought necessary to rebuild the station, due its close proximity to the Warschauer Straße station. Also its location was directly on the border between the Soviet and American sectors. Although a Berlin map dated 1946 shows the station renamed as Bersarinstraße after the Soviet General responsible for restoring civil administration of the city, this name was used later at another location. Nürnberger Platz station was closed on 1 July 1959. It was replaced by two new stations on either side, Augsburger Straße and an interchange station to the U9 at Spichernstraße. Today, nothing remains of the station as a third track siding was constructed in its place. Another tunnel, which once connected the U4 to its original depot and workshop at Otzenstraße (Schöneberg), is still in existence. The connection from Innsbrucker Platz station to the depot was severed when a deep level motorway underpass was constructed in the early 1970s; however, the continuation of the tunnel at Eisackstraße is still in existence for a distance of 270 metres and now ends at the former junction to the workshop of the Schöneberg line. Platforms at five stations, Rathaus Steglitz, Schloßstraße, Walther-Schreiber-Platz, Innsbrucker Platz, and Kleistpark, were provided for the planned but never constructed U10. The U10 platform at Kleistpark has been converted into office space for the BVG. At Schloßstraße, U9 and U10 were planned to share two directional platforms at different levels; the would-be U10 tracks have been abandoned, leaving both platforms used by U9 trains only. The other U10 platforms remain unused and are not generally open to the public. During the construction of Adenauerplatz (U7) station, which was built in conjunction with an underpass, platforms were also provided for a planned U1 extension from Uhlandstraße to Theodor-Heuss-Platz. A short tunnel section was also constructed in front of the Internationales Congress Centrum (ICC), beneath the Messedamm/Neue Kantstraße junction. This tunnel was built concurrently with a pedestrian subway and was also intended for the planned extension of the U1. The tunnel section, approximately 60 metres long, ends at the location of the planned Messe station adjacent to Berlins central bus station (ZOB). The tunnel is used as a storage area for theater props. At Jungfernheide station, double U-Bahn platforms similar to those at Schloßstraße were built for the planned extension of the U5. The unused platform sides are fenced off. The finished (U5) tunnel section which leads off towards Tegel airport is now used for firefighting exercises. On 4 December 2020, the U5 extension between Alexanderplatz and Brandenburger Tor was opened. This included the new Unter den Linden station, which acts as a transfer point between the lines U5 and U6. Französische Straße station on the U6 was simultaneously closed due to its short distance to the new station. === Future development === Berlin\\'s chronic financial problems make any expansion not mandated by the Hauptstadtvertrag—the document that regulates the necessary changes to the city as the capital of Germany—unlikely. Furthermore, there is still great rivalry for construction money between the U-Bahn and the S-Bahn. After the construction boom that followed the reunification of the city, enthusiasm for further growth has cooled off; many people feel that Berlin\\'s needs are adequately met by the present U- and S-Bahn. As of 2020, the only proposals receiving serious consideration aim to facilitate travel around the existing system, such as moving Warschauer Straße\\'s U-Bahn station closer to its S-Bahn station. There are several long-term plans for the U-Bahn that have no estimated time of completion, most of which involve closing short gaps between stations, enabling them to connect to other lines. This would depend on demand, and new developments in the vicinity. New construction of U-Bahn lines is frequently the subject of political discussion with the Berlin chapters of the CDU, FDP and AfD who usually advocate in favor of U-Bahn expansion while the SPD, Die Grünen and Die Linke typically advocate for tram construction instead. After the last extension of U5 opened on 4 December 2020, there are no immediate plans to expand the metro system due to lack of budgetary conditions, although there are several extensions of railway lines that can be discussed over time: == Rolling stock == The Berlin U-Bahn uses 750-volt DC electric trains that run on standard gauge (1,435 mm (4 ft 8+1⁄2 in) ) tracks. The first trains were based on trams; they have a width of 2.30 m (7 ft 6+9⁄16 in), and take their power from an upward facing third rail. To accommodate greater passenger numbers without lengthening the trains—which would require costly extended platforms—trains that ran on lines built after World War I were required to be wider. The original trains and lines, which continued to operate, were designated Kleinprofil (small profile), and the newer, wider trains and lines were designated Großprofil (large profile). Großprofil trains are 2.65 m (8 ft 8+5⁄16 in) wide, and take their power from a downward facing third rail. This is similar to New York City\\'s A Division and B Division systems, where the B Division trains are wider than A Division trains (though B Division trains are also longer, while Großprofil trains are generally about the same length as Kleinprofil ones). Although the two profiles are generally incompatible, Kleinprofil trains have been modified to run on Großprofil lines during three periods of economic difficulty. Between 1923 and 1927 on the Nord-Süd-Bahn, and between 1961 and 1978 on the E line, adapted Kleinprofil trains were used to compensate for the lack of new Großprofil trains: they were widened with wooden boards to reach the platforms; and had their power pickups adapted to accept power from the negatively charged downward-facing third rail, instead of positively charged upward-facing third rail. As of 2017, Class IK Kleinprofil trains are in operation on the Großprofil line U5, after refurbishing the existing F79 rolling stock was deemed unfeasible. They were widened with metal boards by 17.5 cm (6.9 in) on each side and elevated by 7.5 cm (3.0 in) to close the gap to the platforms; their power pickups were designed reversible to work on both profiles. As of October 2019, IK rolling stock is still used on the U5; it is intended to move the trains to Kleinprofil lines once new Großprofil rolling stock has been delivered. As of 2007, Kleinprofil trains run on the U1, U2, U3, U4 and U5 lines; and Großprofil trains operate on the U5, U55, U6, U7, U8, and U9 routes. === Kleinprofil (small profile) === Kleinprofil trains are 2.30 m (7 ft 6+9⁄16 in) wide, and 3.10 m (10 ft 2+1⁄16 in) high. When the U-Bahn opened in 1902, forty-two multiple units, and twenty-one railroad cars, with a top speed of 50 km/h (31.1 mph), had been built at the Warschauer Brücke workshop. In contrast to the earlier test vehicles, seating was placed along the walls, facing inward, which was considered more comfortable. Until 1927, U-Bahn trains had smoking compartments and third-class carriages. The trains were first updated in 1928; A-II carriages were distinguished by only having three windows, and two sliding doors. After the division of the city, West Berlin upgraded its U-Bahn trains more rapidly than did East Berlin. The A3 type, introduced in 1960, was modelled on the Großprofil D type, and received regular modifications every few years. Meanwhile, A-I and A-II trains operated exclusively in East Berlin until 1975, when G-I trains, which had a top speed of 70 km/h (43.5 mph), started to travel the Thälmannplatz–Pankow route. These were superseded in 1988 by the G-I/1 type, which used couplings that were incompatible with the older G-I carriages. Following reunification, the A3L type was again upgraded as the A3L92. In 2000, prototypes for a Kleinprofil variant of the H series were built; the HK, the first Kleinprofil type to use AC induction motors like their large counterparts, differs from its Großprofil counterpart by not being fully interconnected—carriages are only interconnected within each of the two half-trains. As of 2005, only trains of the HK, G-I/1 and A3(U/L) types are in active service. From 2017, new IK-type trains will enter service to replace the remaining examples of type A3L71. Like HK-type trains they will be interconnected and as a result of their regenerative braking will recuperate up to 20% of the energy they require. === Großprofil (large profile) === Großprofil trains are 2.65 m (8 ft 8+5⁄16 in) wide, and 3.40 m (11 ft 1+7⁄8 in) high. The first sixteen multiple units and eight ordinary carriages entered active service on the Nord-Süd-Bahn in 1924, after a year of using modified Kleinprofil trains. Designated B-I, the cars were 13.15 m (43 ft 1+11⁄16 in) long and each had three sliding doors; the large elliptical windows at the front of the train earned them the nickname, Tunneleulen (tunnel owls). Upgraded B-II trains were introduced in 1927, and continued to be used until 1969. The first 18-metre-long (59 ft 11⁄16 in) C-I trains were trialled in 1926, and two upgrades were produced before the end of the decade. The first U-Bahn trains to use aluminium in their construction, the C-IV types, were introduced in 1930. Many C-type trains were seized by Soviet forces in 1945, to be used in the Moscow Metro. The first D-type trains, manufactured in 1957, were built from steel, making them very heavy and less efficient; however, the DL type that followed from 1965 used metals that were less dense, allowing a 26% reduction in weight. In East Berlin, D-type trains bought from the BVG were designated D-I. Difficulties there in trying to develop an E series of trains led, in 1962, to the conversion of S-Bahn type 168 trains for use on the E line. These E-III trains were desperately needed at the time to allow modified Kleinprofil trains to return to the increasingly busy A line but, following reunification, high running costs led to their retirement in 1994. In West Berlin, the successor to the D-type was the F-type, which debuted in 1973. They varied from other models in having seats that were perpendicular to the sides of the train; from 1980, they also became the first U-Bahn trains to use three-phase electricity. In 1995, the original seating arrangement returned as the H series took up service. H-type trains are characterised by the interconnection of carriages throughout the length of the train; and they can only be removed from the tracks at main service depots. As of 2005, only F, H, and a variation of the IK-type trains are in active service. === Depots === Depots of the Berlin U-Bahn fall into one of two classes: main workshops (German: Hauptwerkstätten, abbreviated as Hw); and service workshops (German: Betriebswerkstätten, abbreviated Bw). The main workshops are the only places where trains can be lifted from the tracks; they are used for the full inspections required every few years, and for any major work on trains. The service workshops only handle minor repairs and maintenance, such as replacing windows, or removing graffiti. As of 2005, the only dedicated Kleinprofil depot is at Grunewald (Hw Gru/Bw Gru), which opened on 21 January 1913. The first Großprofil depot opened at Seestraße (Hw See/Bw See) in 1923, to service the Nord-Süd-Bahn. It has 17 tracks—2 for the main workshop, and 15 for the service workshop—but its inner-city location prevents any further expansion. Due to BVG budget cuts, the Seestraße depot also services Kleinprofil trains. Two further Großprofil service workshops are located at Friedrichsfelde (Bw Fri), and Britz-Süd (Bw Britz). In the past, there were other workshops. The first opened in 1901 at Warschauer Brücke, and was the construction site for most of the early U-Bahn trains. The division of the U-Bahn network on 13 August 1961 forced its closure, although it was reopened in 1995 as a storage depot. A small depot operated at Krumme Lanke between 22 December 1929 and 1 May 1968; and, while the network was split, East Berlin\\'s U-Bahn used the S-Bahn depot at Schöneweide, along with a small service workshop at Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz, which was closed following reunification. == Accidents == The Berlin U-Bahn ranks among the safest modes of transport: its history features few accidents. The most severe accident occurred at the original Gleisdreieck (rail triangle), where the main and branch lines were connected by switches that allowed the tracks to cross. On 26 September 1908, a train driver missed a stop signal. As a result, two trains collided at the junction, and one fell off the viaduct. The accident killed eighteen people, and severely injured another twenty-one. Gleisdreieck\\'s triangular layout had already been deemed unsuitable for future developments; this incident—and a later, less-serious one—triggered its reconstruction as a multi-level station, starting in 1912.On 30 June 1965, a train with brake failure stopped on the G line—today\\'s U9—between Zoologischer Garten and Hansaplatz. Unaware of the faulty train, a mechanic working at the Zoologischer Garten signal tower noticed that the signal for the affected section had been set to \"Stop\" for a long time. Thinking it was a fault of his, after several attempts he manually overrode the signal, in defiance of regulations that strictly prohibited such actions. The following train, which had been waiting at Zoologischer Garten, then left the station on the same track. With emergency brakes unable to prevent the accident, the two trains collided. One passenger was killed in the crash, and 97 were injured. The mechanic was fined 600,000 DM.Fires can be particularly dangerous and damaging within an underground system. In October 1972, two trains and a 200 m length of tunnel were completely destroyed when the trains caught fire; the reconstructed tunnel is clearly distinguishable from the old one. Another train burned out in the connecting tunnel between Klosterstraße and Alexanderplatz in 1987. On 8 July 2000, the last car of a GI/I train suffered a short circuit, burning out at the rear of the Deutsche Oper station. The single exit of the station was unreachable, forcing the passengers to run through the tunnel to reach the next emergency exit. The fire also damaged the station, which remained closed until that September. The Portuguese Ambassador, João Diogo Nunes Barata, presented the BVG with azulejos (tiled paintings), specially designed for the station, by the artist José de Guimarães. Installation of Portugal\\'s gift to the city was completed on 30 October 2002. As a consequence of the Deutsche Oper incident, BVG decided to post an employee at every station with only one exit until a second exit could be built. Over the following few years, many of those stations—including Britz-Süd, Schillingstraße, Viktoria-Luise-Platz, Uhlandstraße, and Theodor-Heuss-Platz—were retrofitted with additional exits. By June 2008, the only remaining stations with no second exit, Konstanzer Straße and Rudow, had been fitted with second exits. Despite these changes, several passenger organisations—such as Pro Bahn, and IGEB—demand that stations with exits in the middle of the platform also be fitted with additional emergency exits. Many stations are built this way; meeting those demands would place a heavy financial burden on both the BVG and the city.The U6 saw a particularly costly, though casualty-free, incident on 25 March 2003. Scheduled repair work on the line limited the normal service to between Alt-Mariendorf and Kurt-Schumacher-Platz; one train then shuttled back and forth between Kurt-Schumacher-Platz and Holzhauser Straße, sharing a platform at Kurt-Schumacher-Platz with the normal-service trains departing for their return journey to Alt-Mariendorf. Needing to pass several stop signals on the shuttle service, the driver had been given special instructions how to proceed. Unfortunately, he ignored the signal at the entry to Kurt-Schumacher-Platz, and ploughed into the side of a train heading back to Alt-Mariendorf. The impact wrecked both trains, and caused considerable damage to the tracks. Normal service did not resume for two days, and the removal of the two wrecked trains—which, surprisingly, could still roll along the tracks—also took nearly 48 hours. == Films, music and merchandising == The Berlin U-Bahn has appeared in numerous films and music videos. Offering access to stations, tunnels, and trains, the BVG cooperates with film-makers, although a permit is required.Whether set in Berlin or elsewhere, the U-Bahn has had at least a minor role in a large number of movies and television programmes, including Emil and the Detectives (2001), Otto – Der Film (1985), Bang! You\\'re Dead! (1987) featuring Ingolf Lück, Run Lola Run (1998), and several Tatort episodes. The previously unused Reichstag station was used to shoot scenes of the movies Resident Evil and Equilibrium. The U Bahn station Messe was used as coverage in the films Hanna and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2. Möbius 17, by Frank Esher Lämmer and Jo Preussler from Berlin, tells the story of an U-Bahn train that, caught in a Möbius strip, travels through alternate universes after a new line is built. Alexanderplatz station plays an essential role in Berlin Alexanderplatz—a film of thirteen hour-long chapters and one epilogue—produced in 1980 by Rainer Werner Fassbinder, based on the book by Döblin. The film\\'s scenes feature a recreation of the station as it was in 1928—rather darker and dirtier than in the 21st century. In the surrealistic two-hour epilogue, Fassbinder transforms parts of the station into a slaughterhouse where people are killed and dissected. Since 2001, the Berlin U-Bahn has hosted the annual short-film festival Going Underground. Short films (up to 90 seconds long) are shown on the monitors found in many of the U-Bahn trains. Passengers on board vote for the festival winner. Sandy Mölling, former singer of the pop band No Angels, shot the video for her single \"Unnatural Blonde\" in the U-Bahn station Deutsche Oper. Kate Ryan, Overground, Böhse Onkelz, Xavier Naidoo, Die Fantastischen Vier, and the DJ duo Blank & Jones have all used the U-Bahn and its stations for their videos as well. \"Linie 1\", a musical performed by Berlin\\'s Grips-Theater, is set completely in stations and trains of the Berlin U-Bahn; a movie version has also been produced. In 2002, the BVG cooperated with design students in a project to create underwear with an U-Bahn theme, which, in English, they named \"Underwear\". They used the names of real stations that, in the context of underwear, appeared to be mild sexual double entendres: men\\'s underpants bore labels with Rohrdamm (pipe dam), Onkel Toms Hütte (Uncle Tom\\'s Cabin), and Krumme Lanke (crooked lake); the women\\'s had Gleisdreieck (triangle track), and Jungfernheide (virgin heath). After the first series sold out quickly, several others were commissioned, such as Nothammer (emergency hammer), and Pendelverkehr (shuttle service; though Verkehr also means \"intercourse\" and Pendel also means \"pendulum\"). They were withdrawn from sale in 2004. == See also == == References == == Bibliography == == External links == Berlin Metro Map on Google Maps with Geolocation Official website (in English) VSWB – Disused Rails and Lanes in Berlin Photo tour of U-Bahn stations including map of architectural styles pics of Berlin Metro Track map of the Berlin U-Bahn Berlin U-Bahn Map Photographing the Berlin U-Bahn',\n",

              " 'Little Crackers is a British Christmas comedy-drama that was broadcast on Sky1. It consists of a series of short films featuring stars of British and Irish comedy, including Stephen Fry, Catherine Tate, Chris O\\'Dowd, Kathy Burke, Victoria Wood, and Bill Bailey. According to Sky Television, the show marked the start of their biggest investment in British comedy during Sky1\\'s twenty-year history. The success of the first series led Sky to renew the show for a second series, which began airing on 18 December 2011. The comedians involved in the second series included Harry Hill, Sheridan Smith, Sanjeev Bhaskar, John Bishop, Shappi Khorsandi and Jack Whitehall. Moone Boy, created by and starring Chris O\\'Dowd for Sky1, and Walking and Talking, written by and starring Kathy Burke for Sky Atlantic, are both full series based on Little Crackers shorts. They have been commissioned for 6 episodes and 4 episodes respectively. == Summary == In the films, the stars – with the help of rising young actors such as Madeleine Power as the young Catherine Tate – recreate stories from their childhood. The films, which last between 10 and 12 minutes each, include Catherine Tate reenacting an occasion when she decided to mimic the controversial singer Gary Glitter in a school nativity; Stephen Fry as a head teacher doling out corporal punishment to his younger self played by Daniel Roche; and Dawn French as the Queen Mother, whom she met at the age of four. David Baddiel, Julian Barratt, Bill Bailey, Jo Brand, Victoria Wood, Chris O\\'Dowd and Julia Davis are among the other actors who recreate childhood incidents and memories.Catherine Tate\\'s Little Cracker, My First Nativity, was nominated for Best Comedy Programme, at the British Academy Television Awards 2011. It was beaten by BBC Two\\'s Harry and Paul. == Production == The series was commissioned by Sky1 after the success of the short film series 10 Minute Tales in 2009. That series featured 12 silent short films of around 8 minutes in length and starred popular British actors (including Bill Nighy) and was directed by Ian Rickson.Two of the episodes were produced by Silver River. The titles of the two episodes were revealed as \"First Kiss\" and \"Satan\\'s Hoof\", starring Julia Davis and Julian Barratt respectively. A further three episodes were produced by Tiger Aspect: \"Better Than Christmas\", \"The Queen Mother\\'s Visit\" (alternatively known as \"Operation Big Hat\") and \"My First Nativity\".The first series of Little Crackers saw Catherine Tate, Julia Davis and Bill Bailey, marking their directorial debuts. == Broadcast == The show began airing on Sky1 and in high definition on Sky1 HD on 19 December 2010. Two episodes were broadcast each evening until 23 December, while the final two episodes were broadcast on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. The Meera Syal short was the UK\\'s first ever scripted TV comedy broadcast in 3D.A second series of 11 episodes was broadcast on Sky1 from 18 to 23 December 2011.

              " \"The Chen-Kao reaction (named after Ko Kuei Chen and Chung-Hsi Kao, Madison, Wisconsin 1926) is a chemical method for determining the presence of pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and similar phenylalkylamines. The reaction is used in spot tests and is also known as Chen-Kao test (or simply as Chen, Test T in UN Precursor Test Kit). The test is often used to distinguish ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, norephedrine, cathinone and methcathinone from amphetamine and methamphetamine, which do not react with Chen’s test reagent. == Testing Method == The Chen-Kao test is performed by creating an acidic solution of the compound to be tested and adding dilute Copper (II) Sulfate and Sodium hydroxide solutions.The procedure is as follows: Place small amount of material to be tested on a spot plate. Add 2 drops of reagent A Add 2 drops of reagent B Add 2 drops of reagent C A violet color indicates presence of ephedrine or pseudoephedrine Reagent A - 1% (vol/vol) aqueous acetic acid solution Reagent B - dissolve 1g Copper(II) sulfate in 100ml water Reagent C - dissolve 8g of NaOH in 100ml of water (that is 2N NaOH solution) Further, the coordination complex might be extracted with organic solvent like diethyl Ether or n-butanol (see Table II), as proposed in the literature, which provides additional confirmation of the original results, but no further differentiation. This modification is not included in the UN Precursor Test Kit and other spot tests alike. In order to further differentiate between ephedrine enantiomers - ephedrine, pseudoephedrine and other ephedrine-related compounds, Simon’s test (with acetaldehyde) and Simon’s test (with acetone) are used. (see Table III) == Reaction mechanism == When acidic solution of ephedrine or pseudoephedrine is mixed with copper sulfate and sodium hydroxide solutions, a violet color is formed. Upon shaking with ether, the organic phase turns red/purple and the aqueous phase turns blue. The staining is based on the formation of a coordination complex of two ephedrine molecules and a copper ion Cu2+This works, because, in an alkaline solution, the hydroxyl and amine groups are de-protonated, leaving a negative charge on the central atoms. They can then form a coordination complex with the positively-charged cupric ions from the copper sulfate. Phenethylamines (and their derivatives) that have a β-ketone group will also react, but less predictably and dramatically (the carbonyl oxygen is less nucleophilic than the deprotonated hydroxyl group). They usually form a deeper blue color, and often a grey-ish precipitate. This includes the cathinones and presumably βK-2C-x compounds. == Description == The execution of the Chen-Kao reaction is simple, needs little practice and limited skills. Also, the violet color obtained in the reaction is easy to define. For a correct execution, it is important to note that the typical colors develop relatively slowly, and that a good color intensity requires a sample of a few milligrams of the substances tested (i.e., more than what would typically be required for most other tests included in the UN test kits). Of all ephedrine-related compounds, only ephedrine and pseudoephedrine produce the typical, stable violet color. Other ephedrine-related compounds produce a blue to greenish-blue precipitate. This precipitate could be seen as characteristic for the members of the ephedrine group other than pseudoephedrine and ephedrine itself, hence, the Chen-Kao test appears to show a significant specificity within the ephedrine group. However, it is known from previously published cross-testing work that various pharmaceuticals not related to the ephedrine group may produce similar blue copper complexes. The two keto-amines, cathinone and methcathinone, initially also produce blue-colored complexes with the Chen-Kao reagent. However, a slow transition of the initial color into yellow, followed by an orange-brown color can be observed with both compounds, thus indicating the instability of the complexes initially formed, and an obvious decomposition of the two compounds under the alkaline conditions of this color reaction. The results of the solvent extractions, summarized in Table II appear to add little novelty to the results of the original Chen-Kao reactions. However, in cases of doubts, they may serve as confirmatory steps. == Results == == See also == Drug test Drug checking Drug testing reagents Marquis reagent Scott test Froehde reagent Duquenois–Levine reagent Ehrlich's reagent Gold(III) bromide Dille–Koppanyi reagent Liebermann reagent Mandelin reagent Mecke reagent Simon's reagent Zwikker reagent == References ==\",\n",

              " 'The Chee Kung Tong Society Hall was a former Chinese society hall located on 2151 Vineyard Street in Wailuku, Maui. Built to provide services to single immigrant Chinese males, mostly working for the sugarcane plantations, it provided religious and political help, in addition to mutual aid. Converted to a dormitory in the 1920s, it suffered neglect until finally collapsing in 1996. The site now contains remnants of the foundation, assorted cement structures, and a distinct lintel gate and wall facing the street. The site was placed on the Hawaii State Register of Historic Places and the National Register of Historic Places (under the Chinese Tong Houses of Maui Island TR nomination form), but delisted from the State register after its collapse; it is still listed in the NRHP database. == History == It is unclear when the society hall was first built due to conflicting information; County of Maui records indicate that the building was first listed as being built in 1897, though an article from December 1904 by the Maui News lists the building being built and celebrations made upon completion of the society hall on January 14 and 15, 1905.The hall provided a place for Chinese immigrants to visit, socialize (such as playing pai gow), and provide aid.Sometime in 1928, it was noted that the society hall was converted for use as a dormitory by single men, and this use was supposedly practiced up until the 1960s. After the last occupant died, the property was neglected. == Collapse == In September 1988, part of a wall of the building collapsed, smashing adjacent trees, plants, and two clothesline poles in a neighboring property.On April 17, 1996, the derelict wood building collapsed due to damage caused by wood rot, termites, and gravity. Before the collapse, Society Elders had planned to meet to discuss the fate of the building. Certain elements of the building were to have been recovered, and possibly reused in the reconstruction of the building. == Design == The property is 4,544 square feet (422.2 m2) according to Maui County tax records via the Department of Finance\\'s Real Property Division and the NRHP nomination form.The entrance gate comprises two concrete posts and a lintel with Chinese characters on it. Formerly delineated in red, the front facing the street contains incused Chinese characters spelling out Chee Kung Fui Kon (Chinese: 致公會館; Jyutping: zi3 gung1 wui6 gun2), and the back containing the phrase (translated as) Everyone is equal.The main building was a rectangular, two-story structure approximately 55 feet (17 m) by 34 feet (10 m), with covered verandas on both floors. Architectural elements included shingled intersecting gabled roofs with gabled ends and fish-scaled shingles painted in various colors. Assorted other details included a scalloped archway, chamfered posts, decorative wheel and quatrefoil brackets, and an entrance gable with a carved bridgeboard. Diamonds and rectangles were also incorporated into the structure via ornamental lintels and balustrades.A trapezoid cinder block structure approximately 19 feet (5.8 m) by 32 feet (9.8 m) stood next to the building to the east. == Historic listings == The site was placed on the Hawaii State Register of Historic Places on July 30, 1982 and the National Register of Historic Places on November 15, 1982, but delisted in August 1998 from the State register; it is still listed in the NRHP database. == Current condition == Today, the site consists of only a few cement structures and several trees obscuring the front of the property. The gate and adjoining walls, stairs, sidewalks, foundation pillars, and the cinderblock addition lie in decrepit condition. The phrase Everyone is equal is barely discernible behind the lintel on the gate.As of 2010, a property listing sale noted additional details, including the lack of a water meter and possible building restrictions due to it being under the jurisdiction of a redevelopment authority. == Gallery == == References == == Further reading == Bartholomew, Gail, Bailey, Bren (June 1995).

As a child, Ørsted Pedersen played piano, but from the age of 13, he started learning to play upright bass and at the age of 14, while studying, he began his professional jazz career in Denmark with his first band, Jazzkvintet 60 (Danish for Jazz Quintet 60). By the age of fifteen, he had the ability to accompany leading musicians at nightclubs, working regularly at Copenhagen\\'s Jazzhus Montmartre, after his debut there on New Year\\'s Eve 1961, when he was only 15. When seventeen, he had already turned down an offer to join the Count Basie orchestra, mainly because he was too young to get legal permission to live and work as a musician in the United States. The Montmartre was a regular stop-off for touring American Jazz stars, and as a member of the house band, the young Ørsted Pedersen performed with saxophonists such as Sonny Rollins, Dexter Gordon, Rahsaan Roland Kirk and Stan Getz, and pianist Bill Evans, with whom he toured in Europe in 1965. During the 1960s, Pedersen played with a series of other important American jazzmen who were touring or resident in Denmark, including Ben Webster, Brew Moore, Bud Powell, Count Basie, Roy Eldridge, Dizzy Gillespie, Jackie McLean, and vocalist Ella Fitzgerald. He is perhaps best known for his extensive collaboration with Oscar Peterson from 1972 to 1987. His predecessor, Ray Brown, thought highly of the Dane and regarded him as the only upright bassist equal to the task of keeping up with the pianist. He was awarded Best Bass Player of the Year by DownBeat Critics\\' Poll in 1981.Ørsted Pedersen worked in duo and trio arrangements with pianist Kenny Drew, recording over 50 albums together. He also worked with Stéphane Grappelli and Joe Pass and recorded extensively as a leader. His best known songs are \"My Little Anna\", \"Jaywalkin\\'\", and \"The Puzzle\", as well as jazz arrangements of traditional Danish folk songs. A duo performance with Rune Gustafsson at Vossajazz 1980, concluded on the album Just The Way You Are on the label Sonet Gramofon, recorded half a year after this first meeting. He was awarded the Nordic Council Music Prize in 1991. Pedersen had a particular ability to interpret Danish songs and folk melodies. He often played within trio ensembles, partly collectively with the trumpeter Palle Mikkelborg and the keyboard player Kenneth Knudsen, and partly under his own name, usually with guitarists like Philip Catherine and Ulf Wakenius. In 1999, he co-led a duo with pianist Mulgrew Miller, touring Europe, Japan, Australia, and Korea. This format was later enlarged into a trio featuring drummer Alvin Queen. This trio remained intact until Pedersen\\'s death. == Death == Ørsted Pedersen died of heart failure in 2005 at the age of 58 in Copenhagen, Denmark.

              " 'Mário Juruna (September 3, 1942 or 1943 – July 18, 2002) was the first national-level federal representative in Brazil that belonged to an indigenous people. == Biography == He was born in Namurunjá village, near Barra do Garças, in the state of Mato Grosso, the son of the Xavante cacique (chief) Apoenã. He lived in the jungle, without contact with civilization, until the age of 17, when he became cacique. In the 1970s he became famous for walking the halls of FUNAI, in Brasilia to fight for land rights of Indians, while carrying a tape recorder, which he used to record everything that was said to him and to prove that the authorities, in most cases, did not keep their word. He was elected to the Chamber of Deputies of Brazil by the Democratic Labour Party from 1983–1987, representing Rio de Janeiro. His election had strong repercussions in Brazil and the world. He was responsible for the creation of a permanent commission for Indians, which brought formal recognition to issues related to Indians. In 1984, he denounced the businessman Calim Eid for having attempted to bribe him to vote for Paulo Maluf, the presidential candidate supported by the military regime then in power. He voted for Tancredo Neves, the democratic opposition candidate. He was not reelected in 1986, but he remained active in politics for several years. With his mandate ended, and abandoned by his tribe, he remained in Brasilia and died on July 18, 2002, due to complications from diabetes. == References == == Further reading == Conklin, Beth A. & Graham, Laura R. 1995. \"The Shifting Middle Ground\".

              " 'The harp is a stringed musical instrument that has a number of individual strings running at an angle to its soundboard; the strings are plucked with the fingers. Harps can be made and played in various ways, standing or sitting, and in orchestras or concerts. Its most common form is triangular in shape and made of wood. Some have multiple rows of strings and pedal attachments. Ancient depictions of harps were recorded in Current-day Iraq (Mesopotamia), Iran (Persia), and Egypt, and later in India and China. By medieval times harps had spread across Europe. Harps were found across the Americas where it was a popular folk tradition in some areas. Distinct designs also emerged from the African continent. Harps have symbolic political traditions and are often used in logos, including in Ireland. == History == Harps have been known since antiquity in Asia, Africa, and Europe, dating back at least as early as 3000 BCE. The instrument had great popularity in Europe during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, where it evolved into a wide range of variants with new technologies, and was disseminated to Europe\\'s colonies, finding particular popularity in Latin America. Although some ancient members of the harp family died out in the Near East and South Asia, descendants of early harps are still played in Myanmar and parts of Africa; other variants defunct in Europe and Asia have been used by folk musicians in the modern era. === Origin === ==== Middle East ==== The earliest harps and lyres were found in Sumer, 3500 BCE, and several harps were excavated from burial pits and royal tombs in Ur. The oldest depictions of harps without a forepillar can be seen adjacent to the Near East, in the wall paintings of ancient Egyptian tombs in the Nile Valley, which date from as early as 3000 BCE. These murals show an instrument that closely resembles the hunter\\'s bow, without the pillar that we find in modern harps. The Chang flourished in Persia in many forms from its introduction, about 4000 BCE, until the 17th century. Around 1900 BCE arched harps in the Iraq-Iran region were replaced by angular harps with vertical or horizontal sound boxes.By the start of the Common Era, \"robust, vertical, angular harps\", which had become predominant in the Hellenistic world, were cherished in the Sasanian court. In the last century of the Sasanian period, angular harps were redesigned to make them as light as possible (\"light, vertical, angular harps\"); while they became more elegant, they lost their structural rigidity. At the height of the Persian tradition of illustrated book production (1300–1600 CE), such light harps were still frequently depicted, although their use as musical instruments was reaching its end. ==== South Asia ==== Mesolithic era paintings from Bhimbetka show harp playing. An arched harp made of wooden brackets and metal strings is depicted on an Indus seal. The works of the Tamil Sangam literature describe the harp and its variants, as early as 200 BCE. Variants were described ranging from 14 to 17 strings, and the instrument used by wandering minstrels for accompaniment. Iconographic evidence of the yaal appears in temple statues dated as early as 600 BCE One of the Sangam works, the Kallaadam recounts how the first yaaḻ harp was inspired by an archer\\'s bow, when he heard the musical sound of its twang.Another early South Asian harp was the ancient veena, not to be confused with the modern Indian veena which is a type of lute. Some Samudragupta gold coins show of the mid-4th century CE show (presumably) the king Samudragupta himself playing the instrument. The ancient veena survives today in Burma, in the form of the saung harp still played there. ==== East Asia ==== The harp was popular in ancient China and neighboring regions, though harps are largely extinct in East Asia in the modern day. The Chinese konghou harp is documented as early as the Spring and Autumn period (770–476 BCE), and became extinct during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644 CE). A similar harp, the Gonghu was played in ancient Korea, documented as early as the Goguryeo period (37 BCE – 686 CE). === Development === ==== Europe ==== While the angle and bow harps held popularity elsewhere, European harps favored the \"pillar\", a third structural member to support the far ends of the arch and soundbox.: 290 A harp with a triangular three-part frame is depicted on 8th-century Pictish stones in Scotland: 290 and in manuscripts (e.g. the Utrecht Psalter) from early 9th-century France. The curve of the harp\\'s neck is a result of the proportional shortening of the basic triangular form to keep the strings equidistant; if the strings were proportionately distant they would be farther apart. As European harps evolved to play more complex music, a key consideration was some way to facilitate the quick changing of a string\\'s pitch to be able to play more chromatic notes. By the Baroque period in Italy and Spain, more strings were added to allow for chromatic notes in more complex harps. In Germany in the second half of the 17th century, diatonic single-row harps were fitted with manually turned hooks that fretted individual strings to raise their pitch by a half step. In the 18th century, a link mechanism was developed connecting these hooks with pedals, leading to the invention of the single-action pedal harp. The first primitive form of pedal harps was developed in the Tyrol region of Austria. Jacob Hochbrucker was the next to design an improved pedal mechanism around 1720, followed in succession by Krumpholtz, Naderman, and the Erard company, who came up with the double mechanism, in which a second row of hooks was installed along the neck, capable of raising the pitch of a string by either one or two half steps. While one course of European harps led to greater complexity, resulting largely in the modern pedal harp, other harping traditions maintained simpler diatonic instruments which survived and evolved into modern traditions. ==== Americas ==== In the Americas, harps are widely but sparsely distributed, except in certain regions where the harp traditions are very strong. Such important centeres include Mexico, the Andean region, Venezuela, and Paraguay. They are derived from the Baroque harps that were brought from Spain during the colonial period. Detailed features vary from place to place. The Paraguayan harp is that country\\'s national instrument, and has gained a worldwide reputation, with international influences alongside folk traditions. They have around 36 strings, are played with fingernails, and with a narrowing spacing and lower tension than modern Western harps, and have a wide and deep soundbox that tapers to the top.The harp is also found in Argentina, though in Uruguay it was largely displaced in religious music by the organ by the end of the 18th century. The harp is historically found in Brazil, but mostly in the south of the country. The Andean harp (Spanish/Quechua: arpa), also known as the Peruvian harp, or indigenous harp, is widespread among peoples living in the highlands of the Andes: Quechua and Aymara, mainly in Peru, and also in Bolivia and Ecuador. It is relatively large, with a significantly increased volume of the resonator box, which gives basses a special richness. It usually accompanies love dances and songs, such as huayno. One of the most famous performers on the Andean harp was Juan Cayambe (Pimampiro Canton, Imbabura Province, Ecuador) Mexican jarocha harp music of Veracruz has also gained some international recognition, evident in the popularity of \"La Bamba\". The arpa jarocha is typically played while standing. In southern Mexico (Chiapas), there is a very different indigenous style of harp music. The harp arrived in Venezuela with Spanish colonists. There are two distinct traditions: the arpa llanera (\\'harp of the Llanos’, or plains) and the arpa central (\\'of the central area\\'). By the 2020s, three types of harps are typically found: the traditional llanera harp, made of Cedar wood and has 32 strings, originally of the gut, but in modern times are of nylon. It is used to accompany both dancers and singers playing joropo music, a traditional form of Venezuelan music, also known as llanera music. the arpa central (also known as arpa mirandina \\'of Miranda State’, and arpa tuyera \\'of the Tuy Valleys’) is strung with wire in the higher register. the Venezuelan electric harp ==== Africa ==== A number of types of harps are found in Africa, predominantly not of the three-sided frame-harp type found in Europe. A number of these, referred to generically as African harps, are bow or angle harps, which lack forepillars joining the neck to the body. A number of harp-like instruments in Africa are not easily classified with European categories. Instruments like the West African kora and Mauritanian ardin are sometimes labeled as \"spike harp\", \"bridge harp\", or harp lute since their construction includes a bridge which holds the strings laterally, vice vertically entering the soundboard. ==== Middle East ==== While lyres and zithers have persisted in the Middle East, most of the true harps of the region have become extinct, though some are undergoing initial revivals. The Turkish çeng was a nine-string harp in the Ottoman Empire which became extinct at the end of the 17th century, but has undergone some revival and evolution since the late 20th century. A similar harp, the changi survives in the Svaneti region of Georgia. ==== South Asia ==== In India, the Bin-Baia harp survives about the Padhar people of Madhya Pradesh. The Kafir harp has been part of Nuristani musical tradition for many years. ==== East Asia ==== The harp largely became extinct in East Asia by the 17th century; around the year 1000, harps like the vajra began to replace prior harps. A few examples survived to the modern era, particularly Myanmar\\'s saung-gauk, which is considered the national instrument in that country. Though the ancient Chinese konghou has not been directly resurrected, the name has been revived and applied to a modern newly invented instrument based on the Western classical harp, but with the strings doubled back to form two notes per string, allowing advanced techniques such as note-bending. == Modern European and American harps == === Concert harp === The concert harp is a technologically advanced instrument, particularly distinguished by its use of \"pedals\", foot-controlled devices which can alter the pitch of given strings, making it fully chromatic and thus able to play a wide body of classical repertoire. The pedal harp contains seven pedals that each affect the tuning of all strings of one pitch-class. The pedals, from left to right, are D, C, B on the left side and E, F, G, A on the right. Pedals were first introduced in 1697 by Jakob Hochbrucker of Bavaria. In 1811 these were upgraded to the \"double action\" pedal system patented by Sébastien Erard. The addition of pedals broadened the harp\\'s abilities, allowing its gradual entry into the classical orchestra, largely beginning in the 19th century. The harp played little or no role in early classical music (being used only a handful of times by major composers such as Mozart and Beethoven), and its usage by Cesar Franck in his Symphony in D minor (1888) was described as \"revolutionary\" despite some body of prior classical usage. In the 20th century, the pedal harp found use outside of classical music, entering musical comedy films in 1929 with Arthur \"Harpo\" Marx, jazz with Casper Reardon in 1934, the Beatles 1967 single \"She\\'s Leaving Home\", and several works by Björk which featured harpist Zeena Parkins. In the early 1980s, Swiss harpist Andreas Vollenweider exposed the concert harp to large new audiences with his popular new age/jazz albums and concert performances. === Folk, lever, and Celtic instruments === In the modern era, there is a family of mid-size harps, generally with nylon strings, and optionally with partial or full levers but without pedals. They range from two to six octaves, and are plucked with the fingers using a similar technique to the pedal harp. Though these harps evoke ties to historical European harps, their specifics are modern, and they are frequently referred to broadly as \"Celtic harps\" due to their region of revival and popular association, or more generically as \"folk harps\" due to their use in non-classical music, or as \"lever harps\" to contrast their modifying mechanism with the larger pedal harp. The modern Celtic harp began to appear in the early 19th century in Ireland, contemporary with the dying-out of earlier forms of Gaelic harp. Dublin pedal harp maker John Egan developed a new type of harp which had gut strings and semitone mechanisms like an orchestral pedal harp; it was small and curved like the historical cláirseach or Irish harp, but its strings were of gut and the soundbox was much lighter. In the 1890s a similar new harp was also developed in Scotland as part of a Gaelic cultural revival. In the mid-20th century Jord Cochevelou developed a variant of the modern Celtic harp which he referred to as the \"Breton Celtic harp\"; his son Alan Stivell was to become the most influential Breton harper, and a strong influence in the broader world of the Celtic harp. === Multi-course harps === A multi-course harp is a harp with more than one row of strings, as opposed to the more common \"single course\" harp. On a double-harp, the two rows generally run parallel to each other, one on either side of the neck, and are usually both diatonic (sometimes with levers) with identical notes. The triple harp originated in Italy in the 16th century, and arrived in Wales in the late 17th century where it established itself in the local tradition as the Welsh harp (telyn deires, \"three-row harp\"). The triple consists of two outer rows of identical diatonic strings with a third set of chromatic strings between them. These strings are off set to permit the harpist to reach past the outer row and pluck an inner string if a chromatic note is needed. === Chromatic-strung harps === Some harps, rather than using pedal or lever devices, achieve chromaticity by simply adding additional strings to cover the notes outside their diatonic home scale. The Welsh triple harp is one such instrument, and two other instruments employing this technique are the cross-strung harp and the inline chromatic harp. The cross-strung harp has one row of diatonic strings, and a separate row of chromatic notes, angled in an \"X\" shape so that the row which can be played by the right hand at the top may be played by the left hand at the bottom, and vice versa. This variant was first attested as the arpa de dos órdenes (\"two-row harp\") in Spain and Portugal, in the 17th century.The inline chromatic harp is generally a single-course harp with all 12 notes of the chromatic scale appearing in a single row. Single course inline chromatic harps have been produced at least since 1902, when Karl Weigel of Hanover patented a model of inline chromatic harp. === Electric harps === Amplified (electro-acoustic) hollow body and solid body electric lever harps are produced by many harp makers, including Lyon & Healy, Salvi, and Camac. They generally use individual piezo-electric sensors for each string, often in combination with small internal microphones to produce a mixed electrical signal. Hollow body instruments can also be played acoustically, while solid body instruments must be amplified. The late-20th century Gravikord is a modern purpose-built electric double harp made of stainless steel based on the traditional West African kora. == Variations == Harps vary globally in many ways. In terms of size, many smaller harps can be played on the lap, whereas larger harps are quite heavy and rest on the floor. Different harps may use strings of catgut, nylon, metal, or some combination. All harps have a neck, resonator, and strings, frame harps or triangular harps have a pillar at their long end to support the strings, while open harps, such as arch harps and bow harps, do not. Modern harps also vary in techniques used to extend the range and chromaticism of the strings (e.g., adding sharps and flats). On lever harps one adjusts a string\\'s note mid-performance by flipping a lever, which shortens the string enough to raise the pitch by a chromatic sharp. On pedal harps depressing the pedal one step turns geared levers on the strings for all octaves of a single pitch; most allow a second step that turns a second set of levers. The pedal harp is a standard instrument in the orchestra of the Romantic music era (ca. 1800–1910 CE) and the 20th and 21st century music era. == Structure and mechanism == Harps are essentially triangular and made primarily of wood. Strings are made of gut or wire, often replaced in the modern day by nylon or metal. The top end of each string is secured on the crossbar or neck, where each will have a tuning peg or similar device to adjust the pitch. From the crossbar, the string runs down to the sounding board on the resonating body, where it is secured with a knot; on modern harps the string\\'s hole is protected with an eyelet to limit wear on the wood. The distance between the tuning peg and the soundboard, as well as tension and weight of the string, determine the pitch of the string. The body is hollow, and when a taut string is plucked, the body resonates, projecting sound. The longest side of the harp is called the column or pillar (though some earlier harps, such as a \"bow harp\", lack a pillar). On most harps the sole purpose of the pillar is to hold up the neck against the great strain of the strings. On harps which have pedals (largely the modern concert harp), the pillar is a hollow column and encloses the rods which adjust the pitches, which are levered by pressing pedals at the base of the instrument. On harps of earlier design, a single string produces only a single pitch unless it is retuned. In many cases this means such a harp can only play in one key at a time and must be retuned to play in another key. Harpers and luthiers have developed various remedies to this limitation: the addition of extra strings to cover chromatic notes (sometimes in separate or angled rows distinct from the main row of strings), addition of small levers on the crossbar which when actuated raise the pitch of a string by a set interval (usually a semitone), or use of pedals at the base of the instrument, pressed with the foot, which move additional small pegs on the crossbar. The small pegs gently contact the string near the tuning peg, changing the vibrating length, but not the tension, and hence the pitch of the string.These solutions increase the versatility of a harp at the cost of adding complexity, weight, and expense. == Terminology and etymology == The modern English word harp comes from the Old English hearpe; akin to Old High German harpha. A person who plays a pedal harp is called a \"harpist\"; a person who plays a folk-harp is called a \"harper\" or sometimes a \"harpist\"; either may be called a \"harp-player\", and the distinctions are not strict. A number of instruments that are not harps are none-the-less colloquially referred to as \"harps\". Chordophones like the aeolian harp (wind harp), the autoharp, the psaltery, as well as the piano and harpsichord, are not harps, but zithers, because their strings are parallel to their soundboard. Harps\\' strings rise approximately perpendicularly from the soundboard. Similarly, the many varieties of harp guitar and harp lute, while chordophones, belong to the lute family and are not true harps. All forms of the lyre and kithara are also not harps, but belong to the fourth family of ancient instruments under the chordophones, the lyres, closely related to the zither family. The term \"harp\" has also been applied to many instruments which are not even chordophones. The vibraphone was (and is still) sometimes referred to as the \"vibraharp\", though it has no strings and its sound is produced by striking metal bars. In blues music, the harmonica is often casually referred to as a \"blues harp\" or \"harp\", but it is a free reed wind instrument, not a stringed instrument, and is therefore not a true harp. The Jew\\'s harp is neither Jewish nor a harp; it is a plucked idiophone and likewise not a stringed instrument. The laser harp is not a stringed instrument at all, but is a harp-shaped electronic instrument controller that has laser beams where harps have strings. == As a symbol == === Political === ==== Ireland ==== The harp has been used as a political symbol of Ireland for centuries. Its origin is unknown but from the evidence of the ancient oral and written literature, it has been present in one form or another since at least the 6th century or before. According to tradition, Brian Boru, High King of Ireland (died at the Battle of Clontarf, 1014) played the harp, as did many of the gentry in the country during the period of the Gaelic Lordship of Ireland (ended c. 1607 with the Flight of the Earls following the Elizabethan Wars).In traditional Gaelic society every clan and chief of any consequence would have a resident harp player who would compose eulogies and elegies (later known as \"planxties\") in honour of the leader and chief men of the clan. The harp was adopted as a symbol of the Kingdom of Ireland on the coinage from 1542, and in the Royal Standard of King James VI and I in 1603 and continued to feature on all English and United Kingdom Royal Standards ever since, though the styles of the harps depicted differed in some respects. It was also used on the Commonwealth Jack of Oliver Cromwell, issued in 1649 and on the Protectorate Jack issued in 1658 as well as on the Lord Protector\\'s Standard issued on the succession of Richard Cromwell in 1658. The harp is also traditionally used on the flag of Leinster. Since 1922, the government of Ireland has used a similar left-facing harp, based on the Trinity College Harp in the Library of Trinity College Dublin as its state symbol. This design first appeared on the Great Seal of the Irish Free State, which in turn was replaced by the coat of arms, the Irish Presidential Standard and the Presidential Seal in the 1937 Constitution of Ireland. The harp emblem is used on official state seals and documents including the Irish passport and has appeared on Irish coinage from the Middle Ages to the current Irish imprints of euro coins. ==== Elsewhere ==== The South Asian Tamil harp yaal is the symbol of City of Jaffna, Sri Lanka, whose legendary root originates from a harp player.The arms of the Finnish city of Kangasala features a red, eagle-headed harp. === Religious === In the context of Christianity, heaven is sometimes symbolically depicted as populated by angels playing harps, giving the instrument associations of the sacred and heavenly. In the Bible, Genesis 4:21 says that Jubal, the first musician and son of Lamech, was \\'the father of all who play\\' the harp and flute.Many depictions of King David in Jewish art have him holding or playing a harp, such as a sculpture outside King David\\'s tomb in Jerusalem.\"King David statue at King David\\'s tomb\". Jerusalem.com. photo gallery. Jerusalem. === Corporate === The harp is also used extensively as a corporate logo, predominantly by companies that have, or wish to suggest, a connection with Ireland. The Irish brewer Guinness has used a right-facing harp (in contrast to the Irish State emblem’s left-facing version) as its emblem since 1759, the Harp Lager brand has done so since 1960. The Irish Independent newspaper has used a harp in its masthead since 1961. The Irish airline Ryanair, founded in 1985, also features a stylised harp in its logo. Other organisations in Ireland use the harp in their corporate identity, but not always prominently; these include the National University of Ireland and the associated University College Dublin, and the Gaelic Athletic Association. In Northern Ireland, the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Queen\\'s University of Belfast use the harp as part of their identity. === Sporting === In sport, the harp is used in the emblems of the League of Ireland football team Finn Harps F.C., Donegal\\'s senior soccer club. Outside of Ireland, it appears in the badge of the Scottish Premiership team Hibernian F.C. - a team originally founded by Irish emigrants. Not all sporting uses of the harp are references to Ireland, however: the Iraqi football club Al-Shorta has used a harp as its emblem since the early 1990s, after they gained the nickname Al-Qithara (Assyrian Neo-Aramaic: \"the harp\") when their style of play was likened to fine harp-playing by a television presenter. == See also == List of compositions for harp List of harpists Category:Harpists === Types of harp === Celtic harp, or Clàrsach, a modern replica of Medieval north European harps Claviharp, a 19th century instrument that combined a harp with a keyboard Epigonion, a 40 stringed instrument in ancient Greece thought to have been a harp Kantele, a traditional Finnish and Karelian zyther-like instrument Konghou, name shared by an ancient Chinese harp and a modern re-adaption Kora, a west-African folk-instrument, intermediate between a harp and a lute Lyre, kithara, zyther-like instruments used in Greek classical antiquity and later Pedal harp, the modern, chromatic concert harp Psaltery, a small, flat, lap instrument in the zither family Triple harp, a chromatic multi-course harp traditional in Wales == References == == Sources == Gaisford, Thomas (1848).

              " '\"In dir ist Freude\" (In You Is Joy) is a German hymn with text attributed to Cyriacus Schneegaß, written to a 1591 dance song melody by Giovanni Giacomo Gastoldi. It was first published in a collection of Christmas carols in Erfurt in 1594, and then published again in 1598. Johann Sebastian Bach composed a chorale prelude, BWV 615, as part of his Orgelbüchlein. The song is part of the common Protestant hymnal Evangelisches Gesangbuch, and of many hymnals and songbooks, including ecumenical collections. It was translated by Catherine Winkworth as \"In Thee Is Gladness\". == History == The text of \"In dir ist Freude\" is written to a secular melody. The tune by Giovanni Giacomo Gastoldi was first published in 1591, for an Italian dancing song, \"A lieta vita amor ci invita\" (Amor invites to a merry life) that has elements of song for entertainment. The text and melody of \"In dir ist Freude\" first appeared in Erfurt in Johann Lindemann\\'s 1594 collection of 20 Christmas carols. Lindemann published them in Erfurt in 1598. While the text was first attributed to Lindemann, it is unclear if he wrote any hymns, and it became later rather attributed to Cyriacus Schneegaß.It is contained in the modern Protestant hymnal Evangelisches Gesangbuch as EG 389, and is part of many hymnals and songbooks, including ecumenical collections. == Text == The text is in two stanzas of 16 short lines. Most lines have five syllables in always the same rhythm. Lines 3, 6, 11 and 16 are longer and rhyme, in an AAB CCB DDEEF GGHHF rhyme scheme. Lines 11 and 16 of each stanza end on \"Halleluja\". The text is based on Bible verses including Psalm 30:11–12 and Romans 8:38–39. The singer addresses Jesus as the source of joy in all distress.The hymn was translated by Catherine Winkworth as \"In Thee Is Gladness\" for the second edition of her Lyra Germanica (1858). It is part of the Lutheran Service Book, among other modern hymnals. == Melody and music == Gastoldi\\'s melody has been described as perfectly matching its expression of joy in the first line with its consolation of trust in Jesus during hard times.Johann Sebastian Bach composed a festive organ chorale prelude, BWV 615, as part of his Orgelbüchlein dating from his period at Weimar; the complete cantus firmus is gradually heard in canon, over a carillon-like ostinato pedal.

              " 'Liberty is the ability to do as one pleases, or a right or immunity enjoyed by prescription or by grant (i.e. privilege). It is a synonym for the word freedom. In modern politics, liberty is understood as the state of being free within society from control or oppressive restrictions imposed by authority on one\\'s way of life, behavior, or political views. In theology, liberty is freedom from the effects of \"sin, spiritual servitude, [or] worldly ties\".Sometimes liberty is differentiated from freedom by using the word \"freedom\" primarily, if not exclusively, to mean the ability to do as one wills and what one has the power to do; and using the word \"liberty\" to mean the absence of arbitrary restraints, taking into account the rights of all involved. In this sense, the exercise of liberty is subject to capability and limited by the rights of others. Thus liberty entails the responsible use of freedom under the rule of law without depriving anyone else of their freedom. Liberty can be taken away as a form of punishment. In many countries, people can be deprived of their liberty if they are convicted of criminal acts. Liberty originates from the Latin word libertas, derived from the name of the goddess Libertas, who, along with more modern personifications, is often used to portray the concept, and the archaic Roman god Liber. The word \"liberty\" is often used in slogans, such as in \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\" and \"Liberté, égalité, fraternité\". == Philosophy == Philosophers from the earliest times have considered the question of liberty. Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius (121–180 AD) wrote: a polity in which there is the same law for all, a polity administered with regard to equal rights and equal freedom of speech, and the idea of a kingly government which respects most of all the freedom of the governed. According to compatibilist Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679): a free man is he that in those things which by his strength and wit he is able to do is not hindered to do what he hath the will to do. John Locke (1632–1704) rejected that definition of liberty. While not specifically mentioning Hobbes, he attacks Sir Robert Filmer who had the same definition. According to Locke: In the state of nature, liberty consists of being free from any superior power on Earth. People are not under the will or lawmaking authority of others but have only the law of nature for their rule. In political society, liberty consists of being under no other lawmaking power except that established by consent in the commonwealth. People are free from the dominion of any will or legal restraint apart from that enacted by their own constituted lawmaking power according to the trust put in it. Thus, freedom is not as Sir Robert Filmer defines it: \\'A liberty for everyone to do what he likes, to live as he pleases, and not to be tied by any laws.\\' Freedom is constrained by laws in both the state of nature and political society. Freedom of nature is to be under no other restraint but the law of nature. Freedom of people under government is to be under no restraint apart from standing rules to live by that are common to everyone in the society and made by the lawmaking power established in it. Persons have a right or liberty to (1) follow their own will in all things that the law has not prohibited and (2) not be subject to the inconstant, uncertain, unknown, and arbitrary wills of others. John Stuart Mill (1806–1873), in his work, On Liberty, was the first to recognize the difference between liberty as the freedom to act and liberty as the absence of coercion.In his book Two Concepts of Liberty, Isaiah Berlin formally framed the differences between two perspectives as the distinction between two opposite concepts of liberty: positive liberty and negative liberty. The latter designates a negative condition in which an individual is protected from tyranny and the arbitrary exercise of authority, while the former refers to the liberty that comes from self-mastery, the freedom from inner compulsions such as weakness and fear. == Politics == === History === The modern concept of political liberty has its origins in the Greek concepts of freedom and slavery. To be free, to the Greeks, was not to have a master, to be independent from a master (to live as one likes). That was the original Greek concept of freedom. It is closely linked with the concept of democracy, as Aristotle put it: \"This, then, is one note of liberty which all democrats affirm to be the principle of their state. Another is that a man should live as he likes. This, they say, is the privilege of a freeman, since, on the other hand, not to live as a man likes is the mark of a slave. This is the second characteristic of democracy, whence has arisen the claim of men to be ruled by none, if possible, or, if this is impossible, to rule and be ruled in turns; and so it contributes to the freedom based upon equality.\"This applied only to free men. In Athens, for instance, women could not vote or hold office and were legally and socially dependent on a male relative.The populations of the Persian Empire enjoyed some degree of freedom. Citizens of all religions and ethnic groups were given the same rights and had the same freedom of religion, women had the same rights as men, and slavery was abolished (550 BC). All the palaces of the kings of Persia were built by paid workers in an era when slaves typically did such work.In the Maurya Empire of ancient India, citizens of all religions and ethnic groups had some rights to freedom, tolerance, and equality. The need for tolerance on an egalitarian basis can be found in the Edicts of Ashoka the Great, which emphasize the importance of tolerance in public policy by the government. The slaughter or capture of prisoners of war also appears to have been condemned by Ashoka. Slavery also appears to have been non-existent in the Maurya Empire. However, according to Hermann Kulke and Dietmar Rothermund, \"Ashoka\\'s orders seem to have been resisted right from the beginning.\"Roman law also embraced certain limited forms of liberty, even under the rule of the Roman Emperors. However, these liberties were accorded only to Roman citizens. Many of the liberties enjoyed under Roman law endured through the Middle Ages, but were enjoyed solely by the nobility, rarely by the common man. The idea of inalienable and universal liberties had to wait until the Age of Enlightenment. === Social contract === The social contract theory, most influentially formulated by Hobbes, John Locke and Rousseau (though first suggested by Plato in The Republic), was among the first to provide a political classification of rights, in particular through the notion of sovereignty and of natural rights. The thinkers of the Enlightenment reasoned that law governed both heavenly and human affairs, and that law gave the king his power, rather than the king\\'s power giving force to law. This conception of law would find its culmination in the ideas of Montesquieu. The conception of law as a relationship between individuals, rather than families, came to the fore, and with it the increasing focus on individual liberty as a fundamental reality, given by \"Nature and Nature\\'s God,\" which, in the ideal state, would be as universal as possible. In On Liberty, John Stuart Mill sought to define the \"...nature and limits of the power which can be legitimately exercised by society over the individual,\" and as such, he describes an inherent and continuous antagonism between liberty and authority and thus, the prevailing question becomes \"how to make the fitting adjustment between individual independence and social control\". == Origins of political freedom == === England and Great Britain === Timeline: 1066 – as a condition of his coronation William the Conqueror assented to the London Charter of Liberties which guaranteed the \"Saxon\" liberties of the City of London. 1100 – the Charter of Liberties is passed which sets out certain liberties of nobles, church officials and individuals. 1166 – Henry II of England transformed English law by passing the Assize of Clarendon. The act, a forerunner to trial by jury, started the abolition of trial by combat and trial by ordeal. 1187-1189 – publication of Tractatus de legibus et consuetudinibus regni Anglie which contains authoritative definitions of freedom and servitude. 1215 – Magna Carta was enacted, becoming the cornerstone of liberty in first England, then Great Britain, and later the world. 1628 – the English Parliament passed the Petition of Right which set out specific liberties of English subjects. 1679 – the English Parliament passed the Habeas Corpus Act which outlawed unlawful or arbitrary imprisonment. 1689 – the Bill of Rights granted \"freedom of speech in Parliament\", and reinforced many existing civil rights in England. The Scots law equivalent the Claim of Right is also passed. 1772 – the Somerset v Stewart judgement found that slavery was unsupported by common law in England and Wales. 1859 – an essay by the philosopher John Stuart Mill, entitled On Liberty, argued for toleration and individuality. \"If any opinion is compelled to silence, that opinion may, for aught we can certainly know, be true. To deny this is to assume our own infallibility.\" 1948 – British representatives attempted to but were prevented from adding a legal framework to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. (It was not until 1976 that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights came into force, giving a legal status to most of the Declaration.) 1958 – Two Concepts of Liberty, by Isaiah Berlin, identified \"negative liberty\" as an obstacle, as distinct from \"positive liberty\" which promotes self-mastery and the concepts of freedom. === United States === According to the 1776 United States Declaration of Independence, all people have a natural right to \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\". But this declaration of liberty was troubled from the outset by the institutionalization of legalized Black slavery. Slave owners argued that their liberty was paramount since it involved property, their slaves, and that Blacks had no rights that any White man was obliged to recognize. The Supreme Court, in the Dred Scott decision, upheld this principle. It was not until 1866, following the Civil War, that the US Constitution was amended to extend limited rights to persons of color, and not until 1920 that voting rights were extended to women.By the later half of the 20th century, liberty was expanded further to prohibit government interference with personal choices. In the United States Supreme Court decision Griswold v. Connecticut, Justice William O. Douglas argued that liberties relating to personal relationships, such as marriage, have a unique primacy of place in the hierarchy of freedoms. Jacob M. Appel has summarized this principle: I am grateful that I have rights in the proverbial public square – but, as a practical matter, my most cherished rights are those that I possess in my bedroom and hospital room and death chamber. Most people are far more concerned that they can control their own bodies than they are about petitioning Congress. In modern America, various competing ideologies have divergent views about how best to promote liberty. Liberals in the original sense of the word see equality as a necessary component of freedom. Progressives stress freedom from business monopoly as essential. Right-wing libertarians disagree, and see economic and individual freedom as best. The Tea Party movement sees the \"big government\" as the enemy of freedom. Other major participants in the modern American right-wing libertarian movement include the Libertarian Party, the Free State Project, and the Mises Institute. === France === France supported the Americans in their revolt against English rule and, in 1789, overthrew their own monarchy, with the cry of \"Liberté, égalité, fraternité\". The bloodbath that followed, known as the reign of terror, soured many people on the idea of liberty. Edmund Burke, considered one of the fathers of conservatism, wrote \"The French had shewn themselves the ablest architects of ruin that had hitherto existed in the world.\" == Ideologies == === Liberalism === According to the Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics, liberalism is \"the belief that it is the aim of politics to preserve individual rights and to maximize freedom of choice\". But they point out that there is considerable discussion about how to achieve those goals. Every discussion of freedom depends on three key components: who is free, what they are free to do, and what forces restrict their freedom. John Gray argues that the core belief of liberalism is toleration. Liberals allow others freedom to do what they want, in exchange for having the same freedom in return. This idea of freedom is personal rather than political. William Safire points out that liberalism is attacked by both the Right and the Left: by the Right for defending such practices as abortion, homosexuality, and atheism, and by the Left for defending free enterprise and the rights of the individual over the collective. === Libertarianism === According to the Encyclopædia Britannica, libertarians hold liberty as their primary political value. Their approach to implementing liberty involves opposing any governmental coercion, aside from that which is necessary to prevent individuals from coercing each other.Libertarianism is guided by the principle commonly known as the Non-Aggression Principle (NAP). The Non-Aggression Principle asserts that aggression against an individual or an individual\\'s property is always an immoral violation of one\\'s life, liberty, and property rights. Utilizing deceit instead of consent to achieve ends is also a violation of the Non-Aggression principle. Therefore, under the framework of the Non-Aggression principle, rape, murder, deception, involuntary taxation, government regulation, and other behaviors that initiate aggression against otherwise peaceful individuals are considered violations of this principle. This principle is most commonly adhered to by libertarians. A common elevator pitch for this principle is, \"Good ideas don\\'t require force.\" === Republican liberty === According to republican theorists of freedom, like the historian Quentin Skinner or the philosopher Philip Pettit, one\\'s liberty should not be viewed as the absence of interference in one\\'s actions, but as non-domination. According to this view, which originates in the Roman Digest, to be a liber homo, a free man, means not being subject to another\\'s arbitrary will, that is to say, dominated by another. They also cite Machiavelli who asserted that you must be a member of a free self-governing civil association, a republic, if you are to enjoy individual liberty.The predominance of this view of liberty among parliamentarians during the English Civil War resulted in the creation of the liberal concept of freedom as non-interference in Thomas Hobbes\\' Leviathan. === Socialism === Socialists view freedom as a concrete situation as opposed to a purely abstract ideal. Freedom is a state of being where individuals have agency to pursue their creative interests unhindered by coercive social relationships, specifically those they are forced to engage in as a requisite for survival under a given social system. Freedom thus requires both the material economic conditions that make freedom possible alongside social relationships and institutions conducive to freedom.The socialist conception of freedom is closely related to the socialist view of creativity and individuality. Influenced by Karl Marx\\'s concept of alienated labor, socialists understand freedom to be the ability for an individual to engage in creative work in the absence of alienation, where \"alienated labor\" refers to work people are forced to perform and un-alienated work refers to individuals pursuing their own creative interests. ==== Marxism ==== For Karl Marx, meaningful freedom is only attainable in a communist society characterized by superabundance and free access. Such a social arrangement would eliminate the need for alienated labor and enable individuals to pursue their own creative interests, leaving them to develop and maximize their full potentialities. This goes alongside Marx\\'s emphasis on the ability of socialism and communism progressively reducing the average length of the workday to expand the \"realm of freedom\", or discretionary free time, for each person. Marx\\'s notion of communist society and human freedom is thus radically individualistic. === Anarchism === While many anarchists see freedom slightly differently, all oppose authority, including the authority of the state, of capitalism, and of nationalism. For the Russian revolutionary anarchist Mikhail Bakunin, liberty did not mean an abstract ideal but a concrete reality based on the equal liberty of others. In a positive sense, liberty consists of \"the fullest development of all the faculties and powers of every human being, by education, by scientific training, and by material prosperity.\" Such a conception of liberty is \"eminently social, because it can only be realized in society,\" not in isolation. In a negative sense, liberty is \"the revolt of the individual against all divine, collective, and individual authority.\" == Historical writings on liberty == John Locke (1689).

              " 'Bagh District (Urdu: ضلع باغ) is one of the ten districts of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan. Previously part of Poonch District, it was established as a separate district in 1988.The Bagh District is bounded on the north by the Muzaffarabad District, the Hattian Bala District, and the Baramulla District of Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir, on the east by the Haveli District, on the south by the Poonch District, and on the west by the Rawalpindi District of Pakistan\\'s Punjab Province. The total area of the district is 770 square kilometers. The Bagh District is linked to the Muzaffarabad District by two roads, one via Sudhan Gali (80 km) and the other via Kohala (97 km). The district headquarters is the city of Bagh, which is situated 46 km from Rawalakot. It is said that a bagh (garden) was set up by a landowner where the premises of the Forest Department are now located. As a result, the area that is now the district headquarters was named \"Bagh\". == History == There is an archaeological site in the Bagh District called Bagh Fort.Prior to 1947, Bagh was a tehsil in the Poonch District of Jammu and Kashmir. == Administrative divisions == The district of Bagh is subdivided into 5 tehsils: Bagh Tehsil Dhirkot Tehsil Hari Ghel Tehsil Rera Tehsil Birpani Tehsil == Geography == Topographically, the entire Bagh District is a mountainous area, generally sloping from north-east to south-west. The area is part of the Lesser Himalayas zone. The main mountain range in the district is the Pir Panjal. The Haji-Pir Pass is situated at a height of 3421 meters above sea level. The general elevation is between 1500 and 2500 meters above sea level. The mountains are generally covered with coniferous forests. The main river in the district is the Mahl Nala, but numerous other rivulets also flow in the district. == Climate == The climate of the district varies with altitude. The temperature generally remains between 2 °C and 40 °C. The main eastern part of the district is very cold in the winter and moderate in the summer. However, the lower valleys, the localities bordering Bagh at Kohala and its adjoining areas (Mongbajri and Ajra-Bagh) remain cold in the winter and hot in the summer. May, June, and July are the hottest months. The maximum and minimum temperatures during the month of June are about 40 °C and 22 °C, respectively. December, January, and February are the coldest months. The maximum temperature in January is about 16 °C, and the minimum temperature is 3 °C. Annual rainfall is about 1,500 millimetres (59 in). == Demography == The total population of the district according to the 2017 census is 371,919.The main language of the district is Pahari, which is estimated to be native to around 95% of the inhabitants. The Pahari dialect spoken in Bagh is closely related to the dialect spoken to the north in the Muzaffarabad (84% shared basic vocabulary) and to the core Pahari varieties spoken to the south-west in the Galyat region around Murree (86–88%). There are also small groups of speakers of Gujari and Kashmiri. == Education == According to the Pakistan District Education Ranking 2017, a report by Alif Ailaan, the Bagh District is ranked at number 5 nationally in the ranking related to education, with an education score of 73.99. The learning score is at 85.42, with a gender parity score of 88.32.The school infrastructure score of the Bagh District is 28.32, giving Bagh a national rank of 126. School infrastructure is a major problem in all of Azad Kashmir. Access to schools, with schools being far away, is the primary reason why there are fewer enrollments after the completion of primary school. == 2005 earthquake == The city of Bagh, like other areas of the district, was heavily damaged in the 2005 Kashmir earthquake. Sixty percent of the buildings collapsed. Thousands of people died, and many more found themselves homeless. In the aftermath of the earthquake, NATO sent specialists to the district to help with clearing and reconstruction. There was a report that an entire village in the district had been wiped out. The United States government, through Pakistan, distributed vouchers to people in the district so that they could buy food and water. == References == == External links == Bagh Azad Jammu and Kashmir Official Portal District Profile – Bagh Earthquake Reconstruction & Rehabilitation Authority (ERRA) 2007',\n",

              " 'Broadway station is a Caltrain station in Burlingame, California. Caltrain only serves the stop on weekends and holidays; weekday service is provided by a bus shuttle to nearby Millbrae station. == History == A station in north Burlingame was opened around 1911, and renamed to Buri Buri in 1917, then Broadway in 1926. The former Southern Pacific Railroad depot building at Broadway still stands and used as a restaurant. A lightly-used station at nearby Easton (which existed as a separate town from 1906 to 1910) was in service until at least 1925. The San Francisco Municipal Railway 40 San Mateo interurban, originally operated by United Railroads of San Francisco, served passengers at the station from their line on what became California Drive: 32 until the service ceased in 1949. Like most stations on the corridor, the Southern Pacific built Broadway with a side platform on the west track for southbound trains, and a narrow island platform between the tracks for northbound trains. Because of the narrow center platform for northbound passengers, a hold-out rule is in effect at the station: if a train is stopped for passengers, an approaching train in the opposite direction on the other track must wait outside the station. The resulting delays were the main reason that Broadway became a weekend-only station on August 1, 2005, shortly after the Caltrain Express project was completed. A free shuttle to Millbrae station was implemented in lieu of weekday service. === Future plans === After the electrification of Caltrain is completed, daily service is planned to be reinstated at Broadway. The nearby level grade crossing at Broadway Avenue is planned to be grade-separated, with construction projected to start as early as 2025 if funding can be identified. The at-grade crossing has been identified as the second-most necessary grade separation among 10,000 at-grade crossings in California because it handles 70,000 vehicles per day, and city officials state it is the site of the worst traffic congestion in Burlingame. Grade separation is projected to cost $250 million. Plans for a grade separation started in 1965 when the Peninsula Commute was being operated by the Southern Pacific Railroad, but were stymied by the complex geometry of Broadway, which intersects with roads immediately east (Carolan) and west (California) of the level crossing, and (further east) passes over U.S. 101 at an interchange rebuilt in 2017, and the heavy rail traffic, projected at more than 114 trains per day by 2020. Traffic through the actual grade crossing was estimated at 27,000 vehicles per day in 2015.: 1–2 There are an average of two accidents and 105 traffic citations issued each year resulting from traffic stopped on the tracks.Seven alternatives (including a no-build option preserving the current layout) were studied in the Broadway Grade Separation Project Study Report, which recommended Alternative A, a combination of partially elevating the rail line for 7,300 feet (2,200 m) and partially depressing the roadway for a length of 730 feet (220 m), resulting in acceptable grades of up to 4.8 percent for road traffic and 0.75 percent for rail traffic.: 12–14 Under Alternative A, shoofly tracks would first be constructed east of the existing line and west of Carolan, then rail traffic would be diverted while the existing line was elevated. After the new rail bridge and embankments were completed, rail traffic would shift back to the newly elevated original alignment and Broadway would be temporarily closed while being reconstructed at a depressed alignment.: 15–16 Alternatives with the rail line lowered were considered, but they were rejected because of the high cost of drainage due to three nearby creeks.: 21 Broadway station would be rebuilt with an island platform to remove the existing hold-out rule. A preliminary design for the grade separation and station rebuild was anticipated for Spring 2019, and ultimately completed in October 2020 along with environmental clearance. The project is forecast to finish construction by summer of 2027. == References == == External links == Caltrain - Broadway Broadway Grade Separation (City of Burlingame) Burlingame Broadway Grade Separation Project (Caltrain)',\n",
              " 'Jack of Hearts (Jack Hart) is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character first appeared in The Deadly Hands of Kung Fu #22 (March 1976), and was created by writer Bill Mantlo and artist Keith Giffen. He starred in his own four-issue mini series and has been a regular character in the Iron Man comics as well as at one point being a regular in The Avengers comic book. Jack of Hearts, real name Jack Hart, is the son of scientist Philip Hart (creator of \"Zero Fluid\") and an alien woman from the Contraxian race. As a young man Jack was doused in Zero Fluid and gained super powers but was not in total control of his powers. In an attempt to control his powers, Jack of Hearts built a containment suit that resembled the Jack of Hearts playing card. The lack of control became a recurring theme with Jack of Hearts, including his stint in the Avengers where he had to spend 14 hours a day in a containment room to prevent self-destruction. When his powers became uncontrollable he chose to leave Earth, exploding in space without harming any innocent bystanders. The return of Jack of Hearts and the explosion that killed Scott Lang was the launching point of the 2004-05 \"Avengers Disassembled\". The character was resurrected as part of one of the Marvel Zombies mini-series where Zero Energy reforms into Jack of Hearts, bringing the character back to life. The Zombies were later defeated with the help of Jack of Hearts. == Publication history == Jack of Hearts first appeared in the black & white magazine The Deadly Hands of Kung Fu #22 (March 1976), and was created by writer Bill Mantlo and illustrator Keith Giffen. He was presented as an antagonist for the superhero White Tiger but his origin story in the following issue established him as a hero. His debut appearance in a color comic book was in The Incredible Hulk vol. 2 #214 (Aug. 1977) where he fights the Hulk. He later serves a brief stint as an ally and apprentice of Iron Man, becoming a regular cast member of the series during Mantlo\\'s tenure as writer. Jack has made various guest appearances in several books over the years, including Marvel Two-In-One, The Defenders, Marvel Premiere, (in a solo story meant to launch the character in his own series) ROM, and Marvel Team-Up, (which served as an intro to his 1984 mini-series) among others. He starred in his own self-titled, four issue limited series from Jan. to April 1984.He was later made a regular in The Avengers by writer Kurt Busiek, who explained, \"I first ran into Jack in The Deadly Hands of Kung Fu in an issue drawn by Gil Kane and Rico Rival. That great overcomplicated costume and the energy that Gil put into the storytelling hooked me, and I’ve been a fan ever since\". == Fictional character biography == === Early life === Jack Hart was born in New Haven, Connecticut. He is the son of Philip Hart, a scientist who created an energy source called \"zero fluid\", and Marie, an alien humanoid woman of the Contraxian race. After being exposed to a vat of zero fluid, Jack underwent a mutagenic change and gained the ability to project concussive energy from his body. After gaining these powers, Jack began his mission of vengeance against the Corporation that killed his father. This led to Jack fighting other superheroes such as the Sons of the Tiger and the Hulk. He also fought the White Tiger. Eventually, he killed Stryke, his father\\'s killer.Later, Jack mistakenly fought Iron Man. Being new to super-heroics, he asked Iron Man to take him on as an apprentice, which he did, to show him the ropes. Jack teamed with Iron Man, Nick Fury, Guardsman, Jasper Sitwell, Jean DeWolff, and the Wraith, and battled Midas. Jack was briefly turned to a golden living statue by Midas, and then freed from this golden state by Iron Man and Yellowjacket. Jack then aided Iron Man in fighting the Soviet Super-Soldiers on the moon. Jack aided Iron Man against the Rigellian Commander Arcturus. Jack later went off on his own, and fought Hemlock. === Being a Hero === Later, Jack moved past his mission of blind vengeance and became a true hero, working with various other superheroes such as the Defenders. Jack fought the Thing, who was under mental control of the Machinesmith. Jack Hart was then reunited with a college girlfriend named Marcy Kane (who was also a fellow graduate student of Peter Parker, a.k.a. Spider-Man). Marcy, a scientist, and S.H.I.E.L.D. offered to help find a cure for Jack\\'s dangerous super powers. Jack fought some S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, and his powers were temporarily dampened by Spider-Man. Marcy turned out to be a Contraxian agent sent to Earth to find Jack. It was at this time Jack learned of his half-Contraxian heritage. Marcy took Jack to Contraxia, where he discovered that his powers had become much stronger, and saved the home-world of his mother by reenergizing its dying sun. The Contraxians could not find a solution for Jack\\'s unstable powers, and he left Contraxia to wander outer space in exile.While wandering space he was captured by the Stranger. He later escaped captivity on the Stranger\\'s planet. Jack fought Quasar during his return to Earth; however, Jack exploded when his containment suit was breached in battle with the Presence. Jack was retrieved from space, revived and mentally controlled by Moondragon, and he attacked Kismet. The damage to his armor led Jack to seek aid from the Silver Surfer, who found an alien armorer on Anvil who designed a new containment suit for Jack. Jack then battled Nebula and Geatar. Shortly after this adventure, Jack fell in love with the alien warrior woman known as Ganymede, though she did not return his feelings. In an effort to save R-76, an outpost manned by the Rigellians, Jack of Hearts was injured in battle with the Servitors. Jack was rescued by a team of Avengers, and succeeded in convincing the Infinites to restore R-76. Subsequently, Jack and these Avengers were captured, first by the Shi\\'Ar, and then by the Ruul acting under the orders of the Supreme Intelligence. Jack and the Avengers eventually escaped to Earth and helped reverse a plan to have Earth consumed by Ego the Living Planet.Jack\\'s return to Earth happened during the period known as the Kang War, and Jack of Hearts was accepted as a member of the Avengers, becoming the fifty-second superhero to join the team, though the traditional welcoming ceremony for new Avengers were deferred given the nature of the crisis they faced. During his tenure, the Avengers teamed-up with the Justice League of America, and fought the Red Skull for unleashing a biological weapon at Mount Rushmore, killing many civilians. === Death === When his power levels began to increase beyond the capacity for his containment suit, Jack of Hearts chose to commit suicide rather than continue living in an isolated containment room for 14 hours a day. Jack took a child murderer who had abducted Cassandra Lang, the daughter of Scott Lang (the second Ant-Man), along with him when he exploded in space. With his uniform destroyed in the blast, the naked body of Jack of Hearts drifted deeper into space. === Avengers Disassembled === At the onset of the \"Avengers Disassembled\" event, Jack reappeared in uniform as what appeared to be a zombie just long enough to blow himself up, killing Scott Lang and destroying half of the Avengers Mansion. Jack\\'s return was caused by the reality-shifting powers of the Scarlet Witch through methods that have remained ambiguous. Unlike his prior explosion in space, Jack\\'s body was never recovered from the ruins. === Afterlife === During the adventures of Hercules in Hades, Jack can be seen playing slots to win a chance to return to the living. This is not the intended way the afterlife should operate, according to the characters. Jack wins, and excitedly declares that he is next for resurrection. === The Children\\'s Crusade === Iron Lad (the young Kang the Conqueror) transports the Young Avengers and the amnesiac Wanda, no longer the Scarlet Witch, back to the onset of the \"Avengers Disassembled\" when Jack had been used as a weapon to destroy the Avengers. While there they discovered that he was actually the real Jack of Hearts, summoned by Scarlet Witch. Undead and quite miserable, Jack pleads with Wanda not to go through with her monstrous plan, unaware that he is facing a different Wanda. The pity of this and the horror of seeing Jack blow himself up, shocks Wanda into recovering her memory—and therefore her powers. As an unexpected side effect, the life of Scott Lang is also saved, as the Young Avengers take Scott back to the future with them when they depart, thus saving his life while preserving the timeline as everyone still \\'saw\\' him \\'die\\' in the explosion. Jack\\'s last words before exploding were, \"I\\'m sorry.\" === Marvel Zombies Supreme and resurrection === Jack Hart returned to life once more in the second issue of the Marvel Zombies Supreme mini-series. While defending scientists at Project Pegasus, (which has been besieged by zombiefied clones of the Squadron Supreme) a team of special operatives led by Jill Harper and the superhero known as Battlestar came across a source of zero-point energy which Harper believed could help them stop the zombies. The zero-point energy unexpectedly reformed itself into corporeal form as Jack, who returned to life wearing his original suit for unexplained reasons. Harper managed to revive Jack, who was temporarily amnesiac and fainting from the stress of becoming human again. Although initially weakened, Jack quickly regained control of his powers and assessed the situation. Using his powers, Jack destroyed the zombies and saved Harper\\'s life after she became infected with the zombie virus. Afterwards, the two shared a romantic kiss.Jack Hart was absent for some time, but eventually returned to a more public life when he literally crashed into the apartment of Jennifer Walters (She-Hulk), and found that he was now able to eat, drink, and sleep normally for the first time since his accident. As Jack regained his powers, he and Jen became romantically involved, Jack assisting Jen in the Reckoning War conflict as they aided the Fantastic Four. == Powers and abilities == Jack Hart\\'s superhuman powers are as a result of the mutagenic effect of his father\\'s \"Zero Fluid\", combined with the alien genes from his Contraxian mother. He has superhuman stamina and durability. Jack of Hearts also has the ability to generate \"zero energy\" within his body and project it as concussive force or intense heat or as a propellant to fly. Jack is sometimes unable to exert complete control over his energies, however. For a short time after restarting Contraxia\\'s sun, he uncontrollably radiated enough heat to melt one of Contraxia\\'s polar ice caps. He can survive unprotected in space. Jack of Hearts\\'s brain has incorporated the artificial intelligence of a computerized device called the Scanalyzer, enabling him to think with the speed of a computer and store and retrieve information with a computer-like capacity and efficiency. The left half of Jack of Hearts\\' body has turned purplish-black from direct exposure to \"Zero Fluid\". Jack of Hearts\\' left eye has an opaque white membrane covering the entire pupil. These mutations were not solely caused by exposure to the \"Zero Fluid\", but are actually aspects of his half-Contraxian genetics brought to the fore, as Contraxians naturally have such appearances.Jack originally wore a suit of armor crafted in medieval Europe. His second suit of armor was designed by Torval, and made from alien materials designed to contain the zero energy his body generates. His original suit of armor was later restored and upgraded by Moondragon after Jack was rescued from space by the Avengers and thus leading to his connection with the team.Jack is a fair hand-to-hand combatant, has had some S.H.I.E.L.D. combat training, and is a talented poet. == In other media == In the Silver Surfer TV series, Jack of Hearts is seen as part of Nebula\\'s crew. == References == == External links == Jack of Hearts (Marvel Comics) at the Marvel Universe wiki Jack of Hearts on Marvel Database, a Marvel Comics wiki',\n",
              " 'Vivek Maru is an American social entrepreneur and human rights activist who is a pioneer in the field of legal empowerment. He is currently the CEO of Namati, which he founded in 2011. Namati and its partners have supported cadres of grassroots legal advocates – sometimes known as \"barefoot lawyers\" or \"community paralegals\"– in ten countries. These advocates equip their communities to protect common lands, enforce environmental law, and secure basic rights to healthcare and citizenship.In a 2014 article, Maru complained that \"when world governments adopted development goals 15 years ago, law and justice were left out.\" As a result, while major progress has been made in the fields of health, education, and the reduction of poverty, access to law and justice has lagged behind. He asserted that all people should have the right to information about the laws and institutions they live under, the right to a legal identity, the right to have their property ownership respected, the right to participate in the shaping of laws and policies, and the right to a fair legal resolution of problems and conflicts. == Early life and education == Maru\\'s parents were immigrants from India; his grandfather was a Gandhian who ran a small printing press.Maru attended Harvard College from 1993–97, receiving an A.B. in Social Studies. He graduated magna cum laude, was a member of Phi Beta Kappa, and was Class Marshal. His thesis was entitled \"Mohandas, Martin, and Malcolm on Violence, Culture and Meaning.\" From August 1997 to August 1998, he was a Frederick Sheldon Fellow at the Harvard University Extension School in western India, where he worked with grassroots rural-development organizations, taught classes, trained teachers, designed a curriculum, and conducted research. He lived in \"a hut made of sticks and dung amid the poverty and pollution of India\\'s Kutch region, from which his grandfather came.\" He \"worked with grassroots organizations on watershed management and education for girls.\"He attended Yale Law School from 1998 to 2001, receiving a Doctor of Law (JD). According to the ABA Journal, Maru nearly quit law school \"because it wasn\\'t presenting him with a Gandhian approach\" to legal work. At Yale he was co-founder and director of the Umoja Education Program and a fellow of the Schell Center for Human Rights. He was also a Founding Team Member of the Amistad Academy Charter School. == Career == From August 2001 to August 2002, Maru served as law clerk for Federal Appellate Judge Marsha Berzon of the Ninth Circuit of Appeals in the San Francisco Bay Area. Based in New York City, he was a Finberg Fellow at Human Rights Watch from September 2002 to September 2003.After Maru was invited by a friend, Simeon Koroma, to help Sierra Leone in the wake of its civil war, they co-founded Timap for Justice, which developed a nationwide network of paralegals at a time when there were only about 100 lawyers in the entire country, almost all of them in Freetown. \"Paralegals working and living in the community can squeeze a lot of justice out of the system,\" Maru explained. Maru directed Timap from October 2003 to October 2007. During the same period he was also co-director of the Fourah Bay Human Rights Clinic in Freetown. In addition, he was a Sierra Leone-based consultant for the World Bank for four months in 2007. Based in Washington, D.C., he was senior counsel for the World Bank\\'s Justice Reform Group from November 2007 to August 2011, and director of the World Bank Justice for the Poor Program in Sierra Leone. During this period he directed a program on community paralegals in Indonesia, Philippines, South Africa, Kenya, and Sierra Leone, and created a global \"Grassroots Justice Network\" to link these programs. He also developed the World Bank\\'s first global strategy for justice reform. He is now CEO of Namati: Innovations in Legal Empowerment, which he founded in August 2011. It is an international organization that seeks to build a movement of grassroots legal advocates. Namati has 186 paralegals in Kenya, Liberia, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, Uganda, Bangladesh, India, and Myanmar, who are part of a legal-empowerment network involving some 1,000 organizations. Matt Brown, a member of Namati\\'s board, has said that \"Vivek and Namati are creating a new field of legal empowerment.\" The organization has received support from the British and Australian governments, the United Nations Development Program, and other funders. He called the organization Namati, a Sanskrit word meaning to shape something into a curve, because of Martin Luther King Jr.\\'s statement that the \"arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.\"Ashoka has distinguished Namati from other such efforts to provide community justice. While previous groups have worked alone and on a relatively small scale, have rarely documented the impact of their work, and haven\\'t been in a position to learn lessons from the results of one another\\'s work, Namati is a larger-scale activity that places emphasis on documenting its results and on enabling workers in the field to learn from one another about best practices. In 2014, Namati helped 700 Nubians in Kenya to acquire citizenship rights, resolves health-care problems in Sierra Leone and Mozambique, helped resolve violations of environmental law along the Indian coast, secured land-rights documentation for several thousand Burmese farmers, and helped dozens of communities in Liberia, Uganda, and Mozambique to win their land rights.Namati convenes the Global Legal Empowerment Network, more than 1,000 groups from 150 countries who are learning from one another and collaborating on common challenges. This community successfully advocated for the inclusion of access to justice in the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. == Honors and awards == At Harvard, he won the Frederick Sheldon Fellowship, the Harvard Foundation Award for Advancing Intercultural and Race Relations, the Revival Undergraduate Prize, and the John Harvard Award for Academic Excellence.He received the Pioneer Award from the North American South Asian Bar Association in 2008.

              " 'HMCS Carleton is a Canadian Forces Naval Reserve Division (NRD) located in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Dubbed a stone frigate, HMCS Carleton is a land-based naval training establishment crewed by part-time sailors and also serves as a local recruitment centre for the Canadian Forces Naval Reserve. It is one of 24 naval reserve divisions located in major cities across Canada. == Namesake == HMCS Carleton is named after HMS Carleton, a British schooner which took part in the American War of Independence at the Battle of Valcour Island in 1776. == History == With the establishment of the Royal Canadian Navy Volunteer Reserve (RCNVR) in 1923, the Ottawa Half-Company was stood up in 1923. In 1935, the name of the Ottawa Half-Company was changed to the \"Ottawa Division of the RCNVR\". Just prior to Canada\\'s declaration of war on Germany, the Canadian government called the Naval Reserve into active service. For the duration of hostilities, the Ottawa Division concentrated on the recruitment and basic training of sailors and by the end of the war some 4,620 officers and men had enlisted through the Ottawa Reserve Division. On 1 November 1941, the Ottawa Division was commissioned as HMCS Carleton, named after HMS Carleton, a schooner named after Governor Guy Carleton, who defeated Richard Montgomery and Benedict Arnold at the Battle of Quebec on 31 December 1775.On 17 December 1943, HMCS Carleton moved to its current facilities at Canadian Forces Reserve Barrack Dow\\'s Lake, when the new \"stone frigate\" was inaugurated in the presence of Major General Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone and the then Governor General of Canada. In 1944, a new type of naval presence was added to Carleton when the barracks blocks were occupied by the Women\\'s Royal Canadian Naval Service (WRENS). New training facilities were then added to Carleton in the late 1940s and early 1950s. A memorial anchor with plaques on a concrete base, and nine-pounder guns were erected by HMCS Carleton. This memorial, which was unveiled on 6 May 1973 by Governor General Roland Michener, is dedicated to the Naval Reservists and the Naval Reserve in the fiftieth year of the Naval Reserve.Since its establishment, members of Carleton have played an active role in the National Capital Region. In recognition of its contribution to the community, Carleton was presented with the Key to the City of Ottawa in 1976 and Freedom of the City in 2017. == Operations == Until September 2013, HMCS Carleton operated continuously to provide employment and training for its sailors. Its facilities consisted of an administration building, drill hall, classroom building, shooting range, boat shed and a large vehicle compound. On 19 March 2008 several main supports for the roof of the drill hall failed resulting in its closure and then demolition, and this accelerated plans to replace the 65-year-old administration building and drill hall. Temporary office and classroom spaces, as well as a temporary parade structure, were installed on site. At the end of September 2013 demolition of the administration building began. A new administration building, including a drill hall, was built and opened its doors in 2015. An official \\'Manning Ship Ceremony\\' was held on 21 November 2015. Although most of the sailors who are members of HMCS Carleton work on a part-time basis through the training year (September to May), there is a staff of ten full-time members (five Class B Reservists and five Regular Force) who ensure the efficient operation and administration of the unit. HMCS Carleton has administration nights every Tuesday, and training nights on Thursdays from mid-September through to early May. HMCS Carleton also has weekend training throughout the year in order to augment training. == Battle honours == Lake Champlain, 1776 == Badge == Description: Barry wavy of eight Argent and Azure the crest from the Arms of Sir Guy Carleton, Baron Dorchester which is \"A dexter arm embowed and naked at the elbow the shirt sleeve folded above the elbow Argent and vested Gules; the hand grasping an arrow in bend sinister point downwards proper.\"Significance: Although the division was named after the British schooner HMS Carleton (Battle of Valcour Island, 11 October 1776), there is no doubt that the original ship was named in honour of Sir Guy Carleton who is accredited with having saved Canada for the British in the defeat of Montgomery and Arnold at Quebec, New Year\\'s Eve 1775–1776.

              " 'Qu Xixian (23 September 1919 – 19 March 2008) was a Chinese composer. She was born in Shanghai and graduated from Shanghai National Conservatory of Music in 1948 with degrees in composition and piano. She had a full, eventful career that spanned several eras of important Chinese history. She worked with the Central Philharmonic Society and held several leadership positions on the board of the Chinese Musicians\\' Association. Her choral works were performed in 1997, 1999 and 2000 in Beijing and Shanghai. == Early life and education == Xixian was born to parents Qu Baowen and Zhu Pingyu on September 23, 1919 in Shanghai. She loved music from a very young age, and began her formal music education during her childhood. In 1939, Xixian studied with German-Jewish composer, Wolfgang Fraenkel while he was living in Shanghai. Fraenkel had a profound influence on Xixian, as well as other prominent Chinese composers such as Ding Shande and Sang Tong. From 1940 to 1948, Xixian studied piano and composition at the Shanghai National Conservatory. Among her many teachers was Tan Xiaolin, a former pupil of Paul Hindemith, before his return to the United States in 1944. Shortly after graduating from the composition department of the Shanghai National Conservatory in 1948, Xixian began to teach harmony and music history at the Beijing Art Institute, now called Beijing Opera Arts College. == Composition career == In 1949 Xixian began to compose professionally. She wrote original scores for the Central Song and Dance Ensemble (which became the Central National Music Ensemble) from 1949 to 1954. Consequently, she composed for the Central Philharmonic Society (1954-unknown). A large portion of Xixian\\'s compositions are vocal pieces. She was particularly interested in choral writing and her unconventional use of diverse vocal timbres resulted in unique and innovative work. She became musically renowned for her beloved choral arrangements of Chinese folk songs. For example, her most famous piece “Pastoral” (Mu Ge) is a four-part vocal work based on the Dongmeng (Zhaowuda League, Inner Mongolia) folk song “Throwing Sticks.” In this piece, Xixian employs Western tonality and harmonically-driven melodies in conjunction with polyphonic interweaving. In 2010, the work was performed by Peiyang Chorus and can be viewed.Xixian had given personal concerts of choral works in 1987,1999, and 2000 in Beijing and Shanghai; had published Qu Xixian Chorus Selections in 2003, including 53 pieces, among which were arrangements of Pastoral, Usuli Bacarole, Clouds Flying Over the Unmoving Sky, and original compositions: Flying Petals, Call Me By My Pet Name, The Cuckoos are Singing, etc. Many of her works are still being performed in the 21st century. Xixian published C.D. and cassette entitled Flying Petals including 16 chorus works in 1995. Many of her works are still being performed in the 21st century. == Works == === Choral works === Pastoral (1954) Listening to Mother Talking of the Past (1957) - (lyrics by Guan Hua) First Prize in 1980 Children\\'s Song Contest. Chinese NCPA Chorus Cantata of the Red Army Base (1958) The Rickshaw Boy (1982) Call Me By My Pet Name (1985) We and You (1987) - First Prize Children\\'s Song Contest The Flying Petals (1988) - First Prize Teacher\\'s Song Contest. Performance by Peiyong Chorus. Releasing Pigeons at the Great Wall (1992) - First Prize Children\\'s Song Contest === Film scores === Song of Youth (1959) Music of the Red Flag (1960) Xiangzi the Camel (1981) == Leadership positions == Throughout her life, Xixian was involved as a composer and administrator for several elite music societies and organizations. In 1979 she was elected as the Director of the Chinese Musicians\\' Association. A few years later, in 1985, she became the Vice President. == Political involvement == A great deal of Xixian\\'s compositional work reflects various historical periods she lived through in China, such as New China, the Cultural Revolution and the Reform Era. Along with several other Chinese artists in the 1950s, Xixian used composition to participate in protesting their government\\'s plan to control social messages in music. Many songs that were written by this generation of Chinese musicians are still sung in the 21st Century. Xixian\\'s song in particular was quite positive and celebratory, entitled “Quan Shijie Renmin Xin Yi Tiao” which translates to “All The World’s People Are of the Same Mind.”Many of her compositions were inspired by folkloric stories or by what she observed of the world around her. Particularly, a few of her songs reflected the challenges and struggles faced by the Chinese lower class. For example, The Rickshaw Boy was inspired by the novel Rickshaw Boy written by Lao She, detailing the life of an impoverished boy who supports himself by towing a rickshaw. == Personal life == Beyond her musical career, Xixian\\'s interest in socio-political developed throughout her entire life. At the age of 18, Xixian left Shanghai and travelled to Hunan to participate in anti-Japanese rioting that occurred there in 1937. Toward the end of her life, Xixian greatly suffered from lung cancer. She believed that China should pass a “Right to Die” law, stating that “A good death is better than living with pain.\" On March 19, 2008, she died from lung cancer at the age of 89. While she was alive, her interests included reading and socializing with her friends. == Family == Ex-husband: Zhao Fusan == See also == Chan Hing-yan == References ==',\n",
              " 'The 2016 Indian heat wave was a major heat wave in April and May of that year. A national record high temperature of 51.0 °C (123.8 °F) was set in the town of Phalodi, in the state of Rajasthan. Over 160 people died with 330 million affected to some degree. There were also water shortages with drought worsening the impact of the heat wave. == Background == According to the India Meteorological Department, a heat wave is defined as a maximum air temperature of at least 40 °C (104 °F) in the plains and 30 °C (86 °F) in hilly regions, and is also declared when the maximum temperature remains 45 °C (113 °F) or higher, irrespective of the normal maximum temperature.In India, the month of May is typically one of the hottest and driest. In 2016, the heat came early, with 111 heat-related casualties reported by 8 April. Most of the heat waves in India since 1998 are associated with droughts; a major drought and worsening water shortages had affected around 330 million people by 23 May. The high temperatures, combined with other atmospheric disturbances, led to thunderstorms and lightning strikes in some states, leading to deaths, the destruction of houses and uprooted trees, as well as affecting crops and farm animals. The monsoon rains that would provide some relief were nearly one week behind the scheduled date, and would not reach the north until several weeks later.More than 20,000 people have died of heat wave-related causes in India since 1992; the heat wave in 2015 was one of the five deadliest on record. == Impact == The highest temperatures typically occur in May or June prior to the annual monsoon. Increasing temperatures and more frequent heat waves appear to be a result of human-induced climate change. In response to these more frequent events, many cities across India have implemented plans to warn people of the dangers of excessive heat.While the number of deaths was relatively small, those most likely to die from heat exposure were labourers who were forced to work outside despite a government ban limiting work during the hottest part of the day. Schools were also ordered to extend the summer holiday to reduce the risk to children. The greatest impact of the extreme temperatures were on crops, with hundreds of millions of people affected by the failure of food crops.The government hospital in Phalodi reported 500 patient visits, double the average number; many of those patients were complaining of diarrhea. To combat the heat, people drink water, but in 2016 the heat was coupled with drought. Lack of adequate water leads to dehydration and consumption of contaminated water leads to diarrhea. It is likely that the death totals were significantly underestimated due to a lack of systematic data collection. == Health effects == A heat wave usually causes severe health conditions and death. Heat stroke and heat stress are two of these adverse effects. Also, the heat wave was the main cause of the prevalence of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases in hospitals. The humidity and temperature increases caused harmful health effects, especially for vulnerable people such as the elderly, children, outdoor workers and people in poor living conditions. Indian people\\'s health were affected indirectly by water scarcity for both drinking and grazing purposes. That led to heat-related health challenges such as dehydration hyperthermia. Therefore, Indian people suffered from dizziness and organ dysfunction. In Phalodi, people suffered from diarrhea and high body temperature.The mortality rate differs in India during different months and in different cities. At the beginning of April 2016, more than 100 people died from heat. In the three Indian cities of Delhi, Telangana and Odisha more than 600 died in just one month. In the region of Bihar, 180 people died, and a large number were affected by heat stroke. The National Disaster Management Authority Government of India shows that 1,111 died because of the heat wave in 2016. == Local response == In Orissa, Maharashtra and Gujarat, programs were launched to educate people on hydration, providing shelters and training medical workers. In Andhra Pradesh, government workers distributed water and buttermilk, whilst TV and newspaper adverts urged people to stay indoors during peak hours.Schools were shut down in Odisha and Telangana weeks ahead of summer holidays. Hospitals stopped performing surgeries. A ban on day-time (9am - 6pm) cooking was imposed to prevent accidental fires. India\\'s Supreme Court ordered the Indian Premier League out of Maharashtra, stopping 13 cricket matches because of the amount of water needed to prepare pitches.There were numerous calls for more government action. Leading Indian economists, rights activists and academics sent an open letter to the government expressing the same. In his monthly radio address, Modi pledged 20 billion rupees ($400 million) to deal with the crisis.In Maharastra, the local government\\'s response to the portable water shortage was to supply water to its city via train. The train became known as \"Jaldoot\" (Hindi), meaning \"water saviour\". In a single nine-hour journey the train was able to deliver 2.5 million litres of water. == References ==',\n",
              " 'Carlo Salteri (23 October 1920 – 12 October 2010) was a prominent Australian businessman, mechanical engineer, founder of Tenix and co-founder of Transfield. == Background and early years == The eldest child of Giuseppe and Flavia Salteri, Carlo Salteri was born on 23 October 1920 and raised in a well-heeled family in Milan, Italy. In 1940 he commenced an engineering degree at Politecnico before being called up by the Italian army a year later, where he served as a junior artillery officer. At the conclusion of World War II Salteri commenced work with Italian engineering company, Società Anonima Elettrificazione SpA (SAE), before the company was awarded a contract to build powerlines in Australia. Salteri was appointed in charge of the 25 workers travelling to Australia, together with Franco Belgiorno as his deputy. In 1951 Salteri migrated to Australia with his wife Renata and young family. == Career == === Transfield === After working in Australia for five years with SAE, in 1956 both Salteri and Belgiorno-Nettis (as he later became known) jointly decided to leave SAE and form Transfield, in a partnership that lasted 40 years. The company focused on major engineering projects, such as bridges, tunnels, dams, hydro-electric and coal power stations, oil rigs, concert halls, sugar mills and power lines. Included in their list of major achievements are the construction of the Gateway Bridge in Brisbane and the Sydney Harbour Tunnel. By the early 1980s, Transfield had in excess of 3,000 employees and an annual turnover of A$350 million; and within five years grew to the point of being the biggest engineering firm in south-east Asia. The company acquired the Williamstown Dockyard in Melbourne and, in 1989 after winning a A$6 billion contract to build ten ANZAC class frigates for the Australian and New Zealand governments, the largest defence company in Australia. When visiting Australia in 1986 Pope John Paul II toured the Transfield factory located at Seven Hills.The pair stood down as joint managing directors in 1989 in favour of their eldest sons, Paul Salteri and Marco Belgiorno-Zegna. However, in a dispute between Salteri and Belgiorno-Nettis in 1995, the differences between the two families became irreconcilable and Transfield, then valued at A$733.2 million was split in two. The Belgiorno-Nettis family kept the name Transfield and the construction side of the business, while the Salteri family got the company\\'s North Sydney headquarters and the defence operations, which they then renamed as Tenix. === Tenix === Tenix grew quickly on the back of the contracts to construct the ANZAC class frigates and completion of the Jindalee Operational Radar Network (JORN) project. The company expanded across the defence sector into engineering infrastructure and service businesses, such as gas, water, electricity, and the supply of speed cameras and traffic wardens. By the time that Salteri retired in 2007, Tenix had annual revenue of A$1.7 billion. Tenix sold its defence business to BAE Systems in June 2008, and its main business interests are in infrastructure and parking and traffic businesses across Australia, New Zealand, the Pacific and the USA.The name Tenix derives from tenacity, inspired by a comment made by Salteri\\'s grandfather when Salteri was a young boy: \"...to make one million, one has to start from a 5 centime coin...\"Salteri reputably kept this coin from that day, until the day of his death. == Personal == In 1999, Salteri was made a Grand Officer of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic by the Italian government. In 2002, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia for service as a leader in industrial and technological development in Australia, to the engineering, construction and manufacturing industries, and to the community through a range of artistic, cultural and health-related organisations.Salteri established the Tenix Foundation to provide assistance for education, research and underprivileged children. Up until his death, Salteri was a patron of the Australian Indigenous Education Foundation and was a key supporter of education for Indigenous students.Salteri died at the Mater Hospital in Sydney after a short illness on 10 October 2010, aged 89. == See also == Tenix Tenix Defence Transfield Services == References ==',\n",

              " 'The Samad (Arabic: صماد) (also spelled Sammad) is a family of long-range UAVs of unidentified origin used in the Middle East. The Samad is available in three variants: The Samad-1, the Samad-2 (also known as \"UAV-X\"), and the Samad-3. The Samad family of UAVs is primarily used by the Houthi movement in the Yemeni civil war, where the drone\\'s long range is used to strike targets in Saudi Arabia and the UAE. == Etymology == The UAV was named after Houthi leader Saleh al-Sammad, who was assassinated by the UAE in 2018. == Design == The Samad is available in three models. All models have distinctive V-shaped tail fins and a pusher engine. Samad UAVs have a ventral protrusion and wing skids, which they use for takeoff and landing.The Houthis say they have designed and manufactured the Samad family of drones. They say that the Samad 1 was designed in 2018 and the Samad Samad 2 and Samad 3 in 2019. Independent analysts say the Samad-2 is probably of Iranian origin.[needs better source] According to James Rogers, of the Center for War Studies at the University of Southern Denmark, the Samad 3 is believed to be supplied by Iran.The Samad-1 is the base variant. It has a wingspan of approximately 3.5 meters. It has a range of 500 km and is for surveillance.The Samad-2 is 2.8 meters long and has a wingspan of 4.5 meters. It has distinctive V-shaped tail fins and is powered by a rear-mounted German or Chinese pusher-engine. It is also known as the \"UAV-X\", the provisional designation given to it in a UN report. The Samad-2 can carry either a reconnaissance or an explosive payload. The reconnaissance version carries a camera, a Nikon D810 digital camera in one model. The attack variant has a warhead of 18 kg of explosives mixed with ball bearings.The Samad-3 is an \"extended-range\" version with a conformal fuel tank mounted on the top of the drone. The dimensions are estimated at 4.5m wingspan, like the Samad-2. According to the Houthis, it has a range of 1,500 km and carries an explosive payload. Qualitatively, the Samad-3 is described as \"inexpensive, small, slow and clumsy\" and unlikely to strike targets with good accuracy. == Operational history == The Houthis have operated Samad UAVs since at least August 2018.The Houthis say a Samad-3 UAV was used to attack Abu Dhabi international airport on 26 July 2018. Analysis by Jeremy Binnie of Jane\\'s of footage released by the Houthis of the attack says it is consistent with a Samad-2 or Samad-3, or also a different drone, the Hudhud 1. The UAE denied there was any drone attack on the airport. Two other alleged claims on a drone attack on the airport were reported by the Houthis, as well as two attacks on Dubai International Airport, all which were denied and unverified. An investigation by Bellingcat, published months before video of the attack was released, said \"It is highly likely that a Houthi-led drone attack did not take place in Abu Dhabi and Dubai\".The Houthi military spokesman said used Samad 3 drones, at the Abqaiq–Khurais attack on 14 September 2019. == Operators == Hezbollah– Samad-1 (according to two bloggers, Stijn Mitzer and Joost Oliemans) Houthis – Samad-1, Samad-2, and Samad-3 Iran – IRGC, Samad-1 (according to the above bloggers.) == Specifications (Samad-2 / UAV-X) == Data from UN Panel of Experts on YemenGeneral characteristics Crew: none (unmanned) Length: 2.80 m (9 ft 2 in) Wingspan: 4.50 m (14 ft 9 in) Powerplant: 1 × Chinese-made DLE 170 or German-made 3W110i B2 enginePerformance Maximum speed: 200–250 km/h (120–160 mph, 110–130 kn) Ferry range: 1,200–1,500 km (750–930 mi, 650–810 nmi) (est. by engine manufacturer)Avionics unknown == References == == External links ==',\n",

              " 'Caesar Tarrant (1740–1797) was an American boat pilot who served as a patriot in the American Revolutionary War. Born a slave, Tarrant\\'s skill as a pilot aboard the Patriot led to his manumission by the state after the war. == Early life == Tarrant was from Hampton, Virginia, home to many river boat pilots. Though a slave, by the time he was a young adult he had learned how to pilot vessels through the nearby riverways. He was sold once after gaining this skill and it increased his sale price. He married Lucy, a woman enslaved by a different owner, and they had three children. == Revolutionary War == Lord Dunmore, governor of the Colony of Virginia, responded in 1775 to early revolutionary actions by recruiting Virginians to strike back. He issued Dunmore\\'s Proclamation, offering freedom to any enslaved people who fought for the crown. Hundreds signed up to fight with him, but Tarrant decided instead to fight for the Patriots.The Virginia Navy hired Tarrant as a pilot, placing him on several vessels during the war. While serving on the Patriot in 1778, Tarrant participated in a battle at the Virginia Capes, a high priority area for the navy. Tarrant out-maneuvered and rammed the Lord Howe, a British privateer vessel. Both sides took injuries and the British ship escaped, but Tarrant garnered praise from his captain, who said he \"behaved gallantly\". == After the war == Having served in the state navy for three years, Tarrant returned home to Hampton. The state and fledgling United States governments had not promised freedom to slaves fighting on the Patriots\\' side. Tarrant remained enslaved and was passed on to his owner\\'s daughter after his death in 1784. In 1789, the Virginia General Assembly directed the executive branch to purchase Tarrant and manumit him. The purchase was concluded that year, and the newly-free Tarrant began freeing the rest of his family. == Legacy == In his will, written in 1796, Tarrant willed his property in Hampton to his wife, with half to go to their daughter Nancy upon Lucy\\'s death. His son Sampson also inherited some property. Lucy sold part of the estate to free their daughter Lidy from slavery.Two schools in Hampton were named after Tarrant. Cesar Tarrant Elementary closed in 2015. Cesar Tarrant Middle School was renamed from Jefferson Davis Middle School in 2018, with support for the renaming shifting in part due to backlash against the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. == Notes == == References == === Bibliography === Jackson, L.

He is a graduate of the Institute of Political Studies in Strasbourg. He is married and the father of two little girls. He joined the Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs in 2004. The various positions he held in Paris and in the diplomatic field abroad led him to develop a particular interest in the United Nations and the European Union. In Paris, he specifically dealt with disarmament and non-proliferation issues, and then negotiations at the UN Security Council regarding the Middle East. In New York, in 2009, he was an adviser-negotiator at the French Mission to the United Nations on African issues, before becoming the mission\\'s spokesperson until 2014. He then moved to Brussels to become the spokesperson for the Permanent Representation of France to the European Union, dealing in particular with the eurozone, migration and security issues at the European level. In May 2017, he joined Place Beauvau as a diplomatic advisor to the Minister of the Interior. === Honorary consuls === As a whole of the consular jurisdiction (nearly 4 million km2), the honorary consuls relieves the actions of the Consulate within the states of the Northwest. Usually, they legalize certain administrative procedures and directly collaborating with the Consulate General.

The explorer collected precious geographic and scientific goods from the region, boasting its \"enormous resources\" and strategic position. The French naturalist and botanist, Eugène Duflos de Mofras, was sent to the Pacific coast during the 1840s and published his book in which he depicts a vast region with a population of merely 4,000 people.The American West coast particularly interested the king, Louis-Philippe I, who had hoped to rebuild the great French empire before 1763. The summon of Louis Gasquet as Consul General of Monterey in November 1843, illustrates a type of political offensive by the government of the time. This unexpected presence worried American and Mexican authorities who struggled for the monopoly of the region. France was the first country to have official representation in California and Gasquet, aware of the predominant position of France, pushed the government to send naval forces as soon as possible. Refusing to recognize the sovereignty of Sloate and Stockton, established during the American independence from England, Gasquet was imprisoned for 51 days (in reality, a sentinel was placed in front of his home, preventing him from completing his consular mission). After an exchange of diplomatic letters, Louis Gasquet was finally released and replaced by Jacob Moerenhout in October 1846. Preserving the interests of his citizens and observing the turbulent behavior of his neighbors, Moernhout created a region favorable to French immigrants. He settled in the Consulate of Monterey, situated by the sea: \" a spacious house with a beautiful rose garden and orchards\". === The French community of San Francisco === When San Francisco was still called Yerba Buena (\"the good herb\"), only three French nationals were recorded among 800 inhabitants. However, the rapidly growing population (23,000 inhabitants in 1852) enticed the government of President Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte to establish the French Consulate in San Francisco, the new economic capital of the region. France already had a consular agent that exercised his duties until the arrival of the first Consul General, Mr. Patrice Dillion, on July 22, 1850. Unable to settle in a city still under construction, the Consul accepted the hospitality of a damp French ship on the bay. Sometime later, he decided to take residence on the corner of Jackson and Mason. The position of Consul General of France in San Francisco was significant because it introduced the most important diplomatic representation in all of the Western United States. According to Jehanne Biétry-Sallinger, California consisted of 352,000 inhabitants, of which 28,000 were French, almost 8% of the total population. The principal mission of the consulate at the time was to provide emergency assistance to new immigrants. When they arrived in this faraway and unknown region, their first stop was the consulate, to receive information and money to settle and work in the mines. San Francisco was an unsafe city and brawls often broke out between French and foreign miners. The Consul had to quickly flee to the hinterlands to escape being hung by his fellow citizens, as in Placerville in 1853. Moreover, the Consul organized numerous public ceremonies in honor of events that affected France, such as the storming of Sebastopol in 1855. This troubled period saw the development of a united and dynamic French community that grew each day as a result of boats shipping migrants bound for the \"streets to gold\". Most stayed and settled permanently: the erection of Notre-Dame-des-Victoires Catholic parish in 1856 is the most striking example. The church continues to celebrate Mass in French today. Gradually, the community organized and founded restaurants, laundries, and theaters near Bush and Mason Street; the French quarter thus developed rapidly. === The Consulate General of France in San Francisco === After 1892, the consular office moved to 604 Commercial Street, next to the port within the Financial District. Documents of the time disclosed an exact description of the Consulate of France : \" the neighborhood is modest, its entry is abrupt, but it seems as though there are enough serious motifs which have unfortunately been often criticized by the French colony and French voyagers in passing, the Consulate will be preserved here where it is. Insufficient funds for rent were administered to the chief of staff who then had to pay the remaining sum from his own reserves(…) in addition, our Consul would have received the authorization to renew the antique furniture that remained. It is necessary to include that the great majority of foreign consulates should not have a better status. The budget does not always measure up to amount expected. \" The earthquake of 1906 in San Francisco ruined most French investments and the consulate was completely destroyed. On April 20, 1906, a telegram addressed to the Quai d\\'Orsay reads, \"The manager of our Consulate in San Francisco telegrams me with hopes to inform the Department that the Consulate is destroyed; the personnel is safe, the archives have stayed under the rubble. \" Little France therefore lost all its influence in local life. After the earthquake, the consulate settled at the Union Trust Building. Following the Second World War, that witnessed the succession of two Consuls to the same post (one representing Vichy France, the other liberated France), the Consulate installed at 690 Market Street. After the war, the residence of the two Consulates would be closed and official receptions would be held just in front, in the Palace Hotel. By 1958, the Consulate moved to a more spacious location in a three-story building on the corner of Bush and Taylor. During the 1970s, the consulate acquired of a very beautiful residence on Jackson Street (bought in 1967), in Pacific Heights. Sadly, the narrowness of the building and its miserable location, forced the Minister of Foreign Affairs to find a new local. It was after the construction of a modern building on 540 Bush Street (next to the church Notre-Dame-des-Victoires) that the Consulate installed in 1981. In 2011 the consulate moved to the 6th floor of the modern office tower on 88 Kearny Street. == Annexe == == See also == List of diplomatic missions of France Embassy of France, Washington, D.C.

Their first leader, Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Yusuf, a son of Ali ibn Yusuf al-Massufi and the Almoravid Princess Ghaniya, was appointed as governor of the Balearic Islands in 1126. Following the collapse of the Almoravid power at the hand of the Almohads in the 1140s, the Banu Ghaniya continued to govern the Balearic Islands as independent emirs until about 1203, with a brief interruption in the 1180s. Later leaders (Ali ibn Ishaq and Yahya) made a determined attempt to reconquer the Maghreb (and in particular Ifriqiya), taking Bougie, Constantine and Algiers, and conquering most of modern Tunisia from about 1180 onwards.

              " 'The 36th Iowa Infantry Regiment was an infantry regiment that served in the Union Army during the American Civil War. == Service == === Early days of the regiment === The Thirty-sixth Iowa Infantry Regiment, US Volunteers, was one of several Midwestern volunteer regiments raised in Iowa, Illinois and Wisconsin in the late winter, spring and summer of 1862. Companies A and K consisted of men from Monroe County, while Companies B, C, D, E, F G, H and I were made up of men from Appanoose and Wapello Counties. A handful of additional men were mustered for the regiment from Wayne, Marion, Lucas, Davis, Lee and Van Buren Counties. The first recruits were mustered into state service as early as February 1862. The ranks were filled out with additional recruits following Lincoln\\'s July 1862 call for 300,000 state volunteers and, by early September, the regiment was officially designated the Thirty-sixth Iowa Infantry Regiment. Colonel Charles W. Kittredge of Ottumwa Iowa was placed in command. Colonel Kittredge had previously served as a captain with the 7th Iowa Infantry Regiment in Missouri during the first year of the war and was an experienced combat veteran. All companies rendezvoused at Camp Lincoln, Keokuk, Iowa where, on 4 October 1862, they were sworn into United States service for a term of three years. The men were first issued old Austrian and Belgian smoothbore muskets with \"sword\" bayonets, but these antiques were eventually replaced with more effective .58 caliber Springfield rifled muskets. Following four weeks of basic training at Camp Lincoln, the regiment departed Keokuk on 1 November 1862 aboard two steamboats for St. Louis to await corps and division assignment and to continue training. === St. Louis, Memphis and Helena === At St. Louis, the regiment went into garrison at Benton Barracks. The Thirty-sixth was attached to the XIII Corps, Army of the Tennessee, and commenced drill by brigade and division. On 20 December 1862 they embarked by steamer for the federal garrison at Helena, Arkansas. The vessel halted at Memphis, Tennessee when the local citizens hailed it from shore with an alarming report that Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest and his cavalry were in the neighborhood and were preparing an attack on the city. That night the men of the 36th slept with their arms stacked nearby in Jackson Square. The regiment eventually moved to some old vacated mule-sheds and remained in Memphis performing guard duty at Fort Pickering until 1 January 1863, when it resumed its movement to Helena. At Helena, the regiment became part of the 1st Brigade, 13th Division, XIII Corps under General Benjamin Prentiss. The regiment was initially quartered in tents but later moved into winter quarters at Fort Curtis in semi-permanent \"half-cabins\" consisting of log walls with canvas ceilings and dirt floors. These billets had formerly been occupied by the 47th Indiana Infantry Regiment. According to Captain Seth Swiggett of Company B, the ex-Postmaster at Blakesburg, Iowa, the Iowans devised an efficient central heating system in these cabins by burying a length of stovepipe beneath the dirt floor and running it the length of the cabin from a small tin stove on one end to an exhaust pipe on the opposite end. With 5 to 8 men occupying each cabin, the regiment passed the month of January 1863 in as comfortable a manner as could be expected under the circumstances. === The Yazoo Pass Expedition and the First Military Action at Shellmound, Mississippi === In February 1863, the Thirty-sixth Iowa, 600 strong and part of 13th Division of the XIII Corps commanded by General Leonard Ross, embarked on troop transports for Mississippi to take part in the Yazoo Pass, or Fort Pemberton Expedition. This operation was conceived by General Grant and entailed blowing an opening through the east bank of the Mississippi River near Moon Lake below Helena to open a channel connecting with an inland water route that would enable Grant to encircle the Confederate stronghold at Vicksburg, Mississippi from the north. Veterans of the regiment recalled that during reconnaissance patrols the men had to wade through swamps waist deep. The regiment saw its first action at Shellmound, Mississippi where, after witnessing a fierce artillery duel between federal gunboats and rebel batteries, Captain Swiggett noted that the 36th Iowa had a \"sharp exchange\" with the rebels The regiment was holding a picket line some 2 miles above the enemy fort and was under frequent artillery fire for several days. No men were killed by enemy action due to the cover afforded by woods on the west bank of the Tallahatchie River. The regiment was engaged on this march for 43 days. They found no unguarded route to Vicksburg and the expedition was abandoned. The men suffered greatly because of almost continuous exposure to the elements on this campaign, including freezing rain and high winds that blew their tents down. In addition to colds, flu fevers and rheumatism, many men were struck down by typhoid and malaria. === The Battle of Helena === Returning to Helena, the Thirty-sixth commenced a physically demanding daily regimen of drill and building fortifications in anticipation of a Confederate attack expected with the arrival of spring weather. The Thirty-sixth was assigned to build breast works and trenches in support of Battery A at Fort Curtis, on the northernmost end of the Union defenses. The federal line ran in a semicircle around the town with the Mississippi River being their east flank. On 4 July 1863, a Confederate force under General Holmes estimated at between 8,000 and 10,000 attacked Helena. With devastating artillery fire and additional fire support from the U.S. Navy gunboat Tyler anchored in the river offshore, the Union positions repulsed the assault in a savage, bloody slugfest lasting from dawn until 2 p.m. under a burning hot sun. The Confederates nearly captured some of the federal redoubts where the fighting devolved into hand-to-hand combat. Confederate losses were estimated at 2,000–3,000 and more than 700 of these were taken prisoner. The federals remained on the field in their assigned positions for two more days until it was clear that Holmes\\' rebels were in full retreat to Little Rock. Much of that time was allowed to burying hundreds of Confederate dead in mass graves where they had fallen. Vicksburg also surrendered to Grant on 4 July while elsewhere General George Meade repulsed Lee at Gettysburg. The two victories at Helena and Vicksburg on 4 July, and the surrender of the rebel strong-post of Port Hudson on 9 July, ended further serious Confederate threats to federal operations along the Mississippi River and severed communication between rebel forces on opposite sides of the Mississippi for the remainder of the war. With New Orleans, Port Hudson, Vicksburg, Helena, Memphis and Columbus Kentucky in federal hands, the Confederacy west of the river was isolated from secessionist allies in the east. However, rebel guerrilla bands continued to harass federal river traffic from both banks of the Mississippi until the end of the war. === DeValls Bluff, Pine Bluff and the capture of Little Rock === Following the battle at Helena, the Thirty-sixth was attached to the Third Division, 1st Brigade, Expeditionary Army of Arkansas commanded by Major General Frederick Steele. Marching from Helena on 12 August, the Third Division reached Clarendon, on the White River. Steele complained to his superior, General Stephen Hurlbut at Memphis that he was burdened on his march by at least 10000 men on the sick list. It got even worse at Clarendon, a malaria-breeding village. A number of men of the 36th were left there awaiting river transportation north to DeValls Bluff, where Steele was establishing his main supply base. Those fit to march left Clarendon and proceeded north to DeValls Bluffs. At this point, Brigadier General John Davidson arrived with the 1st (Cavalry) Division and rendezvoused with Steele. Davidson\\'s division did most of the heavy fighting with the troops of Confederate generals Marsh Walker, John Marmaduke and Sterling Price over the next twenty days. As Davidson moved forward and captured Brownsville, the Third and Second Divisions followed . When Davidson\\'s force was blocked at Reed\\'s Bridge, on Bayou Metoe, the 36th and other regiments of the Third Division made a demonstration on the confederate left flank as a diversion. Steele and Davidson then decided on a surprise flank attack from the south bank of the Arkansas River, which was executed on the morning of 10 September. Although not unanticipated, Marmaduke and Price were surprised by the speed with which Davidson made the crossing at Ashley Ford. Driving westward straight toward Little Rock, the infantry of the Third Division followed a parallel course supporting artillery batteries firing on the rebels from the north shore. By 7:30 pm Price and Marmaduke had abandoned the capital and civil authorities surrendered Little Rock to Davidson. Steele arrived a day later. The 36th Iowa did not cross the Arkansas and enter the city until 15 September due to the fact that in their retreat, the Confederates had burned the boat-bridge spanning the two shores, and then a Union pontoon bridge broke down. Upon entering Little Rock, the Third Division and 36th encamped on the spacious high ground south of town near the re-captured U.S. Arsenal and there constructed a permanent camp for winter quarters and endured a bitterly cold winter. Meanwhile, Price and Marmaduke escaped toward Camden, Washington and Murfreesboro to winter while Arkansas state officials moved their capital to the county courthouse at Washington, Arkansas near the Texas-Louisiana border. === The Dodd Affair === On 8 January 1964, an 80-man detachment from the 36th Iowa and similar detachments from all of the Union regiments encamped near the arsenal formed on the parade ground to witness the execution of 17-year-old David Dodd, a Confederate spy. Dodd had attended nearby St. John College—a private secondary academy—but dropped out after a few months and relocated with his parents to Texas when the Union Army occupied Little Rock. He became a telegraph clerk and learned Morse Code and next joined his father who was a civilian sutler for a Confederate regiment stationed in Mississippi. Returning to Camden Arkansas, Dodd intended to return to Little Rock, ostensibly to visit former classmates and an older sister still enrolled there. He obtained a pass to depart Confederate lines from General James Fagan, who allegedly told young Dodd, \"I expect a full report upon your return.\" Approaching Union lines he obtained a legitimate US Army pass and continued into the city where he spent three days. As Dodd departed Little Rock on the afternoon of the third day, he headed down the Benton road southwest of the city and passed through a federal picket line, where he surrendered his pass, believing he had exited federal lines. Two miles further, however, Dodd encountered a second Union picket line and, having no pass, was arrested by federal troopers of the 8th Missouri Cavalry. Taken before an officer, Dodd was interrogated and could not provide a satisfactory explanation for wandering through the neighborhood at that hour. A notebook taken from him contained notes in Morse Code that, when translated by the assistant army telegrapher, described accurately much of the federal Order of Battle in Little Rock and the disposition of infantry regiments and artillery batteries. With this incriminating evidence in hand, Dodd was taken before a senior officer of the 8th Missouri and further interrogated. It was at this point the prisoner was body-searched, and additional papers and a loaded Derringer pistol were found in his coat. A full investigation revealed that Dodd was almost certainly assisted by a local female accomplice, who was also brought before military authorities and interrogated. Dodd was sentenced to death by a specially appointed Military Commission on a 4 to 2 vote on 5 January 1864. An execution date was set for 8 January. Steele did not bring charges against the female—a close friend of Dodd\\'s and a vocal secessionist whose father quartered Union officers in his home. Instead of charging the daughter and son, Steele had them removed from the Department of Arkansas and deported to Vermont, their native state. There they were essentially placed on house arrest for the duration of the war. Dodd\\'s case drew the attention of thousands of Arkansans who sought clemency. Steele offered clemency to Dodd if the youngster would reveal who his accomplices were, which offer Dodd refused. The morning of Dodd\\'s execution he was placed on the end-gate of an army ambulance wagon that had been driven beneath a scaffold. Bound hand and foot, Dodd was made to step out onto the wagon tailgate which was propped up by a stout wooden post. The noose was placed around his neck and the post was knocked out from beneath the tail-gate causing the teenager to fall straight down. Unfortunately, the rope stretched, and the fall did not break Dodd\\'s neck; he struggled for several minutes as he slowly strangled to death. After nearly 10 minutes a Union surgeon pronounced him dead. Some federal soldiers who witnessed the execution described it as a \"sickening\" and \"ghastly\" affair. but evidence from diaries and letters indicates most felt no remorse or were disturbed by Dodd\\'s execution. === The Camden Expedition of the Red River Campaign === On 6 January 1864, the Army activated the VII Army Corps to reorganize the former \"Expeditionary Army of Arkansas\" that had captured Little Rock. Additional regiments were brought to Little Rock from other theaters through the months of January, February and March. The formal announcement of the establishment of the VII Army Corps was made to the troops in February. Steele was resistant to the notion of invading southern Arkansas, primarily due to the already existing shortage of rations at Little Rock, and the fact that any expedition south of the Arkansas river would further distance the army from its already precarious supply lines. Finally Steele received a direct order from Grant (his West Point classmate) to move south and proceed toward Shreveport, Louisiana to link up with Union forces under command of General Nathaniel Banks, who by then had already commenced a campaign up the Red River, converging upon Shreveport. The plan called for Steele\\'s Corps to link up with Banks there and together the combined Union force would push into East Texas to \"Plant the US flag.\" It was hoped that Steele\\'s southward thrust from Little Rock would catch Confederate Commander E. Kirby Smith—Commanding the Confederate Army of the Trans-Mississippi—in a pincer movement, force Smith to fight a two-front action and thus divert precious Confederate resources from the main line of battle on the Red River. It proved to be one of the most ill-advised Union operations of the entire war. Against his better judgment, the skeptical Steele departed Little Rock on 23 March with some 12,000 troops, including the 36th Iowa Infantry Regiment, restricted to half-ratrions. He knew that the country through which he would march was barren and that foraging alone would not supply sufficient grass for horses and mules or food for the troops, and that federal supply trains from Little Rock and Pine Bluff would be essential to his effort. The column immediately encountered rebel skirmishers along the line of march that followed the Old Military Road from Little Rock southwestward to Washington Arkansas near the Texas border. Steele would skirmish and fight major actions against the Rebel Army of Arkansas under Major-General Sterling Price on each of the next 30 days. The first major engagement took place as Steele\\'s column reached Elkin\\'s Ford on the Little Missouri River on 3 April. Some 2,500 rebels lay in ambush at the ford and viciously attacked as the federals made their crossing. A sharp infantry and artillery exchange ensued in which the 1st Battalion of the Thirty-sixth Iowa played a key role. Under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Francis Drake, the small Federal detachment of about 500 men from Companies A, D & G, 36th Iowa, three companies of the 43rd Indiana, two picket companies of dismounted troopers of the 1st Iowa Cavalry, and a two-gun artillery section from Battery E, 2nd Missouri Light Artilley skirmished all day as the Confederates bought time to bring up 2,500 reinforcements under command of Major-General John S. Marmaduke after nightfall. Fighting renewed at 6 a.m. the following mornings and lasted 7 hours as Drake and his small command gave ground stubbornly as the larger rebel force tried to drive them back into the Little Missouri River. Meanwhile, Colonel Charles Kittredge moved up the remaining 7 companied of the 36th Iowa to Drake\\'s support. Ordering them to lie down behind a slight ridge on the edge of a cleared field, they lay in wait for the right moment. Marmaduke\\'s artillery concentrated own both Union flanks and on the Federal gun section at last compelled the three companies of the 43rd Indiana holding the Union left flank to give way. Retreating toward the field in disarray, Colonel Kittredge ordered his 7 companies to stand up and fire. They delivered such a devastating volley of musket fire at point blank range that Marmadukes\\' rebels were completely routed and forced to retire south toward Prairie D\\'Ane with significant casualties. Steele\\'s column was at this time reinforced by Brigadier General John Thayer\\'s Frontier Division which had marched from Fort Smith. The combined column continued onward, harassed at every opportunity by rebel skirmishers and snipers as it proceeded slowly on dusty roads through thick forests to the southwest. These attacks slowed Steele\\'s progress and the Corps managed to move only 82 miles in 10 days. Facing the unexpected resistance, and growing dangerously short on supplies, Steele placed all troops on quarter-rations. The Confederates finally attacked in force as the federals emerged into open country on the Prairie D\\'Ane near present-day Prescott, Arkansas. The rebels had built fortifications in depth on the prairie. Much of the fighting at Prairie D\\'Ane was an artillery duel, while the 36th Iowa was brought forward to help make a flanking demonstration on the rebel right flank that convinced Marmaduke to retire from the prairie. Sweeping the rebels aside, Steele now learned from prisoners and spies that Bank\\'s Red River expedition had been soundly beaten at Grande Ecore, and that Banks was in full retreat. With his men on 1/4 rations and now deep in enemy country, Steele changed course and made for Camden, hoping that the Navy could re-supply him there using the navigable Ouchita River. The defeat of Banks on the Red River enabled Kirby Smith to immediately move General Dick Taylor\\'s Texas division north into southern Arkansas—bringing additional infantry regiments with him from Louisiana and raising some newly recruited units along the way. Taylor opposed this movement, preferring to continue to chase Banks\\'s army on its retreat to Alexandria and hopefully destroy him there. Realizing his imperiled situation, Steele prepared to abandon Camden and march back to Little Rock. === Massacre at Poison Spring === Steele moved into Camden on 15 April with almost no resistance and discovered that the rebels had destroyed all the steam gristmills near the city except Britton\\'s Mill some 6 miles south of town. The 36th Iowa was ordered to seize the mill and they spent the next few days getting it back in operation and grinding what supply of corn could found by Union foraging parties into meal for the army. Steele meanwhile sent scouts foraging for other sources of grain and food, and word soon reached his headquarters that a large cache of corn had been discovered some 18 miles northwest of Camden on the upper Washington Road near Poison Springs. On 17 April, Steele ordered Colonel James Williams of Thayer\\'s Frontier Division to assemble a foraging patrol consisting of the 1st Kansas Colored Infantry, elements of three Kansas cavalry regiments, a battery of light artillery and 198 wagons to collect the grain. The next day as the loaded federal wagons were getting underway for the return to Camden, the escort was met by the 18th Iowa Infantry which had marched out to reinforce the party at first light. Near the road junction a few miles from Poison Spring, the advance of Williams\\' column was ambushed. Outnumbered nearly 8 to 1 by the forces of Generals John Marmaduke and Samuel Maxey, the federals were hit first by Maxey\\'s troops lying in ambush in heavy thicket on their right flank. As they changed front to meet that attack, the larger force to their front assaulted and nearly encircled the federals. Cut off from their route of escape, they were driven steadily to the rear and took refuge behind sheds of a nearby plantation where efforts were made to rally the men to make a stand. The relentless rebel attack pushed them to the rear of the train which they were forced to abandon and some 900 yards further, all the way to a timber line and into a swamp. Those in the rear of the retreating federal column were scattered and in disarray and soon encircled and were shot down or were compelled to surrender. The federals suffered more than 300 casualties, including 204 wounded. True to the threats of Jefferson Davis and the Confederate Government, Negro troops received no quarter in this battle. Most of the enlisted men of the 1st Kansas Colored Infantry were killed, wounded or were summarily executed after they surrendered. Such was the savagery found in the western theater of operations during the Civil War. The disaster at Poison Spring resulted in the loss of 198 supply wagons, a four-gun battery—which however were spiked by the federal gunners—and the horses and mules to pull them, exacerbating further Steele\\'s supply problem. The men of the Thirty-sixth Iowa clearly heard the sounds of the Poison Springs battle to their northwest and then discovered that Fagan had moved his mounted brigade up to within two miles of Brittons\\' Mills. Realizing that the rebels could attack them at first light with overwhelming numbers, and having no artillery and just a small cavalry detachment with them, the regiment loaded their wagons and made a forced march back into Camden after dark. . === Disaster at Mark\\'s Mills === A 240-wagon supply train arrived at Camden from the federal base at Pine Bluff on 20 April, but it only carried half-rations for ten days. With supplies short, Steele ordered Lt. Colonel Francis Drake, Thirty-sixth Iowa, to take temporary command of the 2nd Brigade to escort these wagons back to Pine Bluff. At Pine Bluff, Drake was to refill the wagons and escort the train back to Camden. Colonel William McLean, the brigade commander was reported to be \"indisposed,\" while Colonel Charles Kittredge, next in line for command of the 2nd Brigade, was reported sick in quarters; Kittredge thus sent his number two, LTC Drake in his place to command the train and the 2nd Brigade. Major Augustus H. Hamilton assumed direct command of the 36th Iowa on this operation. The remainder of the brigade included elements of the 1st Indiana Cavalry and 5th Missouri Cavalry, the 43rd Indiana Infantry, 77th Ohio Infantry, and four artillery pieces in two section of Battery E, 2nd Missouri Light Artillery—about 1,200 troops in all. Additionally, the 1st Iowa Cavalry Regiment, which had served its 3 years and was on its way home on furlough and for re-enlistment, was scheduled to follow and catch up with Drake\\'s train on the 1st or 2nd day. The brigade also included a section of 75 civilian Negro pioneer laborers whose job it was to move ahead of the train, felling trees and laying them down to build corduroy roads over the muddy, difficult route. The train with escort left Camden on Friday, 22 April and Drake soon found that an additional entourage of some 50–75 civilian wagons carrying teamsters, sutlers, cotton speculators, about 300 Negro refugees and other assorted camp followers had joined the expedition. Due to very muddy road conditions, progress was slow and the column was harassed by cavalry scouts belonging to Rebel General Jo Shelby\\'s \"Iron Brigade\" on the first day out from Camden. Shelby had no interest in bringing on a general engagement but was ranging widely east of the Ouachita River to keep an eye on Union forces operating there. The scouts who skirmished with Drake on the first day immediately informed Shelby of the large supply train, and when Shelby linked up with a large Confederate Task Force commanded by Major-General James Fagan the following day, Fagan decided to make a forced march with 7 brigades 50 miles east to establish and ambush position. By mid-afternoon of the second days of march—a Sunday—Drake had reached the western approach to the Moro River—essentially a large creek that habitually went out of its banks in a wide swath due to spring rains. Lieutenant Samuel Swiggett, B/36th, recounted in his memoirs that, while no surface water could be discerned in the Moro Bottom, the ground was so saturated by the recent rains that anyone or anything attempting to cross it would become hopelessly buried deep in mud and muck. Steele had cautioned Drake not to attempt to cross the Moro Bottom after dark, and additionally, the civilian teamsters were starting to get out of hand, complaining to Drake about the rigors of the pace, according to Swiggett. Rather than proceed, therefore, Drake halted the column on the west bank of the Moro Bottom on Sunday afternoon. In his official after-action report, Drake stated that he stopped the column that Sunday \"evening\". The timing is very much in dispute, for Captain Swiggett later noted in his memoirs that the column halted long before nightfall and in fact had gone into camp on the west bank at 2 pm Sunday. Captain Swiggett opined that, had Drake exhibited more backbone by insisting on moving across Moro Bottom Sunday afternoon, the entire train could have crossed safely before nightfall, would have been well on its way to Pine Bluff, and would have avoided the tragedy to come. Although Drake could perhaps claim later that he was technically following Steele\\'s orders by going into bivouac when he did, Swiggett noted that there was a strong sense of gloom and foreboding in the federal camp as they lay there immobile on Sunday afternoon. As it was, Drake posted cavalry squads of 25 troopers each 2 miles to his front and 5 miles to his rear on Sunday, with orders for them to scout all roads for 5 miles in all directions at daybreak on Monday. Sunday night passed without incident and, having received no reports of the enemy from his scouts on Monday morning, Drake ordered the march resumed. The 43rd Indiana Infantry Regiment was deployed to lead the way, while the 36th Iowa marched on the flank of the wagons. Drake ordered the 77th Ohio to form the rear-guard and that regiment lagged almost 3 miles to the rear. As the column crossed the Moro Bottom with difficulty and headed to higher ground, federal scouts informed Major Wesley Norris commanding the 43rd Indiana that they had discovered signs of large, hastily abandoned cavalry encampments to their immediate front. Norris sent a report back to Drake, who dismissed it rather curtly and sent forward orders for the 43rd to pick up the pace. A short distance further, in a clearing at a fork in the road occupied by a few log cabins, the 43rd Indiana was fired on by dismounted rebel cavalry from General Fagan\\'s command. Fagan had evaded Union scouts the previous night by crossing the Ouachita River below Camden and making a forced march (52 miles) to get into position ahead of Drake\\'s train between the Moro and Pine Bluff. That morning they were lying in ambush near the crossroad clearing, known as Mark\\'s Mills, just east of present-day Fordyce in Cleveland County. Forming line of battle, the 43rd Indiana\\'s Norris ordered his command to charge Fagan\\'s dismounted cavalry. As the charge commenced, Confederate General William Cabell\\'s mounted cavalry revealed itself from concealed positions in the trees on the south, or right flank. What began as a skirmish at around 8:30 am quickly developed into a very hot firefight with the Federals firing in two directions to beat off the assault. The well-aimed fire from the veteran Federal infantry was devastatingly effective and slowed Fagan\\'s advance. Drake ordered the train to pull off the road into an empty field and then ordered Major Hamilton to deploy the first battalion of the 36th Iowa Infantry up and onto the firing line on the 43rd Indiana\\'s left flank. Just as this battalion came on line, the Confederates charged the center and took another devastating musket volley from the Federals. Drake then ordered up Peetz\\'s 2nd Missouri Battery at the double-quick. As Peetz\\'s gun crews swung their guns into position, the Federal infantry was ordered to move to both flanks to open a hole in the center. This was done with alacrity and Peetz\\'s gun crews opened fire on the rebels with grapeshot at less than 200 yards. This stunned the Confederates, resulting in a momentary lull in the battle, but musket fire quickly resumed. As the Iowa and Indiana infantrymen were concentrating on the rebels to their front and right flank. General Jo Shelby\\'s two cavalry brigade swooped down on them from the left flank, where Shelby had waited in reserve for more than an hour. Three companies of the 36th Iowa, the entire 43rd Indiana and Captain Peetz\\'s battery of the Second Missouri Light Artillery were now pressed on three sides and were in danger of being encircled. Drake ordered the remainder of the 36th Iowa Infantry—five companies commanded by Captain Joseph Bull Gedney—into position at the extreme left flank. Drake sent an order to Gedney to support a cavalry charge into Cabell\\'s troops to push them back, prevent encirclement and attempt a link-up with the 77th Ohio, which was now moving forward to join the battle but still a mile to the rear. Before this message could be delivered however, Drake was wounded and fell from his horse from blood loss. The rebels proceeded to close the trap when Shelby made his charge on Gedney\\'s battalion. The Federal troops were surrounded, it quickly became a confused entanglement of small units fighting small units and then it became, according to Captain Seth Swiggett, \"Every man for himself.\" Shelby\\'s and Cabell\\'s troopers rushed down on the now disorganized Federals, capturing them in groups of two or three until there was no further resistance. Veteran survivors reported that the battle lasted fully five hours. Some men of the 36th Iowa\\'s first battalion took cover in the log cabins and kept up a withering and deadly fire, holding out from those protected positions until long after the others had surrendered, and until they exhausted their ammunition. When the insurgents threatened to burn the cabins down, the Iowans surrendered. In his after-action report, Cabell stated that 17 prisoners were taken from the larger of the two cabins. According to Captain Swiggett, when capture became certain, most of the Iowa men smashed their rifles against trees rather than hand them over to their captors. As the men of the 36th and 43rd Indiana were being rounded up and disarmed, a last-ditch effort to break into the Confederate ring by some brave federal cavalrymen created enough confusion and a diversion for some of the Iowa soldiers to bolt and escape. Several disappeared into the nearby woods and a few headed to the rear to warn the 77th Ohio of the overwhelming size of the enemy force to their front. Reaching a mounted captain of the 77th, the 36th Iowa men were accused of being deserters and their alarm was not heeded. The 77th\\'s commanding officer ordered his regiment forward at the double quick into the melee and soon that regiment was also overwhelmed by the three rebel cavalry divisions and compelled to surrender. The best casualty figures indicate that the 36th Iowa lost 42 killed outright and 89 wounded, of whom about 40 later died of their wounds. The remainder became prisoners and were force-marched to the notorious rebel prison stockade at Tyler, Texas. Some of the men who escaped evaded re-capture by moving across country, carefully avoiding rebel patrols. Half starved, exhausted and unarmed, some reached the safety of Union lines at Pine Bluff, while others managed to reach Little Rock. There they reported the news of what had befallen their comrades at Mark\\'s Mills. Colonel Powell Clayton, the federal commander at Pine Bluff, reported to General Sherman a few days after the battle that 186 Union cavalry and about 90 federal infantrymen had managed to escape and report in at Pine Bluff and at Little Rock. The 36th Iowa Infantry had ceased to exist by 3 pm on 25 April 1864. === The Battle of Jenkins\\' Ferry === Learning of the disaster at Mark\\'s Mills, Steele immediately put the VII Corps in motion from Camden on the morning of 26 April with the object of crossing the Saline River at Jenkins\\' Ferry and retiring to Little Rock. The corps made a forced march northeastward to the Saline, where high water necessitated the installation of a rubber pontoon bridge. Steele then moved his army across the swollen river, one wagon at a time, one gun limber at a time, and had three-quarters of his trains and artillery on the opposite bank when his rear-guard regiments were strongly attacked by the pursuing Confederates. In a savage battle that ranged through plowed fields on the south bank of the Saline, Steele\\'s troops poured volley after volley into the pursuing insurgents, first stalling their attack, and then turning it and buying time for the lead elements of the column to cross the pontoon bridge. Union infantry then made their crossing and took up guard from the opposite bank. Steele ordered the pontoon bridge to remain in place two more hours to enable wounded men and stragglers to be rescued. Then the bridge was destroyed in place, and allowed to sink into the river. While Steele\\'s Corps got bogged down on muddy roads north of the Saline, it managed to make a safe withdrawal to Little Rock. While the majority of 36th Iowa Infantry troops were captured at the Battle of Mark\\'s Mills, some men of the 2nd Brigade—including Thirty-sixth Iowa men who had been left behind sick in quarters at Camden—were not present with the regiment at Mark\\'s Mills. When Steele abandoned Camden therefore, these 36th Iowa remnants were assigned to a Casual Detachment under the command of Captain Marmaduke Darnall of the Forty-third Indiana, and these men fought bravely with the Casual Detachment in the Battle of Jenkins\\' Ferry. === Prisoners of war at Camp Ford === Some 240 men of the 36 Iowa Infantry Regiment were captured at Mark\\'s Mills. In the aftermath, those too seriously wounded to be moved were left under guard at the home of the Marks Family on whose property the battle had taken place, and in the care of the regiment\\'s medical aides. Lieutenant Colonel Drake, who had been seriously wounded by a bullet to the hip, was held only a week before being paroled and released. Drake returned to Iowa for treatment and convalescence. Meanwhile, several of the regiment\\'s battle dead were interred on the Marks Family property. The wounded and regimental medical aides were left under the supervision of Lieutenant Benjamin Pearson, B/36th. The Confederate soldiers assigned to remain at Marks Mills to guard the wounded federal soldiers had no medical supplies and, after a few days, they asked Lt. Pearson to travel into the Union lines at Pine Bluff and bring back food and medicine for the wounded. Pearson succeeded in this task, but he did not return to Marks Mills, instead sending the supplies back to Marks\\' Mills by a courier and then re-joining the federals and eventually making his way back to Little Rock. Pearson had not been wounded in the battle, and his selection as officer to remain behind with these seriously wounded soldiers may have been due to the fact that Pearson had served as a second chaplain with the regiment since its days at Helena. The Confederate victors of Marks Mills robbed the survivors of every valuable item they possessed, including hats, boots, watches, money and in some cases, the clothes on their backs. Overall, they were very roughly handled by their captors, according to Captain Swiggett. They were force-marched to the rebel prison at Camp Ford in Tyler, Texas, where dozens of them perished from disease over the next 12 months. Conditions at Camp Ford were primitive. Although a good spring provided cool clean water, and while the Confederate guards slaughtered cattle to supply the prisoners fresh beef regularly, the prisoners had no shelter from the sun or rain except improvised huts or blankets, and as the numbers of prisoners rose, the sanitary conditions declined precipitously, leading to many deaths from exposure, chronic diarrhea and disease. A number of the 36th Iowa\\'s officers escaped. Captain Swiggett twice escaped but was recaptured on both occasions and was rewarded for his bad behavior by being one of the last prisoners exchanged. Those who survived the horrors of Camp Ford were paroled on 25 February 1865, and exchanged at New Orleans on 28 February. After several days of recuperation there, the former prisoners were granted 30 days home leave, and started for Iowa. Those who were still deemed fit for duty returned to join the rest of the regiment—five small companies consisting of men not taken prisoner—at DeValls Bluff, Arkansas by 1 April 1865. In the months after Marks Mills and Jenkins Ferry, some 237 officers and men not captured at Marks Mills carried out garrison duty at Little Rock and later St. Charles Arkansas until the Confederacy surrendered. With more than a month left to serve, the reconstituted regiment—fortified with recently recruited volunteers—was sent as garrison troops at DeValls Bluff—the primary Federal supply depot on the upper White River. The regiment was mustered out of federal service at DeValls Bluff 24 August 1865. The veterans returned north to Davenport, Iowa, where they received their final Army pay and were dismissed from state service. === Postscript === The Union Army never controlled the territory of Southern Arkansas, but it occupied the capital and effectively took the state out of the war for all practical purposes and contained the threat to Missouri from Sterling Price in October 1864 and for the remainder of the war. Lieutenant Colonel Francis Drake, was promoted full Colonel on 8 May 1865 and shortly thereafter to Brigadier General. In a strange sequence of events, Colonel Charles W. Kittredge was court-martialed for habitual drunkenness and conduct unbecoming an officer in a 10-day trial at Little Rock in January 1865. Although acquitted by the court—which consisted of several of Kittredge\\'s old friends—the decision was overturned by Major General J.J. Reynolds, who had relieved Steele in command of VII Corps in November 1864. Reynolds sent a recommendation to President Lincoln that Kittredge be cashiered from the service. The War Department notified Kittredge of his dismissal in March. Kittredge, however, fought the decision and after much effort, secured his commission and command of the regiment on 15 August 1865-just ten days before the 36th Iowa was mustered out at DeValls Bluff. But few officers of the regiment paid any attention to the decision or to Kittredge, and they continued to take orders from Drake and Brevet Major William Vermillion. Kittredge seized a technical victory but he never restored his reputation with the officers and men of the 36th Iowa. The regimental colors of the Thirt-sixth Iowa Infantry are on display in the rotunda of the Iowa State Capital in Des Moines. === Officers of the Thirty-sixth Iowa Infantry at Mark\\'s Mills, 25 April 1864 === Lieutenant Colonel Francis M.

              " 'Gary D. Robson (May 11, 1958) is an American author from Red Lodge, Montana. He is best known for his children\\'s picture book series entitled Who Pooped in the Park?, which teaches children about animal scat and tracks. The series currently comprises 20 books, mostly set in United States National Parks. The 20th book in the series was released in 2016, covering Central Park in New York City. Robson is also an expert in closed captioning and subtitling technologies for deaf and hard of hearing people. == Biography == Robson was born in Poughkeepsie, New York in 1958 and grew up in Colorado, where he graduated from Boulder High School in 1976. He began writing for technical journals in 1984, and wrote a series of computer manuals before writing his first book in 1996 with Richard Sherman (a.k.a. Mr. Modem). He continued to write while working in the electronics industry until 2001, when he and his wife moved to Montana and purchased a bookstore. He was the publisher and editor-in-chief of the monthly alternative newspaper in Red Lodge, The Local Rag. === Closed captioning === Cheetah International, the company founded by Robson and his wife, began producing software and equipment for closed captioning in 1997, and Robson published articles on the subject for a variety of publications, including the Journal of Court Reporting, Newswaves, and Nuts & Volts. He holds two patents related to closed captioning: U.S. Patent #7,360,234 (2008) and U.S. Patent #8,245,252 B2 (2012). He was presented with the Andrew Saks Engineering Award for \"outstanding contributions in improving visual accessibility to information via realtime captioning for deaf and hard-of-hearing Americans\" by Telecommunications for the Deaf, Inc. in 1997. He wrote three books about closed captioning, most notably The Closed Captioning Handbook, published by Focal Press, then an imprint of Elsevier. He presented a TED Talk at TEDxBozeman in 2014 entitled, \"Does closed captioning still serve deaf people?\" == Works == === Children\\'s picture books === The Who Pooped in the Park? series is published by Farcountry Press in Helena, Montana. Each book in the series focuses on the indigenous wildlife of a particular National Park or ecosystem in the United States. Robson has used two different illustrators. Elijah Brady Clark illustrated the first six books, and Robert Rath has illustrated the rest.

              " 'Dense Pack is a strategy for basing intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) for the purpose of maximizing their survivability in case of a surprise nuclear first strike on their silos conducted by a hostile foreign power. The strategy was developed under the Reagan administration as a means of safeguarding America\\'s inventory of MX missiles during the final decade of the Cold War. It was never used; MX was deployed in existing silos and then removed from service as the Cold War ended. == MX basing debate == The U.S. commitments under the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty prevented the development and construction of adequate ABM installations around its nuclear missile silos. Therefore, it was decided that new and unconventional strategies for protecting these military assets from a sneak-attack had to be developed. The original concept had been to place the MX missile silos on the reverse side of tall hills or mesas. This was known as \"reverse inclination basing\". Enemy warheads approach at an angle of about 25° above horizontal, so if the slope of the hill was greater, the warhead would impact the hill short of the silo, outside its lethal range. This concept relies entirely on the warheads approaching from a certain direction, and as the Soviets introduced their Fractional Orbital Bombardment System and high-angle \"lofted\" trajectories, this no longer offered any extra protection. The introduction of submarine launched ballistic missiles, which could be launched from any direction, ended it as a useful concept. In 1979, after a long debate on the topic, President Jimmy Carter selected the \"multiple protective shelters\" concept for basing the MX. In this system, the 200 MX missiles would be partnered with many thousands of silos, and the missiles would be periodically moved among the silos so the Soviets would not know where they were. In order to attack the MX fleet and do any significant damage, they would have to attack every silo. With enough silos, they would use up much of their warhead inventory to destroy only 200 missiles, a cost that was so high they would not contemplate it. Derided as the \"racetrack\" proposal, the primary problem was that it required huge tracts of land. It was immediately opposed in Nevada, and finally fell out of favor in Utah when the Mormons turned against it as well. == Dense Pack == When Ronald Reagan took over in 1981 he agreed to reexamine the basing question, as opposition by Nevada senator Paul Laxalt had become overwhelming by this point. For the immediate future, 60 MX\\'s would be placed in surplus Titan II missile silos while a final basing solution was chosen. After an equally long and contentious debate, the Dense Pack system was chosen. The new strategy was mentioned in a speech by President Ronald Reagan in 1982.According to the Dense Pack strategy, a series of ten to twelve hardened silos would be grouped closely together in a line. This line of silos would generally run north-to-south, as the primary flight path for Soviet inbound nuclear missiles would be expected to come from the north over the North Pole. Each \"super-hardened\" silo would require an almost direct hit ground burst to destroy the missile within. When the first warhead went off, it would create a huge cloud of debris that was ejected thousands of feet into the sky. When the next warhead arrived it would hit this debris and be destroyed. Even if a warhead was successful in reaching the ground, it would create more dust and then lower the chance of the next one working. This basic idea had been considered during the Minuteman missile era under the name dust defense. In this case, it was US nuclear bombs buried near the silos that created the cloud of debris. This was abandoned because the \"dust\" would be extremely radioactive and millions would die when the resulting fallout fell back to the ground. In this case, however, it was Soviet warheads causing the fallout, which was politically acceptable. The proposed Dense Pack initiative met with strong criticism in the media and in the government, dismissed as \"duncepack\" or \"sixpack\". Detractors of the Dense Pack strategy pointed out a number of flaws. First, the advent of multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles, or MIRV, negated the concept due to their ability to conduct a time-on-target barrage. Since all the warheads were arriving from a single missile, they could easily be launched to arrive within seconds of each other. In this case, the explosions would not yet have created the massive cloud of dirt, and they would all fall largely unimpeded. Secondly, there were widespread doubts at the time that the hardened nature of the armored missile silos were as robust as the military claimed. If the silos could not survive a near-miss, then clustering the silos would allow a single warhead to destroy multiple silos, perhaps all of them. If the silos were not as hard as claimed, Dense Pack actually lowered their survival rate. Finally, Dense Pack was perceived by some to be a provocative, if not overtly hostile measure at a time when nuclear warfare seemed to be a distinct possibility. Ultimately, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected using the Dense Pack strategy by a 245–176 vote.The U.S. Air Force reconsidered the use of the Dense Pack strategy in 1986, at least in part to find a way to add 50 additional missiles authorized by Congress only if a \"safe\" basing strategy could be found. There is no evidence that the Dense Pack strategy was ever implemented. == References ==',\n",

              " \"Princess Gardens is a neighbourhood in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located in the western area of Toronto that was formerly the City of Etobicoke. Its boundaries are Eglinton Avenue to the north, Martin Grove to the west, Islington to the east, and Rathburn Road to the south. The southeastern part of this area is the separate neighbourhood of Thorncrest Village. The neighbourhood is divided into two areas: The portion east of Kipling Road is known as Princess Anne Manor, while the portion west of Kipling is Princess Margaret Gardens. They are named after Princess Anne, Princess Royal, and Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon, the daughter and sister of the late Queen Elizabeth II respectively. Both Princesses visited the Gardens and opened up Princess Margaret Public School during its opening ceremony. The southwestern part of the neighbourhood is also sometimes known as Glen Agar. Princess Gardens has some of the highest income Canadians in the Greater Toronto Area according to a 2016 census, at an average of $222,218 per year. == Character == This is a post-war developed residential area. Its main street is Eglinton Avenue, a four-lane arterial road running east–west along the north of the neighbourhood. Residential subdivisions back onto Eglinton along this stretch. North-south are Martin Grove, Kipling and Islington Avenues, all four-lane arterial roads with detached homes on both sides. The density of the housing is very low, and road patterns are generally curved roads leading into cul-de-sacs to reduce traffic. Largely built along an extension of the street 'The Kingsway' north of Dundas St, the area developed in a radically different manner than 'The Kingsway' neighbourhood to the south after the northern extension of the Kingsway was cut off from the south with the construction of a highway-style interchange at Dundas and Royal York. Like 'the Kingsway' neighbourhood to the south, many streets in Princess Gardens carry 'royal' names: The Kingsway, Prince George Dr, Princess Margaret Blvd, Princess Anne Cr. == Education == The neighbourhood is home to schools operated by the public Toronto District School Board (TDSB), and the Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB). TDSB is the only public school board that operates secondary schools in Princess Gardens, Martingrove Collegiate Institute and Richview Collegiate Institute. TDSB and TCDSB elementary schools located in Princess Gardens include: John G. Althouse Middle School is a middle school located in Toronto, Ontario, near the intersection of Lloyd Manor Drive and Princess Margaret Boulevard. St George's Junior School is a public elementary school on Princess Anne Crescent, located in the Princess Anne Manor community on the south side of Princess Margaret Boulevard. The school first opened in 1956 and expanded in 1960 to include additional classroom space. Rosethorn Junior School is a public elementary school on Remington Drive, located close to the intersection of Rathburn Road and Kipling Avenue. It first opened in 1952 as a kindergarten to grade 8 school, but was closed in 1984 because of declining enrolment. It reopened in September 1996 as a French Immersion kindergarten to grade 5 school.

He qualified for the 2016 Olympics by finishing in second place in the 3000 meters steeplechase at the 2016 United States Olympic Trials.Bor attended Arnesens High School south of Eldoret, where he ran a 9:15 steeplechase and was district champion in the long jump and pole vault. He also ran a 3:55 1500 meters in high school. In 2007 he won a scholarship to Iowa State University, where he placed fourth in the steeplechase at the 2008 NCAA Championships in 8:36.84 earning All-American status. He improved that to second place in 2009 and added an Academic All American status to another All American improving his personal best to 8:35.12. In 2010 he finished third at the NCAAs. His senior year earned him second team Academic All American.His older brothers Emmanuel and Julius Bor also ran for an American college, the University of Alabama. The brothers found a path to citizenship in the country of their education by joining the United States Army. While serving on different bases, the three teamed up to win the All Armed Forces Cross Country Championships in February 2016. All three were in the top 20 of the USA Cross Country Championships, Hillary finishing eighth.Bor's time of 8:30.70 in the steeplechase at the April 2016 Stanford Invitational was the world leading time at that point of the season. At the Olympic Trials, Bor was running in fifth place well behind Evan Jager's lead position. Another Kenyan-American, Stanley Kebenei was the closest to Jager but began to fade as Bor, Andy Bayer and Donn Cabral were chasing. The diminutive Bor made up over ten meters on the backstretch and had passed Cabral before the water jump. As he passed Bayer on the outside their two elbows made contact. On the outside, Bor was clean over the water jump and off to the races after Jager, on the inside Kebenei was unable to find his way out of the pit and fell onto all fours, causing Cabral to have to make an extra barrier jump over his body while Bayer sidestepped the fall but was losing ground chasing Bor. Perhaps angered by the incident, Cabral took off sprinting, catching Bayer who was unable to respond and tied up going into the finish. Bor's last lap was the fastest of the field. His time of 8:24.10 was a new personal best. After the race, the Nike Bowerman team filed a protest against Bor (the only non-Nike athlete in the final five) that was unsuccessful.In 2017, he competed in the men's 3000 metres steeplechase at the 2017 World Athletics Championships held in London, United Kingdom. == References == == External links == U.S. Army World Class Athlete Program profile\",\n",
              " 'The Young–Quinlan Building was erected at 901 Nicollet Avenue, Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1926. Elizabeth Quinlan and her partner, Fred D. Young, owned and operated a women\\'s specialty dress shop when Young died in 1911. Miss Quinlan decided to expand her business and, wanting to have the best in design, consulted with department store managers and owners in New York and Chicago. She hired Frederick L. Ackerman of New York to design a \"\\'beautiful home\\' for her merchandise.\" The local associate architects were Magney & Tusler.Unique to the design of the building is making each of the four facades as if it were the front facade. Typically, commercial buildings were designed to have a street facade that would be the most attractive and welcoming side because it was assumed that other sides would be hidden by adjacent construction. The facades of the Young–Quinlan building look the same with arched windows, columns and decorative elements giving each side the appearance of being the entrance side of the building. A parking garage, a modern innovation for the time, was also included in the construction of the building. The building was clad with rusticated Kasota limestone on the first floor, with brick walls above and stone pilasters and columns surrounding windows. The interior has a marble staircase, crystal chandeliers, and metalwork of iron, brass, bronze, and pewter. One distinctive feature was the last elevator in the city still operated by an elevator operator.In 1979 staff at the City Planning Department of the Office of the Mayor recommended that the exterior of the building be awarded preservation status. In 1985, renovation of the building for use by multiple tenants was begun by the owners, The 614 Company, and three years later the company sought historic designation from the Minneapolis City Council. The building was designated as a local landmark by the Minneapolis Historic Preservation Commission in 1988. == References ==',\n",
              " 'Xandria was one of the largest distributors of sex toys and adult videos, books and novelty items in the United States. It began as a catalog of sexual aids for people with disabilities at a time when the disability rights movement was in its infancy. Xandria was also one of the first companies to sell sex-related items online. The business closed in 2016 when Lawrence Research Group, Inc., which operated the business, filed for dissolution with the Nevada Secretary of State. == Xandria History == Xandria was founded in 1974 by Gaye Raymond, a San Francisco physical therapy professor, and her husband, Victoria\\'s Secret founder Roy Raymond. Gaye Raymond\\'s philosophy was that people with disabilities should be able to enjoy as much of life as possible, including an active sex life. Xandria began as a catalog-based distributor of sexual aids for people with physical and developmental disabilities.The original Xandria Collection offered mostly educational adult videos and books, as well as vibrators and sex toys that were easier to grasp and maneuver by people who had physical impairments due to an amputation or illness. The company\\'s guarantee of privacy, product quality and personal satisfaction helped it develop a following among the general public, especially among those who didn\\'t want to be seen entering their local porn shop.Xandria\\'s products were shipped in discreet packages that did not bear the company\\'s name. Customers could request a refund within 60 days if they were not satisfied with their sex toys for any reason.Gaye and Roy Raymond sold the Xandria Collection in 1984 and the company\\'s inventory was expanded to appeal to the general public. In addition to a catalog for people with disabilities, the company began selling condoms, erotica, dildos, lubricants, vibrating cock rings, triple crowns, penis pumps, lingerie, masturbation aids, and other sex-related products. In 1999, it also began carrying explicit sex videos distributed by sister company 1st Skin. The company\\'s new owners also created an advisory board of health and sex experts. Members included sex educator, activist and author Betty Dodson; journalist and author Michael Castleman, who penned the Playboy Magazine Advisor from 1991 to 1995; and clinical psychologist Louanne Cole, who now serves as resident expert for WebMD\\'s \"Sex Matters.\" Xandria was initially headquartered in San Francisco. It moved to Brisbane, California in 1993 and to its final location in the Las Vegas Valley in 2005. In 1997, the company launched Xandria.com, one of the first online stores dedicated to selling sex toys and adult videos. The site and the company itself have generated positive press from well-known publications such as Playboy, Esquire, Hustler, and Men\\'s Fitness.In its final phase, customers could order items through the mail and by calling a toll free number, but most of the company\\'s sales were generated through its website. Xandria did not have a physical store. Xandria.com carried a long list of sex-related items, as well as articles on sexual health written by well-known authors.

              " \"Platanthera yadonii, also known as Yadon's piperia or Yadon's rein orchid, is an endangered orchid endemic to a narrow range of coastal habitat in northern Monterey County, California. In 1998 this plant was designated as an endangered species by the United States government, the major threat to its survival being continuing land development from an expanding human population and associated habitat loss. One of the habitats of Yadon's piperia, the Del Monte Forest near Monterey, California, is the subject of a federal lawsuit, based upon endangerment of this organism along with several other endangered species. This wildflower may lie dormant in a given year and not emerge above the soil surface from its tuberous substructure. After leafing out in the spring, it will produce flowers on erect spikes, each flower possessing both green and white petals. It prefers sandy soils, and subsists on nutrient extraction from intermediate fungal organisms. == Description == Along with most other orchids P. yadonii: (a) is a bisexual perennial green plant that grows from buried tubers; manifests a fruit capsule bearing numerous minute seeds; (b) exhibits pollen that is sticky, and which is removed as sessile anther sacs; and (c) has a stigma fused with its style into a column. Yadon's piperia exhibits a basal rosette leaf formation. The subsurface architecture of this terrestrial wild orchid consists of a rhizome structure, from which emanate tubers. The rhizome extracts nutrients from fungal intermediates and may also store some of these nutrients. A basal rosette of leaves develops from the tuber at the surface of the soil, each of the two or three leaves being lanceolate in shape. Each leaf ranges from 10 to 15 centimeters in length and 20 to 35 millimeters in width. Leaves of younger plants are often more diminutive in size. The dense inflorescence is borne on a single erect vertical spike varying from 12 to 55 centimeters in height. Each flower has a spur of length 1.5 to 5 millimeters, short compared to other members of the genus. Yadon's Piperia typically presents three upper tepals, each of which contains both green and white pigmentation; moreover, there are three lower tepals that are white only. The earliest blooming time is June. When P. yadonii blooms, as late as August, all of its sepals and petals may be purely white. Another key identification feature is the characteristically abbreviated spur, which typically measures 1.5 to 6.0 millimeters in length. P. yadonii's leaves usually wither by blooming time, except for a small percentage of very large individuals. The geographic range of P. yadonii overlaps that of P. elegans, P. elongata, P. michaelii, and P. transversa; consequently, P. yadonii is clearly distinguished from them only in the flowering stage. Sympatric occurrences in mixed populations with P. elongata and P. elegans are noted in the literature. == Reproduction and symbiosis == Seeds of this species, like other orchids, lack an endosperm. The extremely small seeds must come in contact with appropriate soil fungi in order to germinate. The resulting seedlings obtain fixed carbon from the fungus until they produce their first leaves and begin to photosynthesize. This strategy is known as myco-heterotrophy. Vegetative reproduction may also occur. == Distribution and habitat == Yadon's piperia is confined to a handful of locations in the coastal area of north Monterey County primarily the Del Monte Forest on the Monterey Peninsula. Tiny populations have been found in the Prunedale Hills; and an isolated southernmost population on Rocky Creek Ridge (Cushing Mountain) at Big Sur. Specific places of occurrence within those areas are the S.F.B. Morse Botanical Reserve; Manzanita County Park; and the Nature Conservancy’s Blohm Ranch Nature Preserve. Each colony is rather small in patch size, measured on the order of twenty acres or less. All of the occurrences are below about 250 meters above mean sea level and all are within six miles of the Pacific Ocean. Yadon's piperia is generally restricted to three habitats: (a) Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) forest, sometimes with Gowen's cypress (Cupressus goveniana ssp. goveniana) which includes more than 80 percent of the known populations; (b) California Northern coastal scrub, with dwarfed Hooker's manzanita (Arctostaphylos hookeri ssp. hookeri) or Eastwood's manzanita (Arctostaphylos glandulosa); and (c) Monterey cypress (Cupressus macrocarpa) forest. The colonies in woodland settings are found under partial canopy in an open, primarily herbaceous understory shape. The Monterey Peninsula and northern Big Sur areas are influenced by a marine climate that is pronounced due to the upwelling of cool water from the Monterey submarine canyon. Rainfall is 40 to 50 centimeters per year, but summer fog drip is a primary source of moisture for Yadon's Piperia and other plants that would otherwise not be able to persist with such low precipitation. == History and conservation == Platanthera yadonii was named for Vern Yadon, former longtime director of the Pacific Grove Museum of Natural History. The Monterey Peninsula, where all colonies of Yadon's piperia occur, is recognized to have a high degree of species endemicism. Species with more northern ranges often reach their southern limits on the Peninsula; species with more southern affinities reach their northern limits there as well. On the Monterey Peninsula some taxa comprising habitat for P. yadonii, such as the coastal closed-cone pines and cypresses are relict stands, e.g. species that once extended more widely in the mesic climate of the late Pleistocene period, but then retreated to small pockets of cooler and wetter conditions along the coast ranges during the hotter, drier early Holocene period between 6000 and 2000 BC.Yadon's piperia, along with certain other threatened species in the northern California Floristic Province, has been designated as a species meriting protection by the U.S. Government, State of California, local governments and private conservation groups. These designations have led to blueprints for protection of Yadon's piperia in the form of official endangerment classifications and a species Recovery Plan, the latter promulgated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Even with all these efforts, the total current population is not necessarily above the minimum viable population without further elements of protection. The listing as a federally endangered species occurred in 1998, prompted by a study conducted by Earth Metrics for the city of Monterey, which found the colony in the Del Monte forest to be threatened by proposed land development. Subsequently, in 1995 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service acted on this new information regarding Yadon's piperia, and promulgated a notice of intent to classify the species as endangered. Monitoring populations of Yadon's piperia is challenging since each tuber does not produce emergent leaves or flowers in a given year. To complicate matters further, the plant can only be identified conclusively in its flowering stage, and yet, even when the plant leafs out, it may not necessarily produce a flower in a given year. Furthermore, by the time a flower is produced, the leaves have typically senesced; thus, a survey conducted during the flowering season will miss plants that have leafed out but not flowered. == See also == Platanthera elegans Hickman's potentilla Minimum viable population == References == == External links == Data related to Platanthera yadonii (Piperia yadonii) at Wikispecies Calflora: Piperia yadonii (Yadon's piperia, Yadon's rein orchid) USDA Plants Profile for Piperia yadonii (Yadon's piperia) Jepson eFlora: Piperia yadonii U.S.EPA endangered species listing detail for P. yadonii U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service species profile for P. yadonii Piperia yadonii — UC Photos gallery\",\n",

His father, Senator John Morrow Godfrey (June 28, 1912 – March 8, 2001), was a Canadian pilot, lawyer and politician. John Godfrey graduated from Upper Canada College in 1960. In 1961, he attended the Neuchâtel Junior College in Neuchâtel, Switzerland.In 1965, he received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Trinity College, University of Toronto and in 1967, he received a Master of Philosophy from Balliol College, Oxford and Doctor of Philosophy (DPhil) from St Antony\\'s College, Oxford in 1975. He worked as an economist, historian and journalist. In the mid-1970s Godfrey was a history professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax. He served as president of the University of King\\'s College from 1977-87. From 1987 to 1991 he was editor of the Financial Post. == Politics == He was elected to the House of Commons of Canada as the Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for the Toronto area riding of Don Valley West in the 1993 election, and was re-elected in each subsequent vote until his retirement from federal politics in 2008.During the 1995 Quebec referendum, Godfrey had an acquaintance perform a psychiatric evaluation of separatist leader Lucien Bouchard.In 1996, he and fellow Liberal MP Peter Milliken introduced the Godfrey–Milliken Bill a parody of the American Helms–Burton Act. The gesture received extensive media coverage including in the United States, where Godfrey was featured on the CBS program 60 Minutes. From 1996 to 2004, Godfrey served as a Parliamentary Secretary under Prime Minister Jean Chrétien. == Minister of State for Infrastructure and Communities == In 2003, Paul Martin succeeded Chrétien as Liberal leader and prime minister. Following the subsequent 2004 election, Godfrey, among other key Martin allies, was appointed to the Cabinet in the role of Minister of State for Infrastructure and Communities. In this role, he was primarily responsible for overseeing the \"New Deal for Cities\", Federation of Canadian Municipalities relationship, and other initiatives in Canadian federal-municipal relations.

Godfrey declared his candidacy on Goldhawk Live on March 19, shortly after the rules and convention date were set. Media reaction was positive, but competed with coverage of Ashley MacIsaac, who declared his intention to run to the Halifax Daily News the next day. In the early stages of the campaign he was recurrently cited as exemplar of intellectualism in the race, being one of three former university professors in the running. Name-recognition remained a challenge, but Godfrey received plaudits in the Canadian blogosphere for his performance in the first all-candidates meeting at the Liberal Party of Alberta convention on April 8. On April 12, 2006, Godfrey announced his withdrawal from the race, due to concerns about his health. On October 20, 2006, Godfrey announced his support for Bob Rae for the federal Liberal leadership. He made the announcement at the National Press Club, on the occasion of a speech by Rae on the environment. == Leaving politics == Godfrey announced in November 2007 his intention to resign his parliamentary seat on July 1, 2008 and would leave earlier if an election were called before that date. He later delayed his resignation date until August 1. The Conservative Party alleged that the Liberals chose to delay the by-election for financial reasons though Godfrey\\'s office stated that the delay was due to a private members bill Godfrey had worked on not being given Royal Assent until June 26.On June 17, in a point of order following Question Period, Godfrey gave his resignation speech to the House of Commons. == Headmaster of the Toronto French School == John Godfrey left politics to become Headmaster of the Toronto French School, an independent school in the Lawrence Park area with two campuses in Toronto.

The first issue of the newspaper was first published in January 1861 in an edition of 7000 copies.From 1861 to 1894 it was published by Julius Grégr; since 1874 it was the main newspaper of the Young Czech Party. The Grégr family owned and published the newspaper up until 1910; when it was transferred to the printing house Pražská akciová tiskárna founded by two other members of the Young Czech Party, Karel Kramář and Alois Rašín.In October 1917, brothers Josef Čapek and Karel Čapek joined the staff as writers, but they left in April 1921 when the paper shifted toward increasingly narrow nationalistic orientations. The paper was briefly suspended a few months before Czechoslovak Independence Day (28 October 1918). From 1918 to 1938 it was the main newspaper of National Democratic Party (Czechoslovakia) and the National Unification, both led by Karel Kramář. After the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia, it operated as the newspaper of National Partnership, the only political party that was allowed. In April 1941 it ceased its publishing. == Prominent Editors == Jan Neruda, Vitezslav Hálek, Karel Sladkovský, editor Josef Anýž, Karel Čapek, Chod Matthew, Josef Čapek, Viktor Dyk, Jindriska Konopásková, Jakub Arbes . == References ==',\n",

              " 'Monster is a 2008 direct-to-video kaiju film. An international co-production of Japan and the United States, it is a mockbuster created to capitalize on the release of Cloverfield. It was released direct-to-DVD on January 15, 2008. Cloverfield was released theatrically three days later on January 18, 2008. == Plot == The film takes place in Tokyo in 2003, where two reporters, Erin and Sarah Lynch, have arrived to document unusual seismic disturbances that have been picked up around Tokyo. The disturbances are originally thought to be aftershocks left over from a supposed massive earthquake on the Kanto Fault that occurred two years previously, causing hundreds of thousands of casualties and several hundred billion dollars in damage (possibly referencing the real-life Fukuoka earthquake or the Miyagi earthquake), although careful analysis of the evidence suggests otherwise. As time goes on, all of Tokyo begins to suffer from abnormal earth tremors similar to those registered in 2005. The tremors are found not to be caused by an earthquake, but by a gigantic octopus that has been dormant for centuries. It has since been awakened by mankind and now sees Tokyo as a new feeding-ground; the filmmakers document the catastrophe as it unfolds. It starts as Erin and Sarah are talking about filming Tokyo. The scene then switches to the interior of Erin\\'s car as the two drive to LAX, to catch their flight to Tokyo. In Tokyo they rent a hotel room, and, the next day, Sarah films Erin talking with the global warming minister. During the interview, an earthquake strikes and the scene again switches to the reporters in the basement of the environmental building. They find a survivor named Justin Robbins, and as they flee, they hear the sounds of panic and plane engines from a tunnel. Later, they find a mall, and another earthquake occurs. In the chaos, Justin is impaled by a pole as the reporters flee in panic. Some small text appears on the screen saying that tape #3 was damaged. As the reporters run toward a mall they find a woman (Aiko) and her grandfather, and they eat and sleep, Erin not realizing she had left the camera turned on. Then, another earthquake begins and kills the grandfather as the woman tells the reporters to flee. They hear the mall explode as they run away and soon find a building which they enter. They have gone upstairs when the building suddenly collapses. The reporters survive, but the collapse damages the camera lens. Night arrives and they see helicopters ready to save refugees, but a tentacle destroys them and proceeds to throw cars at the people, killing many of them. Panic ensues, and Sarah abandons Erin. A tentacle slams into the ground where Erin is and she is wounded. Additionally, the camera\\'s batteries run low. Sarah cries for Erin as the crash of a tentacle hitting the ground is heard, ending the film, which indicates that the reporters were crushed by the monster and were among the thousands, if not millions, killed. == Reception == The few reviews of Monster that have been posted online have been extremely negative. In an audio review, Scott Foy of Dread Central parodied the movie\\'s found footage premise, pretending that the abysmal film was slowly driving him insane. The review ended with Foy supposedly jumping out a window. (He later said that some listeners believed he actually had gone mad.) Foy named Monster the \"Worst Direct-to-DVD Horror Movie of 2008\" in a later podcast. Other reviewers called the film\\'s pacing \"horrendous\", and described the movie as \"terrible\" and \"astoundingly dull\". == See also == Cloverfield, another monster film released in the same year List of killer octopus films == References == == External links == Official website Monster at IMDb',\n",
              " 'The concerto delle donne (lit. \\'consort of ladies\\'; also concerto di donne or concerto delle (or di) dame) was a group of professional female singers in the late Italian Renaissance, primarily in the court of Ferrara, Italy. Renowned for their technical and artistic virtuosity, the ensemble was founded by Alfonso II, Duke of Ferrara, in 1580 and was active until the court was dissolved in 1597. Giacomo Vincenti, a music publisher, praised the women as \"virtuose giovani\" (young virtuosas), echoing the sentiments of contemporaneous diarists and commentators.The origins of the ensemble lay in an amateur group of high-placed courtiers who performed for each other within the context of the Duke\\'s informal musica secreta (lit. \\'secret music\\') in the 1570s. The ensemble evolved into an all-female group of professional musicians, the concerto delle donne, who performed formal concerts for members of the inner circle of the court and important visitors. Their signature style of florid, highly ornamented singing brought prestige to Ferrara and inspired composers of the time. The concerto delle donne revolutionized the role of women in professional music, and continued the tradition of the Este court as a musical center. Word of the ladies\\' ensemble spread across Italy, inspiring imitations in the powerful courts of the Medici and Orsini. The founding of the concerto delle donne was the most important event in secular Italian music in the late sixteenth century; the musical innovations established in the court were important in the development of the madrigal, and eventually the seconda pratica. == History == === Formation === At the court in Ferrara, a collection of ladies skilled in music inspired the composer Luzzasco Luzzaschi and caught the interest of Alfonso II d\\'Este, Duke of Ferrara. This group, which led to the formation of the concerto delle donne (lit. \\'consort of ladies\\'), performed within the context of the Duke\\'s musica secreta (lit. \\'secret music\\'), a regular series of chamber music concerts performed for a private audience. This preliminary group was originally made up of talented but amateur members of the court: the sisters Lucrezia and Isabella Bendidio, as well as Leonora Sanvitale, and Vittoria Bentivoglio. They were joined by bass Giulio Cesare Brancaccio, who was brought to the court in 1577 for his singing abilities. The preliminary ensemble was active throughout the 1570s, and its membership solidified in 1577. Only later did professionals replace these original singers. The Duke did not announce the creation of a professional, all-female ensemble; instead, the group infiltrated and gradually dominated the musica secreta, so that after the dismissal of Brancaccio for insubordination in 1583, no more male members of the musica secreta were hired. Even when Brancaccio was performing with the consort it was referred to as a ladies\\' ensemble, because women singing together was the most exciting aspect of the group. This new ensemble, the concerto delle donne, was created by the Duke in part to amuse his young new wife, Margherita Gonzaga d\\'Este (she was only fourteen when they wed in 1579), and in part to help the Duke achieve his artistic goals for the court. According to Grana, a contemporary correspondent, \"Signora Machiavella [Lucrezia], Signora Isabella, and Signora Vittoria have abandoned the field, having lost the backing of Luzzaschi\". The first recorded performance by the professional ladies was on November 20, 1580; by the 1581 carnival season, they were performing together regularly.This new \"consort of ladies\" was viewed as an extraordinary and novel phenomenon; most witnesses did not connect the second period of the concerto delle donne with the group of ladies who sang in the musica secreta. However, modern musicologists now view the earlier group as a crucial part of the creation and development of the social and vocal genre of the concerto delle donne. === Roster and duties === The most prominent member of the new ensemble was Laura Peverara, followed by Livia d\\'Arco and Anna Guarini, daughter of the prolific poet Giovanni Battista Guarini. Giovanni wrote poems for many of the madrigals which were set for the ensemble, and choreographed scenes for the balletto delle donne. Judith Tick believes Tarquinia Molza sang with the group, but Anthony Newcomb says she was involved solely as an advisor and instructor. Whether Tarquinia Molza ever performed with them or not, she was ousted from any role in the group after her affair with the composer Giaches de Wert came to light in 1589. Luzzasco Luzzaschi directed and composed music to showcase the ensemble, and accompanied them on the harpsichord. Ippolito Fiorini was the maestro di capella, in charge of the entire court\\'s musical activities. In addition to his duties to the overall court, he accompanied the concerto on the lute. Vittorio Baldini was brought to the court as ducal music printer in 1582.The singers of the second era of the concerto delle donne were officially ladies-in-waiting of Duchess Margherita Gonzaga d\\'Este, but were hired primarily as singers. Peverara\\'s musical abilities prompted the Duke to specifically ask his wife Margherita to bring Peverara from Mantua as part of her retinue. The new singers played instruments, including the lute, harp, and viol, but focused their energies on developing vocal virtuosity. This skill became highly prized in the mid-sixteenth century, beginning with basses like Brancaccio, but by the end of the century virtuosic bass singing went out of style, and higher voices came into vogue. The ladies\\' musical duties included performing with the duchess\\' balletto delle donne, a group of female dancers who frequently crossdressed. Despite their upper-class background, the singers would not have been welcomed into the court\\'s inner circle had they not been such skilled performers. D\\'Arco belonged to the nobility, but a minor family only. Peverara was the daughter of a wealthy merchant, and Molza came from a prominent family of artists.The women performed up to six hours a day, either singing their own florid repertoire from memory, sight-reading from partbooks, or participating in the balletti as singers and dancers. Thomasin LaMay posits that the women of the concerti delle donne provided sexual favors for members of the court, but there is no evidence for this, and the circumstances of their marriages and dowries argues against this interpretation. The women were paid salaries and received other benefits, such as dowries and apartments in the ducal palace. Peverara received 300 scudi a year and lodging in the ducal palace for herself, her husband, and her mother – as well as a dowry of 10,000 scudi upon her marriage.Despite having married three times in the hopes of producing an heir, Alfonso II died in 1597 without issue, legitimate or otherwise. His cousin Cesare inherited the Duchy, but the city of Ferrara, which was legally a Papal fief, was annexed to the Papal States in 1598 through a combination of \"firm diplomacy and unscrupulous pressure\" by Pope Clement VIII. The Este court had to abandon Ferrara in disarray and the concerto delle donne was disbanded. == Music == The greatest musical innovation of the concerto delle donne was the multiplication of the ornamented upper voices, from one voice singing diminutions above an instrumental accompaniment to two or three voices singing varying diminutions at once. This practice, which listeners found remarkable, was imitated by many composers, including Carlo Gesualdo, Luca Marenzio and Claudio Monteverdi.These composers wrote music either inspired by the concerto delle donne or specifically for them. Such works are characterized by a high tessitura, a virtuosic and florid style, and a wide range. Lodovico Agostini\\'s third book of madrigals was perhaps the first publication fully dedicated to the new singing style. Agostini dedicated songs to Guarini, Peverara, and Luzzaschi. Gesualdo wrote music for the group in 1594 while visiting Ferrara to marry the Duke\\'s niece Leonora d\\'Este. De Wert\\'s Seventh Book of Madrigals à 5 and Marenzio\\'s First Book à 6 were the first true musical monuments to the new concerto delle donne. Monteverdi\\'s Canzonette a tre voci was probably influenced by the \"Ladies of Ferrara\". Although the only works clearly intended for or inspired by the concerto delle donne were works for multiple high voices executing written-out diminutions, in practice concerts with the concerto delle donne included the older style of solo ornamented madrigals with instrumental accompaniment. Peverara was singularly lauded for her skill in this genre. Works written for the concerto delle donne were not limited to music: Torquato Tasso and G.B. Guarini wrote poems dedicated to the ladies in the concerto, some of which were later set by composers. Tasso wrote over seventy-five poems to Peverara alone.Luzzaschi\\'s book of madrigals for one, two, and three sopranos with keyboard accompaniment, published in 1601, comprises works written throughout the 1580s. This music may have been kept back from publication in order to maintain the secrecy of Alfonso\\'s musica secreta, and to maintain control over it. Newcomb considers this publication the exemplar of the ladies\\' signature musical style. In 1584, Alessandro Striggio, responding to requests from Francesco I de\\' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, described the ladies and composed pieces imitating their style so that Francesco could start his own concerto delle donne. Striggio mentioned an ornamented four voice madrigal for three sopranos and a dialogue with imitative diminutions for two sopranos. He added that he had forgotten the intabulation for the madrigal in Mantua, and noted that the skilled singer Giulio Caccini could play the bass part on either lute or harpsichord. This indicates both that male singers were probably not used after Brancaccio, and that instrumental accompaniments were a common and acceptable means of filling in the counterpoint.The output of the ducal printer, Baldini, consisted largely of music written for the concerto delle donne, including the works of the foremost madrigalists: Luzzaschi, Gesualdo, and Alfonso Fontanelli. His first publication for the Duke was Il lauro secco (1582), which was followed by Il lauro verde (1583), both containing music by the leading composers of Rome and Northern Italy. Music in honor of the concerto was printed as far away as Venice, with Paolo Virchi\\'s First Book à 5, published by Giacomo Vincenti and Ricciardo Amadino containing the madrigal which begins SeGU\\'ARINAscer LAURA e prenda LARCO / Amor soave e dolce / Ch\\'ogni cor duro MOLCE. This capitalization is in the original, clearly spelling out the equivalent of the names Anna Guarini, Laura Peverara, Livia d\\'Arco, and Tarquinia Molza.With the obvious exception of Brancaccio, all the singers in the concerto were female sopranos. Although the music written for the concerto focused on high voices, there is no evidence that the ensemble used either castrati or falsettists. This fact is surprising, considering that castrati were shortly to become the biggest stars of a new art form, opera. In 1607, Monteverdi\\'s Orfeo featured four castrato roles out of a cast of nine, showing the new dominance of this vocal type. It also contrasts with Margherita\\'s father\\'s court, where Guglielmo Gonzaga actively sought out eunuchs.Polyphonic arrangements called for the women to sing diminutions (melodic divisions of longer notes) and other ornaments in consort. Diminutions were traditionally improvised in performance. However, to coordinate their voices, they transcribed and rehearsed the music in advance, transforming these improvisations into highly developed musical forms that composers would emulate. The singers may have used the more traditional practice in their solo repertoire, performing ornaments extemporaneously. Specific ornaments used by the concerto delle donne, mentioned in a source from 1581, were such popular sixteenth-century devices as passaggi (division of a long note into many shorter notes, usually stepwise), cadenze (decoration of the penultimate note, sometimes quite elaborate), and tirate (rapid scales). Accenti (connection of two longer notes, using dotted rhythms), a staple of early Baroque music, are absent from the list. In 1592 Caccini claimed that Alfonso II asked him to teach his ladies the new accenti and passaggi styles. === Styles === There are two separate styles of madrigals written for and inspired by the concerto delle donne. The first is the \"luxuriant\" style of the 1580s. The second is music in the style of the seconda pratica, written in the 1590s. Luzzaschi wrote music in both of these styles. The style of the earlier period, as exemplified in the works of Luzzaschi, involves the use of madrigal texts written by poets within the Ferrarese sphere, such as Tasso and G.B. Guarini. These poems tend to be short and witty with single sections. Musically, Luzzaschi\\'s works are highly sectionalized and based on melodic themes, rather than harmonic structures. Luzzaschi lessens the sectionalizing effect of his compositional techniques by weakening cadences. His tendency to reiterate melodies in different voices, including the bass voice, leads to tonal creations which are sometimes bewildering. These aspects make Luzzaschi\\'s music much more polyphonic than Monteverdi\\'s later compositions, and thus more conservative; however, Luzzaschi\\'s use of jarring melodic leaps and harmonic dissonance are individualistic. These dissonances, which contrast sharply with the careful treatment of dissonance during most of the 16th century, is closely connected with the ornamented polyphonic madrigals of the concerto delle donne. In Giovanni Artusi\\'s socratic dialogue, the character defending Monteverdi connects haphazard treatment of dissonance with ornamental singing. === Performance === The concerto delle donne transformed the musica secreta. In the past, members of the audience would perform, and performers would become audience members. During the ascendancy of the concerto delle donne the roles within the musica secreta became fixed, as did the roster of those who performed for the Duke\\'s pleasure every night.The elite, hand-selected audience members favored with admission to performances by the concerto delle donne demanded diversions and entertainment beyond the pleasures of beautiful music alone. During the concerts, members of the concerto\\'s audience would sometimes play cards. Orazio Urbani, ambassador of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, having waited several years to see the concerto, complained that he was forced not only to play cards, distracting him from the performance, but also simultaneously admire and praise the women\\'s music to their patron Alfonso. After at least one concert, to continue the entertainment, a dwarf couple danced. Alfonso was not as interested in these peripheral entertainments, and in one instance excused himself from the party to go sit under a tree to listen to the ladies, and follow along with the madrigal texts and musical scores, including embellishments, which were made available to listeners. == Influence == The concerto delle donne was a revolutionary musical establishment that helped effect a shift in women\\'s role in music; its success took women from obscurity to \"the apex of the profession\". Women were openly brought to court to train as professional musicians, and by 1600, a woman could have a viable career as a musician, independent of her husband or father. New women\\'s ensembles inspired by the concerto delle donne resulted in more positions for women as professional singers and more music for them to perform.Despite the dissolution of the court in 1597, the musical style which was inspired by the concerto delle donne spread throughout Europe, and remained prominent for almost fifty years. The concerto delle donne was so influential and often imitated that it became a cliché of northern Italian courts. It heavily influenced the development of the madrigal and eventually the seconda practica. The group\\' brought Alfonso and his court international prestige, as the ladies\\' reputation spread throughout Italy and southern Germany. It functioned as a powerful tool of propaganda, projecting an image of strength and affluence.Having seen the concerto delle donne in Ferrara, Caccini created a rival group made up of his family and a pupil. This ensemble was sponsored by the Medici, and traveled as far abroad as Paris to perform for Marie de\\' Medici. Francesca Caccini had much success composing and singing in the style of the concerto delle donne. Beginning in 1585, rival groups were created in Florence by the Medici, Rome by the Orsini, and Mantua by the Gonzaga. There was even a rival group in Ferrara based in the Castello Estense, the very palace where the concerto delle donne performed. This group was formed by Alfonso\\'s sister Lucrezia d\\'Este, Duchess of Urbino. She had lived at the Este court since 1576, and shortly after Margherita\\'s marriage to Alfonso in 1579, Alfonso and his henchmen killed Lucrezia\\'s lover. Lucrezia was unhappy about being replaced as the matron of the house by Margherita, and upset by the murder of her lover, leading to her desire to be separate from the rest of her family during her evening entertainments.Barbara Strozzi was among the last composers and performers in this style, which by the mid-seventeenth century was considered archaic. == Notes == == Citations == == References == Grove sources',\n",
              " 'In finance, the rule of 72, the rule of 70 and the rule of 69.3 are methods for estimating an investment\\'s doubling time. The rule number (e.g., 72) is divided by the interest percentage per period (usually years) to obtain the approximate number of periods required for doubling. Although scientific calculators and spreadsheet programs have functions to find the accurate doubling time, the rules are useful for mental calculations and when only a basic calculator is available.These rules apply to exponential growth and are therefore used for compound interest as opposed to simple interest calculations. They can also be used for decay to obtain a halving time. The choice of number is mostly a matter of preference: 69 is more accurate for continuous compounding, while 72 works well in common interest situations and is more easily divisible. There are a number of variations to the rules that improve accuracy. For periodic compounding, the exact doubling time for an interest rate of r percent per period is t = ln \\u2061 ( 2 ) ln \\u2061 ( 1 + r / 100 ) ≈ 72 r {\\\\displaystyle t={\\\\frac {\\\\ln(2)}{\\\\ln(1+r/100)}}\\\\approx {\\\\frac {72}{r}}} ,where t is the number of periods required. The formula above can be used for more than calculating the doubling time. If one wants to know the tripling time, for example, replace the constant 2 in the numerator with 3. As another example, if one wants to know the number of periods it takes for the initial value to rise by 50%, replace the constant 2 with 1.5. == Using the rule to estimate compounding periods == To estimate the number of periods required to double an original investment, divide the most convenient \"rule-quantity\" by the expected growth rate, expressed as a percentage. For instance, if you were to invest $100 with compounding interest at a rate of 9% per annum, the rule of 72 gives 72/9 = 8 years required for the investment to be worth $200; an exact calculation gives ln(2)/ln(1+0.09) = 8.0432 years.Similarly, to determine the time it takes for the value of money to halve at a given rate, divide the rule quantity by that rate. To determine the time for money\\'s buying power to halve, financiers divide the rule-quantity by the inflation rate. Thus at 3.5% inflation using the rule of 70, it should take approximately 70/3.5 = 20 years for the value of a unit of currency to halve. To estimate the impact of additional fees on financial policies (e.g., mutual fund fees and expenses, loading and expense charges on variable universal life insurance investment portfolios), divide 72 by the fee. For example, if the Universal Life policy charges an annual 3% fee over and above the cost of the underlying investment fund, then the total account value will be cut to 50% in 72 / 3 = 24 years, and then to 25% of the value in 48 years, compared to holding exactly the same investment outside the policy. == Choice of rule == The value 72 is a convenient choice of numerator, since it has many small divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, and 12. It provides a good approximation for annual compounding, and for compounding at typical rates (from 6% to 10%); the approximations are less accurate at higher interest rates. For continuous compounding, 69 gives accurate results for any rate, since ln(2) is about 69.3%; see derivation below. Since daily compounding is close enough to continuous compounding, for most purposes 69, 69.3 or 70 are better than 72 for daily compounding. For lower annual rates than those above, 69.3 would also be more accurate than 72. For higher annual rates, 78 is more accurate. Note: The most accurate value on each row is in italics, and the most accurate of the simpler rules in bold. == History == An early reference to the rule is in the Summa de arithmetica (Venice, 1494. Fol. 181, n. 44) of Luca Pacioli (1445–1514). He presents the rule in a discussion regarding the estimation of the doubling time of an investment, but does not derive or explain the rule, and it is thus assumed that the rule predates Pacioli by some time. A voler sapere ogni quantità a tanto per 100 l\\'anno, in quanti anni sarà tornata doppia tra utile e capitale, tieni per regola 72, a mente, il quale sempre partirai per l\\'interesse, e quello che ne viene, in tanti anni sarà raddoppiato. Esempio: Quando l\\'interesse è a 6 per 100 l\\'anno, dico che si parta 72 per 6; ne vien 12, e in 12 anni sarà raddoppiato il capitale. (emphasis added). Roughly translated: In wanting to know of any capital, at a given yearly percentage, in how many years it will double adding the interest to the capital, keep as a rule [the number] 72 in mind, which you will always divide by the interest, and what results, in that many years it will be doubled. Example: When the interest is 6 percent per year, I say that one divides 72 by 6; 12 results, and in 12 years the capital will be doubled. == Adjustments for higher accuracy == For higher rates, a larger numerator would be better (e.g., for 20%, using 76 to get 3.8 years would be only about 0.002 off, where using 72 to get 3.6 would be about 0.2 off). This is because, as above, the rule of 72 is only an approximation that is accurate for interest rates from 6% to 10%. For every three percentage points away from 8%, the value of 72 could be adjusted by 1: t ≈ 72 + ( r − 8 ) / 3 r {\\\\displaystyle t\\\\approx {\\\\frac {72+(r-8)/3}{r}}} or, for the same result: t ≈ 70 + ( r − 2 ) / 3 r {\\\\displaystyle t\\\\approx {\\\\frac {70+(r-2)/3}{r}}} Both of these equations simplify to: t ≈ 208 3 r + 1 3 {\\\\displaystyle t\\\\approx {\\\\frac {208}{3r}}+{\\\\frac {1}{3}}} Note that 208 3 {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\frac {208}{3}}} is quite close to 69.3. === E-M rule === The Eckart–McHale second-order rule (the E-M rule) provides a multiplicative correction for the rule of 69.3 that is very accurate for rates from 0% to 20%, whereas the rule is normally only accurate at the lowest end of interest rates, from 0% to about 5%. To compute the E-M approximation, multiply the rule of 69.3 result by 200/(200−r) as follows: t ≈ 69.3 r × 200 200 − r {\\\\displaystyle t\\\\approx {\\\\frac {69.3}{r}}\\\\times {\\\\frac {200}{200-r}}} .For example, if the interest rate is 18%, the rule of 69.3 gives t = 3.85 years, which the E-M rule multiplies by 200 182 {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\frac {200}{182}}} (i.e. 200/ (200−18)) to give a doubling time of 4.23 years. As the actual doubling time at this rate is 4.19 years, the E-M rule thus gives a closer approximation than the rule of 72. To obtain a similar correction for the rule of 70 or 72, one of the numerators can be set and the other adjusted to keep their product approximately the same. The E-M rule could thus be written also as t ≈ 70 r × 198 200 − r {\\\\displaystyle t\\\\approx {\\\\frac {70}{r}}\\\\times {\\\\frac {198}{200-r}}} or t ≈ 72 r × 192 200 − r {\\\\displaystyle t\\\\approx {\\\\frac {72}{r}}\\\\times {\\\\frac {192}{200-r}}} In these variants, the multiplicative correction becomes 1 respectively for r=2 and r=8, the values for which the rules of 70 and 72 are most accurate. === Padé approximant === The third-order Padé approximant gives a more accurate answer over an even larger range of r, but it has a slightly more complicated formula: t ≈ 69.3 r × 600 + 4 r 600 + r {\\\\displaystyle t\\\\approx {\\\\frac {69.3}{r}}\\\\times {\\\\frac {600+4r}{600+r}}} which simplifies to: t ≈ 207900 + 1386 r 3000 r + 5 r 2 {\\\\displaystyle t\\\\approx {\\\\frac {207900+1386r}{3000r+5r^{2}}}} == Derivation == === Periodic compounding === For periodic compounding, future value is given by: F V = P V ⋅ ( 1 + r ) t {\\\\displaystyle FV=PV\\\\cdot (1+r)^{t}} where P V {\\\\displaystyle PV} is the present value, t {\\\\displaystyle t} is the number of time periods, and r {\\\\displaystyle r} stands for the interest rate per time period. The future value is double the present value when: F V = P V ⋅ 2 {\\\\displaystyle FV=PV\\\\cdot 2} which is the following condition: ( 1 + r ) t = 2 {\\\\displaystyle (1+r)^{t}=2\\\\,} This equation is easily solved for t {\\\\displaystyle t} : ln \\u2061 ( ( 1 + r ) t ) = ln \\u2061 2 t ln \\u2061 ( 1 + r ) = ln \\u2061 2 t = ln \\u2061 2 ln \\u2061 ( 1 + r ) {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\begin{array}{ccc}\\\\ln((1+r)^{t})&=&\\\\ln 2\\\\\\\\t\\\\ln(1+r)&=&\\\\ln 2\\\\\\\\t&=&{\\\\frac {\\\\ln 2}{\\\\ln(1+r)}}\\\\end{array}}} A simple rearrangement shows: ln \\u2061 2 ln \\u2061 ( 1 + r ) = ( ln \\u2061 2 r ) ( r ln \\u2061 ( 1 + r ) ) {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\frac {\\\\ln {2}}{\\\\ln {(1+r)}}}={\\\\bigg (}{\\\\frac {\\\\ln 2}{r}}{\\\\bigg )}{\\\\bigg (}{\\\\frac {r}{\\\\ln(1+r)}}{\\\\bigg )}} If r is small, then ln(1 + r) approximately equals r (this is the first term in the Taylor series). That is, the latter factor grows slowly when r {\\\\displaystyle r} is close to zero. Call this latter factor f ( r ) = r ln \\u2061 ( 1 + r ) {\\\\displaystyle f(r)={\\\\frac {r}{\\\\ln(1+r)}}} . The function f ( r ) {\\\\displaystyle f(r)} is shown to be accurate in the approximation of t {\\\\displaystyle t} for a small, positive interest rate when r = .08 {\\\\displaystyle r=.08} (see derivation below). f ( .08 ) ≈ 1.03949 {\\\\displaystyle f(.08)\\\\approx 1.03949} , and we therefore approximate time t {\\\\displaystyle t} as: t = ( ln \\u2061 2 r ) f ( .08 ) ≈ .72 r {\\\\displaystyle t={\\\\bigg (}{\\\\frac {\\\\ln 2}{r}}{\\\\bigg )}f(.08)\\\\approx {\\\\frac {.72}{r}}} Written as a percentage: .72 r = 72 100 r {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\frac {.72}{r}}={\\\\frac {72}{100r}}} This approximation increases in accuracy as the compounding of interest becomes continuous (see derivation below). 100 r {\\\\displaystyle 100r} is r {\\\\displaystyle r} written as a percentage. In order to derive the more precise adjustments presented above, it is noted that ln \\u2061 ( 1 + r ) {\\\\displaystyle \\\\ln(1+r)\\\\,} is more closely approximated by r − r 2 2 {\\\\displaystyle r-{\\\\frac {r^{2}}{2}}} (using the second term in the Taylor series). 0.693 r − r 2 / 2 {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\frac {0.693}{r-r^{2}/2}}} can then be further simplified by Taylor approximations: 0.693 r − r 2 / 2 = 69.3 R − R 2 / 200 = 69.3 R 1 1 − R / 200 ≈ 69.3 ( 1 + R / 200 ) R = 69.3 R + 69.3 200 = 69.3 R + 0.3465 {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\begin{array}{ccc}{\\\\frac {0.693}{r-r^{2}/2}}&=&{\\\\frac {69.3}{R-R^{2}/200}}\\\\\\\\&&\\\\\\\\&=&{\\\\frac {69.3}{R}}{\\\\frac {1}{1-R/200}}\\\\\\\\&&\\\\\\\\&\\\\approx &{\\\\frac {69.3(1+R/200)}{R}}\\\\\\\\&&\\\\\\\\&=&{\\\\frac {69.3}{R}}+{\\\\frac {69.3}{200}}\\\\\\\\&&\\\\\\\\&=&{\\\\frac {69.3}{R}}+0.3465\\\\end{array}}} Replacing the \"R\" in R/200 on the third line with 7.79 gives 72 on the numerator. This shows that the rule of 72 is most accurate for periodically compounded interests around 8%. Similarly, replacing the \"R\" in R/200 on the third line with 2.02 gives 70 on the numerator, showing the rule of 70 is most accurate for periodically compounded interests around 2%. Alternatively, the E-M rule is obtained if the second-order Taylor approximation is used directly. === Continuous compounding === For continuous compounding, the derivation is simpler and yields a more accurate rule: ( e r ) p = 2 e r p = 2 ln \\u2061 e r p = ln \\u2061 2 r p = ln \\u2061 2 p = ln \\u2061 2 r p ≈ 0.693147 r {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\begin{array}{ccc}(e^{r})^{p}&=&2\\\\\\\\e^{rp}&=&2\\\\\\\\\\\\ln e^{rp}&=&\\\\ln 2\\\\\\\\rp&=&\\\\ln 2\\\\\\\\p&=&{\\\\frac {\\\\ln 2}{r}}\\\\\\\\&&\\\\\\\\p&\\\\approx &{\\\\frac {0.693147}{r}}\\\\end{array}}} == See also == Exponential growth Time value of money Interest Discount Rule of 16 Rule of three (statistics) == References == == External links == The Scales Of 70 – extends the rule of 72 beyond fixed-rate growth to variable rate compound growth including positive and negative rates.',\n",
              " 'Preservation Action is an American 501(c)4 non-profit historic preservation advocacy organization. Preservation Action was created in 1974 to serve as the national grassroots lobby for historic preservation. The organization seeks to make historic preservation a national priority by advocating to all branches of the federal government for sound preservation policy and programs through a grassroots constituency of hundreds of members from throughout the United States. Preservation Action provides information and training, and encourages direct contact with elected representatives, with National Historic Preservation Advocacy Week being the highlight of advocacy and outreach efforts each year.Preservation Action\\'s offices are in the Christian Heurich Mansion in Washington, D.C., though it has representatives across the country. == History == Preservation Action came about after the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966. Early in the 1970s, preservation leaders realized that achieving their goals required substantial increases in federal support. This included especially the need for appropriations for federal-state preservation programs, changes in laws and regulations, and an understanding of the U.S. Congress and the federal government of the benefits of historic preservation. Preservation Action proved instrumental in the passage of various laws and amendments, including the Tax Reform Act of 1976. Following the success of these early advocacy efforts, the focus shifted slightly to helping local organizations advocate for preservation in their own communities and states as well as continuing to lobby Congress for increased funding for federal preservation projects and agencies.The success of Preservation Action at the federal level, inspired the establishment of enhanced preservation lobbying efforts at the state level. Such was the case with the establishment of Connecticut Preservation Action in 1979, to overturn a newly enacted law that would have crippled the state\\'s National Register program.In the 1980s preservationists were increasingly interested in the \\'business\\' of preservation\\'. Initiatives like the Main Street Program, established by the National Trust for Historic Preservation in 1980, helped to focus efforts to improve historic downtown areas and commercial districts throughout the United States. Into this milieu came Preservation Action, that along with the National Trust for Historic Preservation, served as an important advocate for historic preservation at the federal level.With improved incentives for historic preservation in the form of tax credits and other programs, the focus of urban projects shifted dramatically from demolition to rehabilitation. Nellie Longsworth, founding member and President of Preservation Action for twenty-two years, explained: \"All kinds of things have been tried to stop the deterioration of downtowns. The first program that ever really worked was the investment tax credit.\" With the unprecedented growth in historic preservation activities, Preservation Action cemented its role as a rallying point for the private historic preservation community at the national level, along with the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Sources credit this coming together of forces in support of historic preservation, and Longsworth especially. Arthur P. Ziegler Jr., wrote \"Never before or since have we seen preservation activities carried out so diligently by so many with such excellent results.\"In more recent decades, federal programs such as Save America\\'s Treasures and Preserve America have brought resources to the front lines of where preservation work is being done in communities. These same programs, despite their effectiveness, were threatened by cutbacks in funding in the present fiscal environment. Preservation Action has always and continues to play an important role in advocating for these federal programs to support historic preservation at the state and local level. In 2015, Preservation Action started to conduct monthly calls with statewide organizations to better connect states to the legislative efforts happening at the federal level, as well as, connecting Preservation Action the legislative efforts happening at the state and local level.In 2016, prior to the November Congressional elections, Preservation Action conducted a Federal Candidate Historic Preservation Survey. Preservation Action conducted a nationwide historic preservation survey of all candidates running for the U.S House and U.S Senate. The survey gauged candidates on their support of a number of issues important to preservationists, like the Historic Preservation Fund and Federal Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit program. == Current activities == Preservation Action has several existing programs and activities to advance the cause of historic preservation today. A few of these follow. === Legislative Update === The Legislative Update is an email sent out regularly on a weekly basis to Preservation Action members. Updates on spending bills and legislation affecting preservation are included each week. Special announcements are made and upcoming events are highlighted. === National Historic Preservation Advocacy Week === This event, usually held in March of each year, provides an opportunity for representatives from participating states to come and lobby their members of Congress. The first day provides a general overview of major issues affecting preservation. The second day is filled with Capitol Hill visits. == Leadership == Former Congressman Russ Carnahan is President of Preservation Action. He is responsible for the leadership of the organization, and furthering the member-driven legislative agenda in Congress through direct lobbying and/or through an active membership and national partners. He is supported by a staff in the preparation of educational materials and weekly legislative updates. The Board of Directors plays an active role in the operation of Preservation Action. An executive Committee with a Chair, several Vice Chairs, Secretary, and Treasurer assists in managing the organization. == Membership == To fulfill its mission, and to protect our nation\\'s preservation program, Preservation Action relies on the support of preservation advocates across the country. Now more than ever, with threats not only to preservation funding but to preservation policy, Preservation Action provides a strong, unified, and educated voice. More information on how to join Preservation may be found at their website. == Notes == == External links == Preservation Action Preservation Action records at the University of Maryland Libraries National Trust for Historic Preservation National Conference of State Historic Preservation Officers Advisory Council on Historic Preservation America\\'s Great Outdoors Preserve America Partnership for Sustainable Communities National Alliance of Preservation Commissions',\n",
              " 'A fuel cell vehicle (FCV) or fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) is an electric vehicle that uses a fuel cell, sometimes in combination with a small battery or supercapacitor, to power its onboard electric motor. Fuel cells in vehicles generate electricity generally using oxygen from the air and compressed hydrogen. Most fuel cell vehicles are classified as zero-emissions vehicles that emit only water and heat. As compared with internal combustion vehicles, hydrogen vehicles centralize pollutants at the site of the hydrogen production, where hydrogen is typically derived from reformed natural gas. Transporting and storing hydrogen may also create pollutants. Fuel cells have been used in various kinds of vehicles including forklifts, especially in indoor applications where their clean emissions are important to air quality, and in space applications. Fuel cells are being developed and tested in trucks, buses, boats, ships, motorcycles and bicycles, among other kinds of vehicles. The first road vehicle powered by a fuel cell was the Chevrolet Electrovan, introduced by General Motors in 1966. The Toyota FCHV and Honda FCX, which began leasing on December 2, 2002, became the world\\'s first government-certified commercial fuel cell vehicles, and the Honda FCX Clarity, which began leasing in 2008, was the world\\'s first fuel cell vehicle designed for mass production rather than adapting an existing model. In 2013, Hyundai Motors began production of the Hyundai ix35 FCEV, claimed to be the world\\'s first mass-produced fuel cell electric vehicle, which was subsequently introduced to the market as a lease-only vehicle. In 2014, Toyota began selling the Toyota Mirai, the world\\'s first dedicated fuel cell vehicle.As of December 2020, 31,225 passenger FCEVs powered with hydrogen had been sold worldwide. As of 2021, there were only two models of fuel cell cars publicly available in select markets: the Toyota Mirai (2014-present) and the Hyundai Nexo (2018–present). The Honda Clarity was produced from 2016 to 2021, when it was discontinued. As of 2020, there was limited hydrogen infrastructure, with fewer than fifty hydrogen fueling stations for automobiles publicly available in the U.S. Critics doubt whether hydrogen will be efficient or cost-effective for automobiles, as compared with other zero emission technologies, and in 2019, The Motley Fool opined: \"What\\'s tough to dispute is that the hydrogen fuel cell dream is all but dead for the passenger vehicle market.\" == Description and purpose of fuel cells in vehicles == All fuel cells are made up of three parts: an electrolyte, an anode and a cathode. In principle, a hydrogen fuel cell functions like a battery, producing electricity, which can run an electric motor. Instead of requiring recharging, however, the fuel cell can be refilled with hydrogen. Different types of fuel cells include polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) Fuel Cells, direct methanol fuel cells, phosphoric acid fuel cells, molten carbonate fuel cells, solid oxide fuel cells, reformed methanol fuel cell and Regenerative Fuel Cells. == History == The concept of the fuel cell was first demonstrated by Humphry Davy in 1801, but the invention of the first working fuel cell is credited to William Grove, a chemist, lawyer, and physicist. Grove\\'s experiments with what he called a \"gas voltaic battery\" proved in 1842 that an electric current could be produced by an electrochemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen over a platinum catalyst. English engineer Francis Thomas Bacon expanded on Grove\\'s work, creating and demonstrating various alkaline fuel cells from 1939 to 1959.The first modern fuel cell vehicle was a modified Allis-Chalmers farm tractor, fitted with a 15 kilowatt fuel cell, around 1959. The Cold War Space Race drove further development of fuel cell technology. Project Gemini tested fuel cells to provide electrical power during crewed space missions. Fuel cell development continued with the Apollo Program. The electrical power systems in the Apollo capsules and lunar modules used alkali fuel cells. In 1966, General Motors developed the first fuel cell road vehicle, the Chevrolet Electrovan. It had a PEM fuel cell, a range of 120 miles and a top speed of 70 mph. There were only two seats, as the fuel cell stack and large tanks of hydrogen and oxygen took up the rear portion of the van. Only one was built, as the project was deemed cost-prohibitive.General Electric and others continued working on PEM fuel cells in the 1970s. Fuel cell stacks were still limited principally to space applications in the 1980s, including the Space Shuttle. However, the closure of the Apollo Program sent many industry experts to private companies. By the 1990s, automobile manufacturers were interested in fuel cell applications, and demonstration vehicles were readied. In 2001, the first 700 Bar (10000 PSI) hydrogen tanks were demonstrated, reducing the size of the fuel tanks that could be used in vehicles and extending the range. == Applications == There are fuel cell vehicles for all modes of transport. The most prevalent fuel cell vehicles are cars, buses, forklifts and material handling vehicles. === Automobiles === Honda established the world\\'s first fuel cell vehicle dealer network in 2008, and at the time was the only company able to lease hydrogen fuel cell vehicles to private customers. The Honda FCX Clarity was introduced in 2008 for leasing by customers in Japan and Southern California and discontinued by 2015. From 2008 to 2014, Honda leased a total of 45 FCX units in the US. Over 20 other FCEV prototypes and demonstration cars were released in that time period, including the GM HydroGen4, and Mercedes-Benz F-Cell. The Hyundai ix35 FCEV Fuel Cell vehicle was available for lease from 2014 to 2018, when 54 units were leased. In 2018, Hyundai introduced the Nexo.Sales of the Toyota Mirai to customers began in Japan in December 2014. Most of the initial customers were expected to be governments and corporations, not individuals. Pricing started at ¥6,700,000 (~US$57,400) before taxes and a government incentive of ¥2,000,000 (~US$19,600). Former European Parliament President Pat Cox estimated that Toyota initially would lose about $100,000 on each Mirai sold. As of December 2017, global sales totaled 5,300 Mirais. The top selling markets were the U.S. with 2,900 units, Japan with 2,100 and Europe with 200.In 2015, Toyota announced that it would offer all 5,680 patents related to hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and hydrogen fuel cell charging station technology, which it has been researching for over 20 years, to its competitors free of charge in order to stimulate the market for hydrogen-powered vehicles.The Honda Clarity Fuel Cell was produced from 2016 to 2021. The 2017 Clarity had the highest combined and city fuel economy ratings among all hydrogen fuel cell cars rated by the EPA that year, with a combined city/highway rating of 67 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (MPGe), and 68 MPGe in city driving. In 2019, Katsushi Inoue, the president of Honda Europe, stated, \"Our focus is on hybrid and electric vehicles now. Maybe hydrogen fuel cell cars will come, but that\\'s a technology for the next era.\"By 2017, Daimler phased out its FCEV development, citing declining battery costs and increasing range of EVs, and most of the automobile companies developing hydrogen cars had switched their focus to battery electric vehicles. By 2020, only three car makers were still manufacturing, or had active manufacturing programs for hydrogen cars. ==== Fuel economy ==== The following table compares EPA\\'s fuel economy expressed in miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (MPGe) for the two models of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles rated by the EPA as of September 2021, and available in California. === Fuel cells powered by an ethanol reformer === In June 2016, Nissan announced plans to develop fuel cell vehicles powered by ethanol rather than hydrogen. Nissan claims this technical approach would be cheaper, and that it would be easier to deploy the fueling infrastructure than a hydrogen infrastructure. The vehicle would include a tank holding a blend of water and ethanol, which is fed into an onboard reformer that splits it into hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The hydrogen is then fed into a solid oxide fuel cell. According to Nissan, the liquid fuel could be an ethanol-water blend at a 55:45 ratio. === Buses === As of 2020, 5,648 hydrogen fuel cell buses were in use around the world, with 93.7% of them in China.From the late 1980s, concern regarding diesel emissions from buses led to experimentation with fuel cells to power them. After initial experiments with phosphoric acid fuel cells, hydrogen-powered fuel-cell buses were tested in cities in the late 1990s. In the 2000s, buses entered trial service in cities around the world; the European Union supported the research project Clean Urban Transport for Europe.By the 2010s, commercial introduction of hydrogen fuel cell buses was underway around the world. However, many transit operators were purchasing battery electric buses instead, as these were cheaper to operate and purchase. However, battery electric buses lacked range compared to diesel buses, take time to charge (often overnight, comparied with hydrogen fuel cell buses, which can be refilled quickly) and have reduced energy storage in cold weather. Some companies have proposed using the fuel cell as a range extender, combining it with a larger battery or a supercapacitor.Hydrogen fuel cell buses have historically been significantly more expensive to purchase and operate than diesel, hybrid or electric buses. In recent years, costs have been reduced to levels comparable with diesel buses.A variety of bus manufacturers are currently producing hydrogen fuel cell buses. Bus manufacturers usually work with a provider of hydrogen fuel cells to power the bus, such as Ballard Power Systems or Toyota. === Forklifts === A fuel cell forklift (also called a fuel cell lift truck or a fuel cell forklift) is a fuel cell-powered industrial forklift truck used to lift and transport materials. Most fuel cells used in forklifts are powered by PEM fuel cells.In 2013, there were over 4,000 fuel cell forklifts used in material handling in the US from which only 500 received funding from DOE (2012). Fuel cell fleets are operated by a large number of companies, including Sysco Foods, FedEx Freight, GENCO (at Wegmans, Coca-Cola, Kimberly Clark, and Whole Foods), and H-E-B Grocers. Europe demonstrated 30 fuel cell forklifts with Hylift and extended it with HyLIFT-EUROPE to 200 units, with other projects in France and Austria. Pike Research stated in 2011 that fuel-cell-powered forklifts will be the largest driver of hydrogen fuel demand by 2020.PEM fuel-cell-powered forklifts provide significant benefits over petroleum powered forklifts as they produce no local emissions. Fuel-cell forklifts can work for a full 8-hour shift on a single tank of hydrogen, can be refueled in 3 minutes and have a lifetime of 8–10 years. Fuel cell-powered forklifts are often used in refrigerated warehouses as their performance is not degraded by lower temperatures. In design the FC units are often made as drop-in replacements. === Motorcycles and bicycles === In 2005, the British firm Intelligent Energy produced the first working hydrogen run motorcycle called the ENV (Emission Neutral Vehicle). It holds enough fuel to run for four hours, and to travel 160 km (100 mi) in an urban area, at a top speed of 80 km/h (50 mph). There are other examples of bikes and bicycles with a hydrogen fuel cell engine. The Suzuki Burgman received \"whole vehicle type\" approval in the EU. The PHB was a hydrogen bicycle with an electric motor. It debuted in Shanghai in 2008, but it was discontinued due to lack of hydrogen fuel services. Its predecessor was a hydrogen bicycle called Palcan, based in Vancouver, Canada. === Airplanes === Boeing researchers and industry partners throughout Europe conducted experimental flight tests in February 2008 of a crewed airplane powered only by a fuel cell and lightweight batteries. The Fuel Cell Demonstrator Airplane, as it was called, used a Proton-Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cell/lithium-ion battery hybrid system to power an electric motor, which was coupled to a conventional propeller. In 2003, the world\\'s first propeller driven airplane to be powered entirely by a fuel cell was flown. The fuel cell was a unique FlatStack stack design which allowed the fuel cell to be integrated with the aerodynamic surfaces of the plane.There have been several fuel cell powered unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). A Horizon fuel cell UAV set the record distance flown by a small UAV in 2007. The military is especially interested in this application because of the low noise, low thermal signature and ability to attain high altitude. In 2009, the Naval Research Laboratory\\'s (NRL\\'s) Ion Tiger utilized a hydrogen-powered fuel cell and flew for 23 hours and 17 minutes. Boeing is completing tests on the Phantom Eye, a high-altitude, long endurance (HALE) to be used to conduct research and surveillance flying at 20,000 m (65,000 ft) for up to four days at a time. Fuel cells are also being used to provide auxiliary power for aircraft, replacing fossil fuel generators that were previously used to start the engines and power on board electrical needs. Fuel cells can help airplanes reduce CO2 and other pollutant emissions and noise. === Boats === The world\\'s first Fuel Cell Boat HYDRA used an AFC system with 6.5 kW net output. For each liter of fuel consumed, the average outboard motor produces 140 times less the hydrocarbons produced by the average modern car. Fuel cell engines have higher energy efficiencies than combustion engines, and therefore offer better range and significantly reduced emissions. Amsterdam introduced its first fuel cell powered boat in 2011 that ferries people around the city\\'s canals. === Submarines === The first submersible application of fuel cells is the German Type 212 submarine. Each Type 212 contains nine PEM fuel cells, spread throughout the ship, providing between 30 kW and 50 kW each of electrical power. This allows the Type 212 to remain submerged longer and makes them more difficult to detect. Fuel cell powered submarines are also easier to design, manufacture, and maintain than nuclear-powered submarines. === Trains === In March 2015, China South Rail Corporation (CSR) demonstrated the world\\'s first hydrogen fuel cell-powered tramcar at an assembly facility in Qingdao. 83 miles of tracks for the new vehicle were built in seven Chinese cities. China had plans to spend 200 billion yuan ($32 billion) over the next five years to increase tram tracks to more than 1,200 miles.In 2016, Alstom debuted the Coradia iLint, a regional train powered by hydrogen fuel cells. It was designed to reach 140 kilometres per hour (87 mph) and travel 600–800 kilometres (370–500 mi) on a full tank of hydrogen. The train entered service in Germany in 2018 and is expected to be tested in the Netherlands beginning in 2019.Swiss manufacturer Stadler Rail signed a contract in California to supply a hydrogen fuel cell train in the US, the FLIRT H2 train, in 2024 as part of the Arrow rail project. === Trucks === For transport applications such as long-haul trucks, fuel cells are a potential solution for zero emission transport. A 2022 study in Energies magazine cites relatively fast refueling times compared with electric truck charging times and the current limitations of the energy density of batteries, but they note that \"operating constraints\" include the \"high amount of CO2 emissions [caused by] hydrogen production\", the lack of storage and refueling infrastructure, H2 leakage and safety challenges, efficiency \"losses in compression, storage and dispensing\", .In 2020, Hyundai started to manufacture hydrogen powered 34-ton cargo trucks under the model name XCIENT, making an initial shipment of 10 of the vehicles to Switzerland. They are able to travel 400 kilometres (250 mi) on a full tank and take 8 to 20 minutes to fill up.In 2022, Total Transportation Services (TTSI), Toyota Logistics Services (TLS), UPS, and Southern Counties Express (SCE) are operating a 12-month \"Shore-to-Store (S2S) project\" running hydrogen fuel cell trucks on trips from Los Angeles area ports. The Kenworth T680 hydrogen prototype used in Los Angeles and Long Beach was unveiled in 2018 and has also been tested in the Seattle area. == Hydrogen infrastructure == Eberle and Rittmar von Helmolt stated in 2010 that challenges remain before fuel cell cars can become competitive with other technologies and cite the lack of an extensive hydrogen infrastructure in the U.S.: As of July 2020, there were 43 publicly accessible hydrogen refueling stations in the US, 41 of which were located in California. In 2013, Governor Jerry Brown signed AB 8, a bill to fund $20 million a year for 10 years to build up to 100 stations. In 2014, the California Energy Commission funded $46.6 million to build 28 stations.Japan got its first commercial hydrogen fueling station in 2014. By March 2016, Japan had 80 hydrogen fueling stations, and the Japanese government aims to double this number to 160 by 2020. In May 2017, there were 91 hydrogen fueling stations in Japan. Germany had 18 public hydrogen fueling stations in July 2015. The German government hoped to increase this number to 50 by end of 2016, but only 30 were open in June 2017. == Codes and standards == Under United Nations global technical regulations for wheeled vehicles, specifically regarding hydrogen usage, there are international standards which define aspects of engineering and overall integrity, performance, safety, part lifecycle, and various other categories. One notable area of these regulations is regarding the compressed hydrogen storage systems that typically reach the end of qualified service life at 15 or fewer years in use. == US programs == In 2003, US President George Bush proposed the Hydrogen Fuel Initiative (HFI). The HFI aimed to further develop hydrogen fuel cells and infrastructure technologies to accelerate the commercial introduction of fuel cell vehicles. By 2008, the U.S. had contributed 1 billion dollars to this project. In 2009, Steven Chu, then the US Secretary of Energy, asserted that hydrogen vehicles \"will not be practical over the next 10 to 20 years\". In 2012, however, Chu stated that he saw fuel cell cars as more economically feasible as natural gas prices had fallen and hydrogen reforming technologies had improved. In June 2013, the California Energy Commission granted $18.7M for hydrogen fueling stations. In 2013, Governor Brown signed AB 8, a bill to fund $20 million a year for 10 years for up to 100 stations. In 2013, the US DOE announced up to $4 million planned for \"continued development of advanced hydrogen storage systems\". On May 13, 2013, the Energy Department launched H2USA, which is focused on advancing hydrogen infrastructure in the US. == Cost == By 2010, advancements in fuel cell technology had reduced the size, weight and cost of fuel cell electric vehicles. In 2010, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) estimated that the cost of automobile fuel cells had fallen 80% since 2002 and that such fuel cells could potentially be manufactured for $51/kW, assuming high-volume manufacturing cost savings. Fuel cell electric vehicles have been produced with \"a driving range of more than 250 miles between refueling\". They can be refueled in less than 5 minutes. Deployed fuel cell buses have a 40% higher fuel economy than diesel buses. EERE\\'s Fuel Cell Technologies Program claims that, as of 2011, fuel cells achieved a 42 to 53% fuel cell electric vehicle efficiency at full power, and a durability of over 75,000 miles with less than 10% voltage degradation, double that achieved in 2006. In 2012, Lux Research, Inc. issued a report that concluded that \"Capital cost ... will limit adoption to a mere 5.9 GW\" by 2030, providing \"a nearly insurmountable barrier to adoption, except in niche applications\". Lux\\'s analysis concluded that by 2030, PEM stationary fuel cell applications will reach $1 billion, while the vehicle market, including fuel cell forklifts, will reach a total of $2 billion. == Environmental impact == The environmental impact of fuel cell vehicles depends on the primary energy with which the hydrogen was produced. Fuel cell vehicles are only environmentally benign when the hydrogen was produced with renewable energy. If this is the case fuel cell cars are cleaner and more efficient than fossil fuel cars. However, they are not as efficient as battery electric vehicles which consume much less energy. Usually a fuel cell car consumes 2.4 times more energy than a battery electric car, because electrolysis and storage of hydrogen is much less efficient than using electricity to directly load a battery.As of 2009, motor vehicles used most of the petroleum consumed in the U.S. and produced over 60% of the carbon monoxide emissions and about 20% of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, however production of hydrogen for hydro cracking used in gasoline production chief amongst its industrial uses was responsible for approximately 10% of fleet wide greenhouse gas emissions. In contrast, a vehicle fueled with pure hydrogen emits few pollutants, producing mainly water and heat, although the production of the hydrogen would create pollutants unless the hydrogen used in the fuel cell were produced using only renewable energy.In a 2005 well-to-wheels analysis, the DOE estimated that fuel cell electric vehicles using hydrogen produced from natural gas would result in emissions of approximately 55% of the CO2 per mile of internal combustion engine vehicles and have approximately 25% less emissions than hybrid vehicles. In 2006, Ulf Bossel stated that the large amount of energy required to isolate hydrogen from natural compounds (water, natural gas, biomass), package the light gas by compression or liquefaction, transfer the energy carrier to the user, plus the energy lost when it is converted to useful electricity with fuel cells, leaves around 25% for practical use.\" Richard Gilbert, co-author of Transport Revolutions: Moving People and Freight without Oil (2010), comments similarly, that producing hydrogen gas ends up using some of the energy it creates. Then, energy is taken up by converting the hydrogen back into electricity within fuel cells. \"\\'This means that only a quarter of the initially available energy reaches the electric motor\\' ... Such losses in conversion don\\'t stack up well against, for instance, recharging an electric vehicle (EV) like the Nissan Leaf or Chevy Volt from a wall socket\". A 2010 well-to-wheels analysis of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles report from Argonne National Laboratory states that renewable H2 pathways offer much larger green house gas benefits. This result has recently been confirmed. In 2010, a US DOE well-to-wheels publication assumed that the efficiency of the single step of compressing hydrogen to 6,250 psi (43.1 MPa) at the refueling station is 94%. A 2016 study in the November issue of the journal Energy by scientists at Stanford University and the Technical University of Munich concluded that, even assuming local hydrogen production, \"investing in all-electric battery vehicles is a more economical choice for reducing carbon dioxide emissions, primarily due to their lower cost and significantly higher energy efficiency.\" == Criticism of fuel cell cars == In 2008, professor Jeremy P. Meyers, in the Electrochemical Society journal Interface wrote that fuel cells \"are not as efficient as batteries, due primarily to the inefficiency of the oxygen reduction reaction. ... [T]hey make the most sense for operation disconnected from the grid, or when fuel can be provided continuously. For applications that require frequent and relatively rapid start-ups ... where zero emissions are a requirement, as in enclosed spaces such as warehouses.\" Also in 2008, Wired News reported that \"experts say it will be 40 years or more before hydrogen has any meaningful impact on gasoline consumption or global warming, and we can\\'t afford to wait that long. In the meantime, fuel cells are diverting resources from more immediate solutions.\" In 2008, Robert Zubrin, the author of Energy Victory, said: \"Hydrogen is \\'just about the worst possible vehicle fuel\\'\". If hydrogen could be produced using renewable energy, \"it would surely be easier simply to use this energy to charge the batteries of all-electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles.\" The Los Angeles Times wrote in 2009, \"Any way you look at it, hydrogen is a lousy way to move cars.\" The Washington Post asked in November 2009, \"[W]hy would you want to store energy in the form of hydrogen and then use that hydrogen to produce electricity for a motor, when electrical energy is already waiting to be sucked out of sockets all over America and stored in auto batteries...?\"The Motley Fool stated in 2013 that \"there are still cost-prohibitive obstacles [for hydrogen cars] relating to transportation, storage, and, most importantly, production.\" Volkswagen\\'s Rudolf Krebs said in 2013 that \"no matter how excellent you make the cars themselves, the laws of physics hinder their overall efficiency. The most efficient way to convert energy to mobility is electricity.\" He elaborated: \"Hydrogen mobility only makes sense if you use green energy\", but ... you need to convert it first into hydrogen \"with low efficiencies\" where \"you lose about 40 percent of the initial energy\". You then must compress the hydrogen and store it under high pressure in tanks, which uses more energy. \"And then you have to convert the hydrogen back to electricity in a fuel cell with another efficiency loss\". Krebs continued: \"in the end, from your original 100 percent of electric energy, you end up with 30 to 40 percent.\"In 2014, electric automotive and energy futurist Julian Cox wrote that producing hydrogen from methane \"is significantly more carbon intensive per unit of energy than coal. Mistaking fossil hydrogen from the hydraulic fracturing of shales for an environmentally sustainable energy pathway threatens to encourage energy policies that will dilute and potentially derail global efforts to head-off climate change due to the risk of diverting investment and focus from vehicle technologies that are economically compatible with renewable energy.\" In 2014, former Dept. of Energy official Joseph Romm concluded that renewable energy cannot economically be used to make hydrogen for an FCV fleet \"either now or in the future.\" GreenTech Media\\'s analyst reached similar conclusions in 2014. In 2015, Clean Technica listed some of the disadvantages of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.A 2017 analysis published in Green Car Reports found that the best hydrogen fuel cell vehicles consume \"more than three times more electricity per mile than an electric vehicle ... generate more greenhouse-gas emissions than other powertrain technologies ... [and have] very high fuel costs. ... Considering all the obstacles and requirements for new infrastructure (estimated to cost as much as $400 billion), fuel-cell vehicles seem likely to be a niche technology at best, with little impact on U.S. oil consumption. In 2017, Michael Barnard, writing in Forbes, listed the continuing disadvantages of hydrogen fuel cell cars and concluded that \"by about 2008, it was very clear that hydrogen was and would be inferior to battery technology as a storage of energy for vehicles. [B]y 2025 the last hold outs should likely be retiring their fuel cell dreams.” A 2019 video by Real Engineering noted that using hydrogen as a fuel for cars does not help to reduce carbon emissions from transportation. The 95% of hydrogen still produced from fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide, and producing hydrogen from water is an energy-consuming process. Storing hydrogen requires more energy either to cool it down to the liquid state or to put it into tanks under high pressure, and delivering the hydrogen to fueling stations requires more energy and may release more carbon. The hydrogen needed to move a FCV a kilometer costs approximately eight times as much as the electricity needed to move a BEV the same distance. Also in 2019, Katsushi Inoue, the president of Honda Europe, stated, \"Our focus is on hybrid and electric vehicles now. Maybe hydrogen fuel cell cars will come, but that\\'s a technology for the next era.\"Assessments since 2020 have concluded that hydrogen vehicles are still only 38% efficient, while battery EVs from 80% to 95% efficient. A 2021 assessment by CleanTechnica concluded that while hydrogen cars are far less efficient than electric cars, the vast majority of hydrogen being produced is polluting grey hydrogen, and delivering hydrogen would require building a vast and expensive new infrastructure, the remaining two \"advantages of fuel cell vehicles – longer range and fast fueling times – are rapidly being eroded by improving battery and charging technology.\" A 2022 study in Nature Electronics agreed. == Innovation == Fuel cell patent fillings in the area of hydrogen fuel cells increased in the 1960s, partly due to NASAs space program; another increase in the 80s was driven by research for automobiles. This was followed by a surge in filings from 2000 to 2005 by inventors in Japan, US and South Korea. Since then, China has dominated patent fillings in the field, with a smaller number in Japan, Germany, South Korea and the US. Between 2016 and 2020, annual filings, particularly for transportation applications, increased by a further 23%.Almost 80% of the patents in the area of fuel cells for transportation were filed by car companies. Academia is collaborating actively with the industry. Although filings related to road vehicles such as cars and trucks dominate, inventions in other areas like shipping, aviation, rail and other special vehicles is increasing. Airbus, a major aircraft manufacturer, has increased its patenting activity in the area since 2019. The number of fuel cell patents for shipping applications is comparable in size to the one for aviation and similarly slow in growth.A World Intellectual Property Organization report argues that because heavy-duty vehicles, such as construction vehicles, forklifts, and airport tugs require a higher payload, the high energy density of hydrogen can make fuel cells a more advantageous solution than battery applications. == See also == Hydrogen vehicle Glossary of fuel cell terms Proton-exchange membrane fuel cell Reformed methanol fuel cell Fuel cell auxiliary power unit Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Energy Association Water-fuelled car == Notes == == External links == Heetebrij, Jan. \"A vision on a sustainable electric society supported by Electric Vehicles\", Olino Renewable Energy, June 5, 2009 Ulrich Hottelet: State funding for hybrid dreams, The Asia Pacific Times, October 2009 Fuel cell market size per Prescient & Strategic Market Research 2021',\n",

              " 'Birley Old Hall is a small English country house situated in the Birley Edge area of the City of Sheffield, England. The hall stands in an exposed situation at almost 200 metres above sea level on Edge Lane, some six km NW of the city centre and has been designated a Grade II listed building by English Heritage as has the Falconry which stands in the garden. == History == The hall was constructed in two phases, the easterly facing wing was constructed in the Late Middle Ages when it was known as “Byrlay Edge”, it was built with an oak cruck frame with an exterior of squared stone. Part of the cruck frame can be seen on the Edge Lane side of the original wing. In 1705 J. Carr added a new and more impressive south facing wing at right angles to the original. The 1705 extension has been described as having “restrained elegance” and included the construction of a gazebo in the garden, called the Falconry. The hall underwent some alterations and additions during the late 18th and mid 19th centuries, including a two-storey addition to the original wing. The hall was used briefly as a Youth Hostel in the 1940s and was purchased by Sheffield City Council after World War II. In 1959 the council leased the building to the steel manufacturers Daniel Doncaster and Sons as offices and the hall was extensively restored. The hall and Birley Edge lost much of its rural isolation in the 1960s when the Fox Hill council housing estate was constructed on land to the immediate south. The hall returned to use as a private dwelling in the early 1980s and once more was totally restored during its conversion back to residential use. The interior of the house has features such as large fireplaces dating from the 1600s, along with exposed original stone work in one of the lounges and larger bedrooms. == Architecture == The hall is constructed from locally quarried squared stone and is L shaped, the 1705 building has a coped date stone above the main door with the inscriptionS “JC 1705” and “DD 1959”. The roofs are gabled and hipped. The building has a mixture of mullioned, sash and casement windows. == References ==',\n",

              " 'In feudal Japan, individual military and citizens groups were primarily responsible for self-defense until the unification of Japan by Tokugawa Ieyasu in 1603. During the Edo period (1603–1868), the Tokugawa shogunate formed a centralized feudal government. Samurai warriors who once protected Japan from foreign enemies and fought each other for supremacy became the new police and internal security force. Their new job would be to ensure civil peace, which they accomplished for over 250 years. == History == During the Edo period the authoritarian Tokugawa shogunate instituted an elaborate police/security state, an administrative hierarchy was developed, and rules and regulations controlling many aspects of life in Japan went into effect. This new system of government has been called a police state, possibly the world\\'s first.In 1868 the samurai era ended with the overthrow of the Tokugawa shogunate and a new government came into power (Meiji government) and the samurai class was eventually abolished. In 1872, a former samurai, Kawaji Toshiyoshi, was sent to Europe to study systems of policing and he recommended a restructuring based partially on French and Prussian systems. In 1874, a nationalized police force was created using European police systems as a model. This new police force was the start of the modern police system in Japan, though it was initially dominated by former samurai from Satsuma who were part of the driving force behind the removal of the Tokugawa shogunate. The new Meiji period police continued the Edo period method of Japanese police controlling societal behavior and internal security as well as preventing and solving crimes. == Organization == The Edo period police apparatus utilized a multi-layered bureaucracy which employed the services of a wide variety of Japanese citizens. High and low ranking samurai, former criminals, private citizens and even citizen groups (Gonin Gumi) participated in keeping the peace and enforcing the laws and regulations of the Tokugawa shogunate. === Samurai police === Machi-bugyōDuring the Edo period, high ranking samurai with an allegiance to the Tokugawa shogunate (hatamoto) were appointed machi-bugyō (city administrators or commissioners). The machi-bugyō performed the roles of chief of police, prosecutor, judge and other judicial related business both criminal and civil in Edo and other major towns. YorikiWorking under the machi-bugyō was the yoriki. Yoriki were samurai—they managed patrols and guard units composed of lower ranking police officials. Yoriki, being of a higher class, were able to ride a horse while performing their duties and were trusted to carry out assignments of high importance. DōshinWorking under the yoriki was the dōshin. Dōshin were samurai but of a lower class than yoriki—they performed the duties of prison guard and patrol officer which required close contact with commoners (chonin). They investigated crimes such as murder and helped with executions. === Non-samurai police assistants === Edo period police relied heavily on commoners for assistance, from average village dwellers to the outcast hinin and eda castes. Members of the Japanese outcast were particularly helpful with guarding and executing prisoners, and disposing the bodies, something that samurai found to be repugnant (distasteful). KomonoKomono were non-samurai chōnin who went with the dōshin on patrols and provided assistance. OkappikiOkappiki were non-samurai from the lowest outcast class, often former criminals who worked for the dōshin as informers and spies. Gōyokiki/meakashiGōyokiki or meakashi were a non-samurai chōnin or outcast class who were hired by local residents and merchants to work as police assistants in a particular neighborhood—they were often former criminals. The term \"tesaki\" was used to describe gōyokiki or meakashi later in the Edo period. == Duties == Investigating crimes, arresting and interrogating arrested suspects, torturing criminal suspects in order to obtain a confession, punishing convicted criminals including executions. == Equipment == Edo period police used a variety of armor and carried lethal and non-lethal weapons to capture criminal suspects. If possible, suspected criminals were taken alive. This meant that special weapons and tactics had to be created in order to accomplish this task. === Weapons === Bansho rokugin or keigo roku-go: Edo period police stations were required to keep six kinds of weapons (bansho rokugin or keigo roku-go) available for use in case of disturbances. these were the kanamuchi, the kiriko no bo, the tetto, the sodegarami, the tsukubo, and the sasumata. Three of these tools were called torimono sandōgu (\"three tools of arresting\"), which consisted of the sodegarami, sasumata, and tsukubō. They were symbols of office and were often displayed in front of police checkpoints or used in processions, especially while convicted prisoners were being led to their execution. Sodegarami Sasumata Tsukubo Kanamuchi Kiriko no bo Tetto Metsubushi Jitte: an iron or wooden club or truncheon, the jitte was a non-lethal weapon and an official symbol of office. Te yari (hand spear): a small version of the yari suitable for use in confined spaces. Kusari fundo/manriki == Weapons == == Armour == Edo period police and assistants wore chain armour clothing, armour for the hands, and armour for the head. == See also == Criminal punishment in Edo-period Japan Jitte Law enforcement in Japan Shinsengumi Torimono sandōgu == Citations == == General references == Ames, Walter L.

              " 'Fulke Greville, 1st Baron Brooke, de jure 13th Baron Latimer and 5th Baron Willoughby de Broke KB PC (; 3 October 1554 – 30 September 1628), known before 1621 as Sir Fulke Greville, was an Elizabethan poet, dramatist, and statesman who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1581 and 1621, when he was raised to the peerage. Greville was a capable administrator who served the English Crown under Elizabeth I and James I as, successively, treasurer of the navy, chancellor of the exchequer, and commissioner of the Treasury, and who for his services was in 1621 made Baron Brooke, peer of the realm. Greville was granted Warwick Castle in 1604, making numerous improvements. Greville is best known today as the biographer of Sir Philip Sidney, and for his sober poetry, which presents dark, thoughtful and distinctly Calvinist views on art, literature, beauty and other philosophical matters. == Life == Fulke Greville, born 3 October 1554, at Beauchamp Court, near Alcester, Warwickshire, was the only son of Sir Fulke Greville (1536–1606) and Anne Neville (d. 1583), the daughter of Ralph Neville, 4th Earl of Westmorland. He was the grandson of Sir Fulke Greville (d. 10 November 1559) and Elizabeth Willoughby (buried 15 November 1562), eldest daughter of Robert Willoughby, 2nd Baron Willoughby de Broke, the only other child of the marriage was a daughter, Margaret Greville (1561–1631/2), who married Sir Richard Verney.He was sent in 1564, on the same day as his lifelong friend, Philip Sidney, to Shrewsbury School. He then went up to Jesus College, Cambridge in 1568.Sir Henry Sidney, Philip\\'s father, and president of the Council of Wales and the Marches, gave Greville in 1576 a post connected with the court of the Welsh Marches, but Greville resigned it in 1577 to go to attend the court of Queen Elizabeth I along with Philip Sidney. There, Greville became a great favourite with the Queen, who valued his sober character and administrative skills. In 1581, he was elected in a by-election as Member of Parliament for Southampton. Queen Elizabeth made him secretary to the principality of Wales in 1583. However, he was put out of favour more than once for leaving the country against her wishes. In 1581 at a Whitehall tournament in honour of French ambassadors Greville, Philip Sidney, Philip Howard Earl of Arundel and Frederick Lord Windsor staged an entertainment as the \"Four Foster Children of Desire\". The ambassadors were working on plans for Elizabeth\\'s marriage to Francis, Duke of Anjou. The \"Foster Children\" laid siege to the \"Fortress of Perfect Beautie\". After two days of challenges the Children admitted defeat. The entertainment was understood to convey the idea that Elizabeth was unattainable, devised by the opposition to the French marriage.Greville, Philip Sidney and Sir Edward Dyer were members of the \"Areopagus\", the literary clique which, under the leadership of Gabriel Harvey, supported the introduction of classical metres into English verse. Sidney and Greville arranged to sail with Sir Francis Drake in 1585 in his expedition against the Spanish West Indies, but Elizabeth forbade Drake to take them with him, and also refused Greville\\'s request to be allowed to join Robert Dudley\\'s army in the Netherlands. Philip Sidney, who took part in the campaign, was killed on 17 October 1586. Greville memorialized his beloved friend in A Dedication to Sir Philip Sidney. Greville participated in the Battle of Coutras in 1587. About 1591 Greville served further for a short time in Normandy under King Henry III of Navarre in the French Wars of Religion. This was his last experience of war. Greville represented Warwickshire in parliament in 1592–1593, 1597, 1601 and 1621. In 1598 he was made Treasurer of the Navy, and he retained the office through the early years of the reign of James I. Greville was granted Warwick Castle—situated on a bend of the River Avon in Warwickshire—by King James I in 1604. The castle was in a dilapidated condition when he took possession of it, and he spent £20,000 to restore it.In 1614 he became chancellor and under-treasurer of the exchequer, and throughout the reign, he was a valued supporter of James I, although in 1615 he advocated the summoning of Parliament. In 1618 he became commissioner of the treasury, and in 1621 he was raised to the peerage with the title of Baron Brooke, a title which had belonged to the family of his paternal grandmother. == Death and legacy == In 1628 Greville was stabbed at his house in Holborn, London by Ralph Haywood, a servant who believed that he had been cheated by being left out of his master\\'s will. Haywood then turned the knife on himself. Greville\\'s physicians treated his wounds by filling them with pig fat. Rather than disinfecting them, the pig fat turned rancid and infected the wounds, and he died in agony four weeks after the attack. His body was brought back to Warwick, and he was buried in the Collegiate Church of St Mary, Warwick, and on his tomb was inscribed the epitaph he had composed: Greville has numerous streets named after him in the Hatton Garden area of Holborn, London (see Hatton Garden#Street names etymologies). A line from Chorus Sacerdotum from Mustapha is quoted by Christopher Hitchens in his book Letters to a Young Contrarian.In 2018 the first-ever festival dedicated to Greville was launched in his home town, Alcester, Warwickshire. == Works == Greville is best known for his biography of Sidney (composed c. 1610–12), which circulated in manuscript with the title A Dedication to Sir Philip Sidney. It was published in 1652 as The Life of the Renowned Sir Philip Sidney. He includes some autobiographical matter in what amounts to a treatise on government. Greville\\'s poetry consists of closet tragedies, sonnets, and poems on political and moral subjects. His style is grave and sententious. Greville\\'s works include: BiographyA Dedication to Sir Philip SidneyCloset dramaAlaham MustaphaVerse poemsCaelica in CX Sonnets Of Monarchy A Treatise of Religion A Treatie of Humane Learning An Inquisition upon Fame and Honour A Treatie of WarresMiscellaneous prosea letter to an \"Honourable Lady\", a letter to Grevill Varney in France, a short speech delivered on behalf of Francis Bacon === Editions === Greville\\'s works were collected and reprinted by Alexander Balloch Grosart, in 1870, in four volumes. Poetry and Drama of Fulke Greville, edited by Geoffrey Bullough, was published in 1938. The Prose Works of Fulke Greville, edited by John Gouws, were published in 1986. The Selected Poems of Fulke Greville edited by Thom Gunn, with an afterword by Bradin Cormack, was published in 2009 (University of Chicago Press, ISBN 978-0-226-30846-3.) The Tragedy of Mustapha (London: Printed by J. Windet for N. Butter, 1609). Certaine Learned and Elegant Workes (London: Printed by E. Purslowe for H. Seyle, 1633) comprises A Treatise of Humane Learning, An Inquisition upon Fame and Honour, A Treatise of Wars, Alaham, Mustapha, Caelica, A Letter to an Honorable Lady, and A Letter of Travel. The Remains of Sir Fvlk Grevill Lord Brooke: Being Poems of Monarchy and Religion: Never Before Printed (London: Printed by T. N. for H. Herringman, 1670) comprises A Treatise of Monarchy and A Treatise of Religion. Poems and Dramas of Fulke Greville, First Lord Brooke, 2 volumes, edited by Geoffrey Bullough (Edinburgh: Oliver & Boyd, 1939; New York: Oxford University Press, 1945) comprises Caelica, A Treatise of Humane Learning, An Inquisition upon Fame and Honor, A Treatise of Wars, Mustapha, and Alaham. The Remains: Being Poems of Monarchy and Religion, edited by G. A. Wilkes (London: Oxford University Press, 1965) comprises A Treatise of Monarchy and A Treatise of Religion. The Prose Works Fulke Greville, Lord Brooke, edited by John Guows (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997), published as part of the Oxford English Texts series. A scholarly edition of his prose works, with an authoritative text, together with an introduction, commentary notes, and scholarly apparatus.The principal repository for Fulke Greville\\'s papers is the British Library (Add MSS 54566-54571, the Warwick Manuscripts; letters in the as-yet uncatalogued Earl Cowper mss.). Individual manuscripts of the Dedication to Sir Philip Sidney are to be found at the Bodleian Library, Oxford (a manuscript formerly owned by Dr. B. E. Juel-Jensen); Trinity College, Cambridge (MSS R.7.32 and 33); and the Shrewsbury Library (MS 295). == Critical reception == Charles Lamb commented on Greville: \"He is nine parts Machiavel and Tacitus, for one of Sophocles and Seneca... Whether we look into his plays or his most passionate love-poems, we shall find all frozen and made rigid with intellect.\" He goes on to speak of the obscurity of expression that runs through all of Greville\\'s poetry. Andrea McCrea sees the influence of Justus Lipsius in the Letter to an Honourable Lady, but elsewhere detects a scepticism more akin to Michel de Montaigne.A rhyming elegy on Greville, published in Henry Huth\\'s Inedited Poetical Miscellanies, brings charges of miserliness against him. Robert Pinsky has asserted that this work is comparable in force of imagination to John Donne. == Family == Lord Brooke, who never married, left no natural heirs, and his senior (Brooke) barony passed to his cousin and adopted son, Robert Greville (1608–1643), who took the side of Parliament in the English Civil War, and defeated the Royalists in a skirmish at Kineton in August 1642. Robert was killed during the siege of Lichfield on 2 March 1643, having survived the elder Greville by only fifteen years. His other barony (Willoughby de Broke) was inherited by his sister Margaret who married Sir Richard Verney. == See also == Canons of Elizabethan poetry List of owners of Warwick Castle == Notes == == References == == Sources == == Further reading == The Prose Works of Fulke Greville, Lord Brooke, edited by John Gouws (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1986) Paula Bennet, \"Recent Studies in Greville,\" English Literary Renaissance, 2 (Winter 1972): 376–382.

              " 'Taxiing (rarely spelled taxying) is the movement of an aircraft on the ground, under its own power, in contrast to towing or pushback where the aircraft is moved by a tug. The aircraft usually moves on wheels, but the term also includes aircraft with skis or floats (for water-based travel). An airplane uses taxiways to taxi from one place on an airport to another; for example, when moving from a hangar to the runway. The term \"taxiing\" is not used for the accelerating run along a runway prior to takeoff, or the decelerating run immediately after landing, which are called the takeoff roll and landing rollout, respectively. == Etymology == As early as 1909 aviation journalists envisioned aeroplanes to replace the taxicab in traffic-congested cities.Some aviators and some linguists report that around the year 1911 the slang word \"taxi\" was in use for an \"airplane\". They suggest that the way aircraft move under power before they take off or after they land reminded someone of the way taxicabs slowly drove around the block when looking for passengers.Also by 1909, French aviation pioneers like Blériot, Farman and Voisin used the term \"taxi\" for a trainer aircraft, that was so constructed that a pupil would not accidentally get airborne.Usage of the word for an airplane quickly disappeared again, but the verb \"to taxi\" stuck, and words like the \"taxiway\" were derived from it. == Propulsion == The thrust to propel the aircraft forward comes from its propellers or jet engines. Reverse thrust for backing up can be generated by thrust reversers such as on the Boeing C-17 Globemaster III, or reversible pitch propellers such as on the Lockheed C-130 Hercules, a procedure known as powerback. Most aircraft, however, are not designed to back up on their own and must be pushed back either by hand or by using an aircraft tug. At low power settings, combustion aircraft engines operate at lower efficiency than at cruise power settings. A typical A320 spends an average of 3.5 hours a day taxiing, using 600 liters (160 U.S. gal) of fuel. Hybrid electrically driven nose gear are under development to allow high use aircraft to shut down the engines during taxi operations. == Control == Steering is achieved by turning a nose wheel or tail wheel/rudder; the pilot controls the direction travelled with their feet. Larger jet aircraft have a tiller wheel on the left side of the cockpit that acts as a steering wheel allowing the nosewheel to be turned hydraulically. Braking is controlled by differential toe or heel brakes. Not all aircraft have steerable wheels, and in some cases steering is solely by means of differential braking (all Van\\'s aircraft for instance) or solely by means of the rudder (including all floatplanes). == Hover taxi == Skid-equipped helicopters and other VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) aircraft conduct hover taxiing to move in ground effect in the same manner that wheel-equipped aircraft ground taxi. In general hover taxis are conducted at speeds up to 20 kn (37 km/h; 23 mph), or below translational lift.The Bell CH-135 Twin Huey is hover taxied in a manner typical for skid-equipped aircraft of that size: This sequence is initiated from a stabilized 5 ft hover. Move the aircraft forward over the ground at a brisk walking pace. Maintain a constant height above ground, constant forward speed and ensure that the skids remain parallel to the direction of movement. Anticipate stopping so that large rearward cyclic applications are not required as this may result in the tail skids striking the ground. You are often required to taxi out of wind; be aware that when taxiing downwind in strong wind conditions there may be insufficient rearward cyclic to ensure adequate control and that the tail will be nearer the ground. Taxiing downwind is limited to 30 kts. == Safety == When taxiing, aircraft travel slowly. This ensures that they can be stopped quickly and do not risk wheel damage on larger aircraft if they accidentally turn off the paved surface. Taxi speeds are typically 16 to 19 kn (30 to 35 km/h; 18 to 22 mph).Rotor downwash limits helicopter hover-taxiing near parked light aircraft. The use of engine thrust near terminals is restricted due to the possibility of structural damage or injury to personnel caused by jet blast. == References == == External links == Media related to Taxiways at Wikimedia Commonsaircraft Media related to Taxiing in aviation at Wikimedia Commons',\n",

She is most famous for bringing Margaret Mitchell\\'s novel Gone with the Wind to the attention of David O. Selznick, for whom she worked, in 1936. She had a long career as representative, talent scout and agent with Leland Hayward, MCA and International Creative Management (\"ICM\"). == Career == Brown was born into New York high society as the daughter of Kate Ross and Henry Collins Brown, a founder of the Museum of the City of New York. In later years, her Hollywood friends were amused by the fact that she was listed in the New York Social Register.In 1924, she graduated from Wellesley College with a B.A. in English and an interest in drama. After graduation, she went to work for the Mary Arden Theater School in Peterborough, New Hampshire, which was owned by Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. and Boston lawyer Guy Currier. In 1926, Kennedy and Currier acquired the movie studio Film Booking Offices of America and offered Brown a job in New York reading and acquiring literary properties for the company, with the title \"Eastern Story Editor\". She stayed with the company, renamed RKO in 1928 after its acquisition by Radio Corporation of America, and achieved her first major success by acquiring Edna Ferber\\'s novel Cimarron. which was being sought by many movie companies, for a then-record $125,000. The movie of the book won the 1931 Academy Award for Best Picture.Later in 1931, David O. Selznick took over RKO. Selznick left RKO in 1933 to return to MGM, but in 1935 he found a financial backer, John Hay Whitney, who allowed him to set up his own studio, Selznick International Pictures. One of his first hires was Brown, still in the role of Eastern Story Editor, but later as \"Eastern Representative\" as Selznick expanded her role at the studio to that of his primary assistant. In addition to Gone with the Wind, she brought Daphne du Maurier\\'s Rebecca to the attention of Selznick. She also persuaded Ingrid Bergman to leave Stockholm for Hollywood for the Selznick production Intermezzo: A Love Story; signed Laurence Olivier to his first American contract for Rebecca, and convinced Alfred Hitchcock to sign a seven-year contract with Selznick International so that he could direct Rebecca. She also acquired the rights to Rose Franken\\'s Claudia: The Story of a Marriage in 1939 and was involved in the screen tests for that story that led to Phylis Walker (later renamed Jennifer Jones by Brown and Selznick) being signed by the studio.For tax reasons, Selznick International Pictures was liquidated in 1942, and the \"tall, elegant and formidable\" Brown, following the example of Selznick\\'s brother Myron, became a talent agent, joining MCA at first and picking up many new clients after MCA acquired Leland Hayward\\'s talent agency. She eventually moved to International Famous Agency, which later became ICM, where she worked for the rest of her career. Among others, she represented actors Alec Guinness, John Gielgud, Ralph Richardson, Rex Harrison, Fredric March, Patricia Neal and Montgomery Clift. Her background acquiring literary properties also led her to represent writers such as Lillian Hellman, Isak Dinesen and, for 40 years, Arthur Miller.

              " 'The Beltrán Leyva Organization (BLO), also known as the Beltrán Leyva Cartel; Spanish: Cártel de los Beltrán Leyva (CBL), was a Mexican drug cartel and organized crime syndicate, formerly headed by the five Beltrán Leyva brothers: Marcos Arturo, Carlos, Alfredo, Mario Alberto, and Héctor. Founded as a Sinaloa Cartel, the Beltrán Leyva cartel was responsible for transportation and wholesaling of cocaine, heroin and marijuana (and the production of the last two). It controlled numerous drug trafficking corridors, and engaged in human smuggling, money laundering, extortion, kidnapping, murder and gun-running.The BLO was one of Mexico\\'s most powerful drug cartels, which had effectively infiltrated the ranks of various Mexican government agencies and Mexico\\'s Interpol. Its last known leader, Héctor Beltrán Leyva, was arrested in October 2014, having had a multimillion-dollar bounty placed on him by the governments of both the United States and Mexico. On August 11, 2011 the capture of one of the cartel\\'s former top lieutenants, called \"the last Beltran-Leyva link of any importance\", prompted Mexican authorities to declare the cartel disbanded and extinct. == History == Born in the Sinaloan countryside in the 1960s, the Beltrán Leyva brothers—Arturo, Carlos, Alfredo, Mario Alberto and Héctor—worked closely with their cousin, Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán, the leader of the Cartel, during decades of smuggling. Sensing a void in the rival Gulf Cartel after Osiel Cárdenas\\' arrest on March 14, 2003, the organization began to move into Gulf Cartel territory. The gangs fought each other in northern Mexican cities, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of people, including some civilians, police and journalists.In 2004 and 2005, Arturo Beltrán Leyva led powerful groups of assassins to fight for trade routes in northeastern Mexico for the Cartel. Through the use of corruption or intimidation, the Beltrán Leyva Cartel was able to infiltrate Mexico\\'s political, judicial and police institutions to feed classified information about anti-drug operations, and even infiltrated the Interpol office in Mexico.During 2010, former Beltran Leyva cartel lieutenant Óscar Osvaldo García Montoya (a.k.a. El Compayito) attempted to regroup some cartel remnants under a gang he called La Mano Con Ojos. García Montoya was arrested on August 11, 2011; the Attorney General of Mexico had placed a 5 million pesos (US$400,000) bounty for his capture. Mexican authorities stated that García Montoya was \"the last Beltrán-Leyva link of any importance\", and that the cartel has been disbanded.Allied forces of Los Zetas and Beltrán-Leyva remnants clashed on April 28, 2012 with gunmen of the organization in the Choix mountains. At least 32 armed men were confirmed dead. The renewed fighting in Sinaloa state between the BLO and the Cartel is supposedly sparked by the incursion of the Cartel and its allies in Nuevo Laredo, traditionally the biggest Zeta stronghold.The last cartel leader, Héctor Beltrán Leyva, was captured on October 1, 2014 while eating at a popular restaurant in San Miguel de Allende, Guanajuato. The U.S. was offering a reward of US$5 million for information leading to his arrest. while the Mexican government was offering a US$2.1 million reward. === Switch of alliances === The arrest of Beltrán Leyva Organization leader Alfredo Beltrán Leyva (a.k.a. El Mochomo) (\"The Desert Ant\") on January 20, 2008, was a huge blow to the organization, as he allegedly oversaw large-scale drug-smuggling operations and was a key money launderer for the cartel. In apparent revenge for the arrest of his brother Alfredo, Arturo ordered the assassination of the commissioner of the Federal Police, Édgar Eusebio Millán Gómez, and other top federal officials in the Mexican capital. One group of these hit men was captured in a Mexico City house with dozens of assault rifles, pistols, grenade launchers, 30 hand grenades, and bullet-proof jackets bearing the legend FEDA—the Spanish acronym for \\'Special Forces of Arturo\\'. Apparently, the Beltrán Leyva brothers blamed their partner Joaquin \"Chapo\" Guzmán for their brother\\'s arrest, and in retaliation ordered the assassination of Guzmán\\'s son, 22-year-old Édgar Guzmán López, which was carried out in a shopping center parking lot by at least 15 gunmen using assault rifles and grenade launchers.The residual impact of Alfredo\\'s arrest not only undermined long-term alliances, but resurrected animosities between rival cartel leaders Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzmán and Arturo\\'s new allies, the Juárez Cartel, and provided the catalyst behind the bloodshed in Mexico\\'s most-violent city: Ciudad Juárez. The Beltrán Leyva brothers, and those loyalists who departed the Cartel with them, allied with Los Zetas, causing an escalation of conflict in strongholds shared uneasily by \"old\" leaders. In February 2010, the Beltrán Leyva Cartel and Los Zetas engaged in a violent turf war against the new alliance integrated by the Gulf Cartel, Sinaloa Cartel and La Familia Cartel in the border city of Reynosa, Tamaulipas, rendering some border towns \"ghost towns\".Official reports from early 2010 revealed infighting for control of the cartel and its territory. One faction was led by lieutenants Édgar Valdez Villarreal and Gerardo Alvarez-Vazquez, while the other was led by Héctor Beltrán Leyva and his lieutenant Sergio Villarreal Barragán. In April 2010, Héctor Beltrán Leyva created a short-lived cell or branch in Morelos state called South Pacific Cartel (Cártel del Pacífico Sur) best known for having employed a 12-year-old gunman and executioner. == Assets == The cartel\\'s assets included: Dominance over drug and other illegal activities at airports in Mexico, Monterrey, Toluca, Cancún, and Acapulco; Hotels and restaurants constructed to launder money in Cancún, Acapulco, Cozumel, and other resorts; A working agreement with Los Zetas. Supply corridors for moving marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamine from the Andes to the Arctic; Capability to extort, launder money, run guns, smuggle humans, promote prostitution and carry out kidnappings; Operations in Mexico City, Chiapas, Guerrero, Guanajuato, Mexico State, Morelos, Nuevo León, Querétaro, Quintana Roo, Sinaloa, Sonora, and Tamaulipas, as well as in the United States and Canada; Access to some high-ranking public figures and Army personnel whom they bribed or intimidated.Former suppliersThe Beltrán Leyva brothers\\' Colombian cocaine supplier, Ever Villafane Martínez, was arrested in Morelos in August 2008. After that, the organization pursued a relationship with Víctor and Darío Espinoza Valencia of Colombia\\'s Norte del Valle cartel. == Bounty == The United States offered a US$5 million reward for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of Héctor Beltrán Leyva. == Captures == Alfredo Beltrán Leyva was captured on January 20, 2008, and Arturo was killed by Mexican Marines in a shootout on December 16, 2009. Two weeks following Arturo\\'s death, on December 30, 2009, Carlos Beltrán Leyva was captured by the Mexican Federal Police in Culiacán, Sinaloa after showing authorities a fake driver\\'s license of an alias he was living under. Carlos was arrested on charges outstanding since 2008, including drug trafficking, criminal conspiracy, money laundering and illegal firearms.At the same time as federal police arrested Carlos, Beltrán Leyva associates who allegedly murdered four relatives—a mother, siblings and an aunt—of one of the marines involved in the shootout that killed Arturo, were also arrested by Mexican authorities, with a hitman allegedly confessing to the crimes. The killings, allegedly in retaliation for Arturo\\'s death, happened hours after the marine\\'s funeral. On April 22, 2010, cartel lieutenant Gerardo Alvarez-Vazquez was captured on the outskirts of Mexico City; the U.S. had been offering a $2 million U.S. bounty for his arrest. Edgar Valdez Villarreal, the leader of Los Negros cartel enforcement, was arrested on August 30, 2010 outside Mexico City. On January 18, 2011, José Jorge Balderas Garza, known as \"JJ\", the lieutenant and financial operator of the Valdez Villarreal faction, was captured. On September 12, 2010, Sergio Villarreal Barragán was arrested in the city of Puebla, east of Mexico City. Héctor Beltrán Leyva was captured by the Mexican Armed Forces on October 1, 2014.The August 11, 2011 arrest of Óscar Osvaldo García Montoya (a.k.a. El Compayito), a cartel lieutenant, was called \"the last Beltran-Leyva link of any importance\".On April 16, 2014, the second-in-command, Arnoldo Villa Sánchez, was captured by Mexican authorities in the Condesa district in Mexico City.On October 1, 2014, Hector Beltran Leyva and business associate German Goyenechea, who had become the cartel\\'s chief financier, were both captured while eating at a popular restaurant in San Miguel de Allende.On October 11, 2017, the U.S. Justice Department arrested Sajid Emilio Quintero Navidad, 36, at the San Ysidro Port of Entry. He was charged with money-laundering and drug-trafficking. Navidad, who also goes by the name El Cadete is the cousin of fugitive drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero, who is allegedly responsible for the killing of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration Agent Enrique \"Kiki\" Camarena.On July 4, 2019, Héctor Huerta Ríos, the leader of the Beltran-Leyva Cartel in Nuevo Leon who was previously arrested in 2009, was killed by a rival cartel after being shot while driving in Jalisco. His wife, who was in the car with her husband and their two daughters, identified his body to police the next day. == Split == Following the death of Arturo Beltran Leyva on December 16, 2009, and the arrest of Edgar Valdez Villarreal on August 30, 2010, the Beltran Leyva brothers lost much of their influence. The cartel then divided into separate independent groups: Los Mazatlecos in Sinaloa and Nayarit, an armed loyalist wing of the Beltrán Leyva brothers, currently fighting the Sinaloa Cartel in northern Sinaloa.

After the Japanese established the puppet Provisional Government of the Republic of China in 1938 (part of the collaborationist Republic of China from 1940 to 1945), these and other privately owned railways in the territory of Provisional Government were nationalised to create the North China Transportation Company (a subsidiary of the South Manchuria Railway, which designated these the Mikana (ミカナ) class.After the end of the Pacific War, these locomotives were passed on to the Republic of China Railway.

              " 'St. Lawrence is a neighbourhood located in downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The area, a former industrial area, is bounded by Yonge, Front, and Parliament Streets, and the Canadian National railway embankment. The Esplanade off Yonge St., lined with restaurants, cafés and hotels runs through the middle of the area. In previous times, the area was sometimes referred to as \\'St. Lawrence Ward\\' or more often today as \\'St. Lawrence Market\\', synonymous with the large retail vendor market which is the neighbourhood\\'s focal point. The area is the site of a large city-sponsored housing project of the 1970s, which revitalized an old \\'brownfields\\' area. The boundaries of the St Lawrence Neighbourhood Association and the St Lawrence Market BIA are somewhat larger than those noted above. Both groups have boundaries that extend from Yonge to Parliament Streets and Queen Street East to the rail corridor. == History == The town of York was founded in 1793, on a site of ten blocks north of Front Street between George and Berkeley streets, in present day Old Town, Toronto. Much of the area of today\\'s St. Lawrence neighbourhood was then located in Toronto Harbour, the shoreline being just south of Front Street. The area was infilled to provide more land for port and industrial uses adjacent. St. Lawrence was the first industrial area of York. The first parliament buildings in Upper Canada in 1793 were constructed on the southwest corner of Parliament and Front Street. The buildings have long since gone from the site, but a discovery was made in 2000 when a quick dig of the property revealed the old parliament building footings, in addition to some pottery from that time. The City of Toronto and the Government of Ontario now own most of the property. There is a marker for the First Parliament Buildings at Parliament Square Park, West of Parliament Street, East of Berkeley, and South of Front. The marker is actually south of the original site. The Ontario Heritage Trust set up the Parliament Interpretive Centre at Front and Berkeley to provide historical information about this parliament that was destroyed by American troops during the War of 1812. The Centre was open from 2012 to 2015, in remembrance of the 200th anniversary of the war. A Saturday farmers\\' market began operation at Front and Jarvis in 1803. The current South Market building, south of Front, is open Tuesday through Saturday, selling foods and other goods. The North Market building hosted a farmers\\' market on Saturdays and a flea market on Sundays until its demolition in 2016, at which time they both moved to a temporary building south of The Esplanade. A new, larger North Market Building is being built on the original site, with planned completion in 2021. In 1834, Toronto\\'s first city hall was built on the southwest corner of King St. East & Jarvis St. at the old \\'Market\\' building from 1834 (the year of Toronto\\'s incorporation from the former town of York) to 1844. This building was damaged during the great fire of 1849 and replaced with the grandiose St. Lawrence Hall and a market building (today\\'s North Market). A larger city hall, also housing a police station and jail cells, opened in 1845 with a 140 feet (43 m) long facade running along the south side of Front Street. City Hall was moved out of the area in 1899 to what is now Old City Hall before moving once again to its current location. The 1845 city hall was integrated into the St. Lawrence Market South building in 1899. In 1972, the remains of the city hall were converted into the \"Market Gallery\". The old council chamber is all that remains of the original city hall and is located on the gallery\\'s second floor. By 1840, the waterfront was completely taken over by government and merchant wharves. The Esplanade, a 100 feet (30 m)-wide road, was proposed, just south of Front Street, with new water lots made from cribbing and filling of the shore to the south. The waterfront was extended to a survey line from the point of the Gooderham windmill west to a point due east of the old Fort Rouillé. Ostensibly for carriages and carts, the roadway eventually became primarily the route for rail lines in the central core. In exchange for 40 feet (12 m) of the Esplanade, the railways underwrote the infilling of the harbour. The Esplanade and infill project was completed by 1865.Commercial activity along Toronto\\'s bustling harbour provided employment and was the primary place of entry to the quickly growing, burgeoning city. The convergence of the railway lines and the wharves must have worked because in 1873 historian Henry Scadding so eloquently wrote in his book Old Toronto of The Esplanade \"...It has done for Toronto what the Thames Embankment has done for London...\" In the 1920s, the railway lines were relocated to a new, raised viaduct to the south of the Esplanade. This left the current section between Yonge and Berkeley Street. By the 1960s, the industrial uses of the area had declined, leaving numerous empty sites and decrepit buildings. In the 1970s it was decided by Toronto Mayor David Crombie to turn the area into a new residential neighbourhood, but one that would not make the same mistakes of the \"urban renewal\" housing projects of earlier decades. The neighbourhood was to be integrated into the city with no clear boundaries. It would contain a mix of commercial and residential as with both subsidized and market-oriented housing, mostly rowhouse or low-rise apartments. The neighbourhood was planned by Alan Littlewood and Frank Lewinberg, with the influence of American-Canadian urban planner Jane Jacobs playing a crucial role. Design guidelines prepared by Eberhard Zeidler were deemed too modern by planners and politicians and were not implemented, replaced instead by the urban design work of George Baird. Many of the developments were not completed until well into the 1990s. Since that time, the St. Lawrence neighbourhood has been critically acclaimed as a major success in urban planning. In many ways, it has become the model for the design and planning of new urban communities across North America. == Character == Some of the most interesting architecture in the city can be found in St. Lawrence, one notable landmark is the Flatiron building, known for its distinct narrow, wedge shape where Wellington St. merges with Front. Built in 1892, it was the first of this type of building constructed in North America. If viewed from the east, the wedge can be seen in the foreground with the financial skyscrapers and the CN tower rising in the background. While many of the old industrial buildings along Front Street east of Jarvis have been demolished since the 1950s, several old industrial buildings remain, including old meat-packing plants from the 1800s. Several have been converted into lofts or commercial space. Front Street is lined on both sides with restaurants. At the intersection of Front and Yonge are two performing arts houses, the St. Lawrence Centre for the Arts, Toronto\\'s \"centennial\" project and Meridian Hall. == See also == List of oldest buildings and structures in Toronto St. Lawrence Market == References == White, Richard (2011). \"Jane Jacobs and Toronto, 1968-1978\".

Her first romance with another woman, which ended in heartbreak when the woman revealed she had a long-distance girlfriend, served as a loose inspiration for the relationship of the characters Marina Ferrer and Jenny Schecter.In 2007, she and a group of women in the entertainment and tech industries launched a social networking site called OurChart for lesbians and their friends. OurChart was online until 2008, when it was shutdown. At that time, a spin-off show of The L Word entitled The Farm was in development and two pilots were being written by Chaiken, although Showtime never bought the series.Chaiken produced a documentary for Showtime in 2014 titles L Word Mississippi: Hate the Sin. The film focused on multiple lesbian women, telling their experiences of being gay in the Deep South. During this time, Chaiken was also a showrunner on ABC's The Black Box, which was cancelled after one season.Chaiken is credited with first developing the TV adaptation of The Handmaid's Tale, which became a successful Hulu original show. Chaiken left the project during development to become the show-runner on Fox's Empire, but was still credited as an executive producer.In January 2019, Showtime announced that it had ordered a full season of the sequel to The L Word. The show aired December 8, 2019, titled The L Word: Generation Q, and picks up where the original series ended, set ten years later.More recently, her company, Little Chicken Productions, signed an overall deal with Universal Television. In 2020, Chaiken co-created the show Law & Order: Organized Crime, a spin-off of the long-running series Law & Order. The following year, she worked as a writer and showrunner for the series, but was replaced by Barry O'Brien part-way through production of the second season. == Personal life == Chaiken has been married to LouAnne Brickhouse, a former executive at Disney, since 2013. They live in the Laurel Canyon area of the Hollywood Hills in Los Angeles and have nurtured more than 100 species of birds and other fauna, which they document regularly on an Instagram account.Chaiken is co-parent to twin daughters Tallulah and Augusta with her former partner, English architect Miggi Hood. == Filmography == === Television === == Awards == == See also == List of female film and television directors List of lesbian filmmakers List of LGBT-related films directed by women == References == == External links == Ilene Chaiken at IMDb\",\n",

Stradiņš was the first person to use the term \"Third Awakening\" (at the expanded plenum of the Writers\\' Union of the Latvian SSR in June 1988), opposing those who had begun to call the national revival in the period of glasnost the Second Awakening (the first being that of the Young Latvians). Blanks sought to distinguish between the New Current (in Latvian: Jaunā strāva) — a broad and radical socio-economic, political, and cultural movement that lasted from the late 1880s until the 1905 Revolution, led by Rainis and influenced by Marxism — from the more nationalistic direction taken in 1903 by Ernests Rolavs and Miķelis Valters; to Blanks, the 1890s \"could be stricken completely from the history of national thought.\" He saw Rolavs\\' and Valters\\' nationalist Latvian Social Democratic Union (in Latvian: Sociāldemokratu savienība; sometimes abbreviated SDS) — a radical socialist group critical of the cosmopolitanism of the Latvian Social Democratic Workers\\' Party (Latvijas sociāldemokrātiskā strādnieku partija; LSDSP) — as the direct ideological descendants of the Young Latvians. It was the SDS (and especially Valters) that first began to formulate demands for Latvia\\'s political autonomyStradiņš based his view of the national revival in the 1980s on Blanks, considering the Second Awakening similarly: he viewed the organization of the Latvian riflemen, the activities of the Latvian émigrés in Switzerland, the Latvian refugees\\' relief committee in Russia, the proclamation of independence and the battles for independence as coming under the heading of the Second Awakening. Less frequently, some have seen the New Current and the 1905 Revolution — and sometimes even the Khrushchev Thaw — as National Awakenings. == References == == See also == Ernests Blanks: Latvju tautas ceļš uz neatkarīgu valsti.

              " 'The Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Handel, Op. 24, is a work for solo piano written by Johannes Brahms in 1861. It consists of a set of twenty-five variations and a concluding fugue, all based on a theme from George Frideric Handel\\'s Harpsichord Suite No. 1 in B♭ major, HWV 434. They are known as his Handel Variations. The music writer Donald Tovey has ranked it among \"the half-dozen greatest sets of variations ever written\". Biographer Jan Swafford describes the Handel Variations as \"perhaps the finest set of piano variations since Beethoven\", adding, \"Besides a masterful unfolding of ideas concluding with an exuberant fugue with a finish designed to bring down the house, the work is quintessentially Brahms in other ways: the filler of traditional forms with fresh energy and imagination; the historical eclectic able to start off with a gallant little tune of Handel\\'s, Baroque ornaments and all, and integrate it seamlessly into his own voice, in a work of massive scope and dazzling variety.\" == Background == The Handel Variations were written in September 1861 after Brahms, aged 28, abandoned the work he had been doing as director of the Hamburg women\\'s choir (Frauenchor) and moved out of his family\\'s cramped and shabby apartments in Hamburg to his own apartment in the quiet suburb of Hamm, initiating a highly productive period that produced \"a series of early masterworks\". Written in a single stretch in September 1861, the work is dedicated to a \"beloved friend\", Clara Schumann, widow of Robert Schumann. It was presented to her on her 42nd birthday, September 13. At about the same time, his interest in, and mastery of, the piano also shows in his writing two important piano quartets, in G minor and A major. Barely two months later, in November 1861, he produced his second set of Schumann Variations, Op. 23, for piano four hands. From his earliest years as a composer, the variation was a musical form of great interest to Brahms. Before the Handel Variations he had written a number of other sets of variations, as well as using variations in the slow movement of his Op. 1, the Piano Sonata in C major, and in other chamber works. As he appeared on the scene, variations were in decline, \"little more than a basis for writing paraphrases of favorite tunes\". In Brahms\\'s work the form once again became restored to greatness. Brahms had been emulating Baroque models for six years or more. In particular, between the time he wrote his previous Two Sets of Variations for piano, (No. 1, Eleven Variations on an Original Theme, in D major (1857) and No. 2, Fourteen Variations on a Hungarian Melody, in D major (1854)), Op. 21, and the Handel Variations, Op. 24, Brahms did a careful study of \"more rigorous, complex and historical models, among others preludes, fugues, canons and the then obscure dance movements of the Baroque period. Two gigues and two sarabandes that Brahms wrote to develop his technique are extant today. The results of these historical studies are seen in his choice of Handel for the theme, as well as his use of Baroque forms, including the Siciliana dance form (Var. 19) from the French school of Couperin and, in general, the frequent use of contrapuntal techniques in many variations. One aspect of his approach to variation writing is made explicit in a number of letters. \"In a theme for a [set of] variations, it is almost only the bass that has any meaning for me. But this is sacred to me, it is the firm foundation on which I then build my stories. What I do with a melody is only playing around ... If I vary only the melody, then I cannot easily be more than clever or graceful, or, indeed, [if] full of feeling, deepen a pretty thought. On the given bass, I invent something actually new, I discover new melodies in it, I create.\" The role of the bass is critical. Identifying the bass as the essence of the theme, ...Brahms advocated using it to control the structure and character of individual variations and of the entire set. But by this he apparently did not mean retaining in the variations the bass line of the theme or even its harmonies ... To invent something actually new and to discover new melodies in the bass give the bass a role at once passive and active. While maintaining the structure of the theme—the passive bass, so to speak—Brahms may actively create melodies and figurative patterns (including melodies \"discovered in\" the bass), project different contrapuntal textures, and draw on an expanded harmonic vocabulary, sometimes interpreting the melody as the bass of the harmony or regarding major and minor or sharp and flat versions of the same passage as equally valid and available. The result is a great diversity of expression and character founded on a relatively strict conception of the \"given\" material. Brahms also took into careful account the character of the theme, and its historical context. Unlike the great model of Beethoven\\'s Diabelli Variations, where the variations departed widely from the character of the theme, Brahms\\'s variations expressed and developed the character of the theme. Because the theme for the Handel variations originated in the Baroque era, Brahms included forms such as a siciliana, a musette, a canon and a fugue.Still not fully established in his career in 1861, Brahms had to struggle to get the work published. He wrote to Breitkopf & Härtel, \"I am unwilling, at the first hurdle, to give up my desire to see this, my favourite work, published by you. If therefore, it is primarily the high fee that stops you taking it, I will be happy to let you have it for 12 Friedrichsdors or, if this still seems too high, 10 Friedrichsdors. I very much hope you will not think I plucked the initial fee arbitrarily out of the air. I consider this work to be much better than my earlier ones; I think it is also much better adapted to the demands of performance and will therefore be easier to market ...\"The theme of the Handel Variations is taken from an aria in the third movement of Handel\\'s Harpsichord Suite No. 1 in B♭ Major, HWV 434 (Suites de pièces pour le clavecin, published by J. Walsh, London 1733 with five variations). Brahms himself owned a copy of the 1733 First Edition. The appeal of the aria for Brahms might have been its simplicity: its range is restricted to one octave; the harmony is plain, with every note taken from the B-flat major scale; it \"made an admirably neutral starting-place\". While Handel had written only five variations on his theme, Brahms, with the piano as his instrument rather than the more limited harpsichord, enlarged the scope of his opus to 25 variations ending with an extended fugue. Brahms\\'s use of Handel exemplifies his love of the music of the past and his tendency to incorporate it and transform it in his own compositions. Of the overall concept of the work, Malcolm MacDonald writes \"Some of Brahms\\'s models in this monumental work are easy enough to identify. In the scale and ambition of his conception both Bach\\'s \\'Goldberg\\' and Beethoven\\'s \\'Diabelli Variations\\' must have exercised a powerful if generalized influence; in specific features of form Beethoven\\'s \\'Eroica\\' Variations is a closer parallel. But the overall structure is original to Brahms.\" And MacDonald suggests what might have been a more contemporary source of inspiration, the Variations on a Theme of Handel, Op. 26, by Robert Volkmann. \"Brahms might well have known that large and often admirable work, published as recently as 1856, which Volkmann based on the so-called \\'Harmonious Blacksmith\\' theme from the Air with Variations in Handel\\'s E major Harpsichord Suite.\" == Structure == In Music, Imagination, and Culture Nicholas Cook gives the following concise description: \"The Handel Variations consist of a theme and twenty-five variations, each of equal length, plus a much longer fugue at the end which provides the climax of the movement in terms of duration, dynamics, and contrapuntal complexity. The individual variations are grouped in such a way as to create a series of waves, both in terms of tempo and dynamics, leading to the final fugue, and superimposed on this overall organization are a number of subordinate patterns. Variations in tonic major and minor more or less alternate with each other; only once is there a variation in another key (the twenty-first, which is in the relative minor). Legato variations are usually succeeded by staccato ones; variations whose texture is fragmentary are in general followed by more homophonic ones. ... the organization of the variation set is not so much concentric—with each variation deriving coherence from its relationship to the theme—as edge-related, with each variation being lent significance by its relationship with what comes before and after it, or by the group of variations within which it is located. In other words, what gives unity to the variation set ... is not the theme as such, but rather a network of \\'family resemblances\\', to use Wittgenstein\\'s term, between the different variations.\" There are various opinions about the organization of the Handel Variations. Hans Meyer, for example, sees the divisions as nos. 1–8 (\\'strict\\'), 9–12 (\\'free\\'), 13 (\\'synthesis\\'), 14–17 (\\'strict\\') and 18–25 (\\'free\\'), culminating in the fugue. William Horne emphasizes paired variations: nos. 3 and 4, 5 and 6, 7 and 8, 11 and 12, 13 and 14, 23 and 24. This helps him to group the set as 1–8, 9–18, 19–25, with each group ending with a fermata and preceded by one or more variation pairs. John Rink, focusing on Brahms\\'s dynamic markings, writes, \"Brahms takes pains to control the intensity level throughout the twenty-five variations, maintaining a state of flux in the first half, and then keeping the temperature perceptibly low after the peak in Variations 13–15 until the massive \\'crescendo\\' towards the fugue begins in Variation 23. We thus find a sensitivity to motion and momentum that complements—and possibly transcends in importance to the listener—the elegance of structure about which so many authors have (legitimately) enthused. Unity is maintained, at least in part, by using Handel\\'s key signature of B♭ major throughout most of the set, varied by only a few exceptions in the tonic minor, and by repeating Handel\\'s four-bar/two-part structure, including the repeats, in most of the work. === The variations === The performer of the audio files in this section is Martha Goldstein. ==== Theme. Aria ==== Handel\\'s theme is divided into two parts, each four bars in length and each repeated. The elegant aria moves in stately quarter notes in 44 time with \"a ceremonial character typical of its period\". The harmonic progressions are elementary. Every bar except one has one or two decorations. The melody consists of a one-bar figure in the right hand consisting mostly of a trill and a turn; it is repeated in a rising sequence three times followed by a fourth descending repetition; a decorative flourish finishes the first half of the variation, which is then repeated. The left hand plays solid chords in support throughout, three quarter-note chords to each bar setting the pace followed by a rhythmic eighth-note chord leading to the next bar and emphasizing its first beat. The second half follows a similar pattern, varied mainly by alterations to the turns. ==== Variation 1 ==== Brahms\\'s first variation stays close to the melody and harmonies of Handel\\'s theme while changing its character completely. It uses staccato throughout and its syncopated accents are distinctly non-Baroque. The dynamic marking poco f (a bit louder), too, clearly separates it from Handel\\'s elegant aria. In tempo the variation seems much more hurried, crisp, even dance-like; each time the right hand \"pauses\" on an eighth note, the left hand fills in with sixteenth notes. At the end of the two sections, Brahms replaces Handel\\'s decorations with brilliant up- and down-scale runs. ==== Variation 2 ==== Minor-key inflections in Variations 2 to 4 increase the distance from Handel and lay the groundwork for Variations 5 and 6, in the tonic minor. Variation 2 is a subtle piece with a flowing, lilting rhythm. Complexity is added as Brahms uses a favourite technique, found throughout his works, with triple time in one voice—in this case, triplets in the right hand—against duple time in the other. While explicitly recalling the melody of Handel\\'s theme, the chromaticism of this variation adds to the sense of a world beyond the Baroque. In the first half the pattern is of phrases rising on the scale with a crescendo, then falling away in a shorter decrescendo. The second half climbs both in pitch and dynamics to a high climax, again falling away quickly. There is a smooth transition to the next variation. ==== Variation 3 ==== The elegant third variation, marked dolce, moves at a more leisurely pace, providing a sense of calm after two rather busy variations. It also provides a much-needed contrast with the following thunderous variation. Right and left hands alternate and overlap, the left imitating the right in a pattern of three eighth notes. The first note of each group is played staccato, adding to the sense of lightness. The occasional rolled chord adds interest. ==== Variation 4 ==== The fourth variation, marked risoluto, is a showpiece, with sixteenth notes played in octaves in both hands, strong accents (the sforzandos are frequently emphasized by six-note chords) and climaxes that rise a full octave higher than Handel\\'s theme. The charging, syncopated rhythm places the stress on the last sixteenth note of almost every beat. Although no tempo indications are given, this variation is often performed at great speed. ==== Variation 5 ==== After the mighty sounds of the previous variation, the lyrical fifth variation begins quietly. The change of mood is emphasized by a shift to the tonic minor (B♭ minor). This is the first variation in a key different from Handel\\'s. Numerous small crescendos and decrescendos underscore the espressivo marking. The melody moves upward at a measured pace in eighth notes while the left hand accompanies with broken chords in sixteenth notes in contrary motion. The mood is peaceful and tranquil. A pairing between this variation and the following one is created by the use of the tonic minor key signature and contrary motion. ==== Variation 6 ==== Like the preceding variation, this piece is in the tonic minor and features contrary motion, and the motives of the two variations are similar. Marked p sempre with legato phrasing, Variation 6 has a hushed, mysterious tone. The pace is measured, as both hands are written mainly in eighth notes with short sequences of sixteenth notes providing variety. Here Brahms uses counterpoint in the form of a two-part canon in octaves, including inverted canon for several measures in the second half. ==== Variation 7 ==== Echoing the pairing of Variations 5 and 6, the seventh variation is paired with the eighth. Returning to Handel\\'s original B♭ major, Variation 7 is fast, exciting, high-spirited, and fundamentally rhythmic in nature. A sustained drumbeat effect is created by the emphatic repetition of its upper notes and a staccato rhythm throughout all three voices. Because of the repeated upper notes, the focus moves to the inner voices. Numerous accents add further emphasis to the highly rhythmic character of this variation: in some bars in the first half, accents are placed on the last beat of the bar, while in the second half, the accents are yet more numerous, assigned to every beat except the last of each bar. Each half ends in a peak of excitement, marked forte with arpeggios in contrary motion. It leads seamlessly into 8. ==== Variation 8 ==== Variation 8 continues the rhythmic excitement of Variation 7, the left hand beating out, on the same note over and over, the same anapestic rhythm as the preceding variation. After a few bars, the two voices of the right hand are flipped. A fermata at the close provides a moment of silence before 9 begins and signals the end of the first section. ==== Variation 9 ==== Variation 9 slows the pace of the series, with a sense of grandeur as both treble and bass move in stately, ominous octaves. The piece is highly chromatic, and, like several earlier variations, treble and bass are in contrary motion throughout. Each two-bar phrase begins with two exclamatory sf chords, as if sounding an alarm. The variation starts an octave higher than Handel\\'s theme, and its repeated two-bar pattern continually ascends, increasing in tension, until the climax, when it reaches a full two octaves higher than Handel. ==== Variation 10 ==== In contrast to the preceding number, Variation 10 is Allegro energico, fast and exhilarating. Its rather odd effect sounds almost devoid of melody, as the main notes of the theme are scattered among various registers. The first half consists of a series of startling gestures that begin with large, loud chords (f energetico) in the higher registers followed by echoes progressively lower, ending deep in the bass in a series of single notes played pp. The second half rushes to a great climax. ==== Variation 11 ==== After the tension of Variations 7–10, the next two variations are sweet and melodic. Variation 11 uses counterpoint and has a simple, pleasant air with its rock-steady rhythm in the right hand while the left hand simply plays two notes to one. Variations 11 and 12 are another example of the pairing of variations which is so characteristic of the work. ==== Variation 12 ==== The quietness and delicacy of Variation 12 prepares for the return of the dark tonic minor in Variation 13. The left hand is similar to Variation 17, in the same rhythm as the left hand of Handel\\'s theme. ==== Variation 13 ==== Variation 13 returns to the tonic minor in a funereal mood. It is the middle variation of the set and, in the view of Denis Matthews, the emotional centre. Right-hand sixths play against rolled chords in the left, perhaps suggesting muffled drums. For Tovey the lugubrious tone suggests a \"kind of Hungarian funeral march\", while Malcolm MacDonald sees it as \"florid\" and \"a Hungarian fantasia\". Here Brahms abandons the usual repeat signs because each passage that would have been repeated is instead written an octave higher. Variations 13 and 14, while very different in character, are paired in being fast and exciting and in their use of parallel sixths in the right hand. ==== Variation 14 ==== Variation 14, marked sciolto (\"loose\") breaks the dark mood of Variation 13 and returns to the original key. With its extended trills and scalar runs in sixths in the right hand against broken octaves in the left hand, it is a virtuoso showpiece. The mood is of great energy, excitement, and high spirits. It leads without a break into the following variation. Donald Francis Tovey sees a grouping in Variations 14–18, which he describes as \"aris[ing] one out of the other in a wonderful decrescendo of tone and crescendo of Romantic beauty\". ==== Variation 15 ==== Following without a pause from the previous number, Variation 15, marked forte, is a bravura variation building relentlessly toward an exciting climax. It consists of a one-bar pattern, varied only slightly, of two declamatory chords in eighth notes in the higher registers, followed by lower sixteenth notes that echo Handel\\'s original turns. A prominent upbeat creates syncopated energy. It has been called an étude for Brahms\\'s Piano Concerto No. 2. It breaks the structural mould of Handel\\'s theme by adding one \"extra\" bar. In Brahms\\'s first autograph, Variations 15 and 16 were positioned in the reverse order. ==== Variation 16 ==== Variation 16 continues from Variation 15 as a \"variation of variation\", repeating the pattern of two high eighth notes followed by a run of lower sixteenth notes. It also forms another pairing with Variation 17. Baroque contrapuntal techniques appear again in this canon, described by Malcolm MacDonald as \"wittier\" than the canon of Variation 6. The left hand begins with two descending staccato eighth notes, immediately followed in the opposite hand by the two eighth notes inverted, a full four octaves higher. In each case, a figure in sixteenth notes follows in canonic imitation. The effect is light and exhilarating. ==== Variation 17 ==== In Variation 17, the absence of the sixteenth notes that were so prominent in the preceding two variations gives the impression of a slowing, despite the marking of più mosso. The effect is of gently falling raindrops, with gracefully descending broken chords in the right hand, piano and staccato, repeated throughout the work at various pitches. Each note is played twice, adding to the suggestion of a leisurely pace. ==== Variation 18 ==== Another \"variation of a variation\", paired with the preceding Variation 17. The accompaniment from the previous variation, which now echoes the melody of the aria, is now syncopated and alternating between the hands, while the \"raindrops\" are replaced by sweeping arpeggios. ==== Variation 19 ==== This slow, relaxing variation, with its lilting rhythm and 128 time, is written in the dance style of a Baroque French siciliana from the school of Couperin (Brahms had edited Couperin\\'s music). It uses chords almost exclusively in the root position, perhaps as another reminiscence of \"antique\" music. In a technique often used by Brahms, the melodic line is hidden in an inner part. This variation opens a lengthy quiet section which includes nos. 19–22, \"not noticeably interrelated\". ==== Variation 20 ==== From the outset, Variation 20 builds toward its climax. In contrast to the preceding variation, there is little of the Baroque in it with its chromaticism in both treble and bass and its thick textures (triads in the right hand against octaves in the left hand). Malcolm MacDonald refers to its \"organ-loft progressions\". ==== Variation 21 ==== Variation 21 moves to the relative minor (G minor). Like Variation 19, the theme is hidden, in this case by merely gracing the main notes of the theme in passing, thereby achieving a sense of lightness. It is another example of Brahms\\' use of polyrhythms, this time pairing three notes against four. ==== Variation 22 ==== The light mood of the preceding variation continues in Variation 22. Often referred to as the \"musical-box\" variation because of the regularity of its rhythm, underlined particularly by a drone bass, Variation 22 alludes to the Baroque musette, a soft pastoral air imitating the sound music of a bagpipe, or musette. It remains in the high registers, consistently above Handel\\'s theme, the lowest note being the repeated B♭ of the drone. The light mood prepares the way for the climactic, concluding section which, in Tovey\\'s words, comes \"swarming up energetically out of darkness\". ==== Variation 23 ==== At Variation 23 the rise toward a final climax begins. It is clearly paired with the following Variation 24, which continues its pattern but in a more hurried, more urgent manner. ==== Variation 24 ==== In preparation for the climactic final variation, Variation 24 intensifies the excitement, replacing the triplets of Variation 23 with masses of sixteenth notes. Clearly modeled on the preceding, it is another example of Brahms\\'s use of \"variation of variation\". ==== Variation 25 ==== An exultant showpiece, Variation 25 ends the variations and leads into the concluding fugue. Its strong resemblance to Variation 1 ties the set together, as they both feature a left hand which fills the pauses in the right. ==== Fugue ==== The powerful concluding fugue brings the variation set to a climactic close. Its subject, repeated many times from beginning to end, derives from the opening of Handel\\'s theme. At its most microscopic level, the subject comes solely from the ascending major second from the first two beats in the top voice of Handel\\'s theme. The ascending second is stated twice in sixteenth notes and repeated again a major third higher. This parallels the first measure of Handel\\'s theme, which ascends from B♭ to C to D to E♭. The following melodic line of the second measure resembles the second measure of Handel\\'s theme in general trajectory (Brahms\\'s theme is also strikingly similar to the subject of Fugue VI from Felix Mendelssohn\\'s Six Preludes and Fugues, Op. 35, also in B♭ major). Julian Littlewood observes that the fugue has \"a dense contrapuntal argument which recalls Bach more than Handel\". Denis Matthews adds that it is \"more redolent of one of Bach\\'s great organ fugues than any in The Well-Tempered Clavier, with inversions, augmentation and double counterpoint to match, and a great peroration over a swinging dominant pedal-point\". Despite its magnitude, Littlewood suggests, the fugue avoids separation from the rest of the set by its comparable texture. \"In this way it systematically creates a web of links between past and present, achieving synthesis rather than quotation or parody.\" Michael Musgrave in The Music of Brahms writes,\"Brahms brings his subject, derived, like that of the Diabelli fugue, from the theme, into contrapuntal relationships involving diminution, augmentation, stretto, building to the final peroration through a long dominant pedal with two distinct ideas above. But the pianism is an equal part of the conception, and in this, the most complex example of Brahms\\'s virtuoso style, the characteristic spacings in thirds, sixths and wide spans between the hands are employed as never before. Indeed, the pianistic factor serves to create the great contrasts within the fugue, which transcends a traditional fugal movement to create a further set of variations, in which many of the previous textures are recalled in the context of the equally transformed fugal theme.\" == Reception and aftermath == An entry in Clara Schumann\\'s diary about the Handel Variations gives an idea of how close the relationship between her and Brahms was, as well as Brahms\\'s sometimes extraordinary insensitivity: \"On Dec 7th I gave another soirée, at which I played Johannes\\' Handel Variations. I was in agonies of nervousness, but I played them well all the same, and they were much applauded. Johannes, however, hurt me very much by his indifference. He declared that he could no longer bear to hear the variations, it was altogether too dreadful for him to listen to anything of his own and to have to sit by and do nothing. Although I can well understand this feeling, I cannot help finding it hard when one has devoted all one\\'s powers to a work, and the composer himself has not a kind word for it.\" Yet in the following spring (April 1862) Brahms wrote, in a note to a critic to whom he was sending a copy of the work, \"I am fond of it and value it particularly in relation to my other works\".Clara Schumann premiered the work in Hamburg on December 7, when she visited Brahms\\'s home town to give a series of performances, which also included the Piano Concerto No. 1 in D minor—which had not been well received when Brahms introduced it to Leipzig in the Gewandhaus in January 1858—and the premiere of the Piano Quartet No. 1 in G minor. Clara\\'s performance of the Handel Variations in Hamburg was a triumph, which she repeated soon afterward in Leipzig. During that winter, Brahms also gave performances of the Handel Variations, as a result of which he made minor alterations to the score. Publication came in July 1862 by Breitkopf & Härtel. With the \"complete failure,\" as he described it to Clara, of his first large-scale orchestral work, the First Piano Concerto, the Handel Variations became an important landmark in the developing career of Brahms. Another seven years passed before his reputation was firmly established by A German Requiem in Bremen in 1868, and it took a full fifteen years before he made his mark as a symphonist with his first symphony (1876). During what was probably the first meeting of Brahms and Richard Wagner in January 1863, Brahms performed his Handel Variations. Despite the great differences between the two men in musical style and an underlying tension based on musical politics—Brahms championing a more conservative approach to music while Wagner, along with Franz Liszt, called for \"the music of the future\" with new forms and new tonalities—Wagner complimented the work graciously, if not wholeheartedly, saying, \"One sees what still may be done in the old forms when someone comes along who knows how to use them\". == Arrangements == The piece is often heard in a version that was arranged for orchestra by the British composer and Brahms enthusiast Edmund Rubbra in 1938. The orchestration was first performed at a Royal Philharmonic Society concert conducted by Adrian Boult. The ballet Brahms/Handel, made by New York City Ballet balletmaster Jerome Robbins in collaboration with Twyla Tharp, was set to this orchestration. The work has also been transcribed for solo organ by French-Canadian composer Rachel Laurin. == Notes == == External links == Variations on a Theme by Händel Op.24 (Brahms, Johannes): Scores at the International Music Score Library Project Free score Detailed listening guide based on a recording by Martin Jones Sleeve notes from a recording by Seta Tanyel (free registration required) Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Handel played by Leon Fleisher Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Handel on YouTube played by Murray Perahia',\n",

              " 'Cow, also titled Only Stwpd Cowz Txt N Drive, is a 30-minute public information film directed by Peter Watkins-Hughes with assistance from Gwent Police and Tredegar Comprehensive School in Wales. The August 2009 film was a co-production by Gwent Police and Tred Films, with special effects by Zipline Creative Limited. The film features original music by Stuart Fox, a composer and sound designer from Gloucester, England. A previous film, \"Lucky Luke,\" was intended to warn about the dangers of joyriding; \"Cow\" was intended to be a sequel of sorts. The film was shown to students in the UK and was released on YouTube. The film, using local drama students as actors, tells the story of 17-year-old Cassie \"Cow\" Cowan (Jenny Davies), who texts and drives and gets into a car accident; her friends Emm and Jules (Amy Ingram and Laura Quantick) are in the vehicle with her. Four people die as a result of Cassie\\'s actions. The police intended for the film to be aired in British schools.The film cost \\'a few thousand pounds\\' to make. 300 drama students auditioned for the film.The full film is shown to students in the United Kingdom. As of 2009 the film had not been aired on television stations in the United States. In 2010, a modified 30-second version of the public service announcement was to begin airing during certain hours on 13 television stations in central and upstate South Carolina. == Story == Cassie \"Cow\" Cowan, Emma \"Emm\" Williams, and Jules O\\'Shea, three teenage friends who work at the same hardware shop, agree to leave work early in order to cheer up Jules, who threw up on duty after discovering that she was pregnant. On the way home, Cassie texts while driving and her car drifts across the road and collides head-on with an inattentive driver on the outskirts of Tredegar, Gwent. Subsequently, a third driver crashes into them. Emma and Jules are killed in the accident, along with a couple in the second vehicle involved in the crash, while the couple\\'s young son sustains several injuries but survives. It is not clear what the outcome is for the third driver or a young baby of the second driver. The rest of the film depicts the accident\\'s aftermath and consequences. The police break the news to bereaved relatives, and Cassie herself almost dies in hospital, but is revived. At the hospital, Cassie\\'s father meets the grandmother of the couple\\'s son. When a local paper reports that she was breathalyzed shortly before the accident, her parents are ostracised by the local community (she was stopped by the police for speeding, but passed the test). Jules\\' boyfriend Morgan appears on television to express his grief about the death of their unborn baby, although he had previously dumped her because of the pregnancy. Eventually, despite her mother\\'s reassurances, Cassie is sentenced to seven years imprisonment for causing death by dangerous driving. == Reception == The clip of the public service announcement received worldwide attention, and the clip received over one million views on YouTube by 25 August 2009 and reuploaded on 28 May 2016. The video received attention due to the graphic content. The film earned honours in the Advertising Age\\'s weekly Creativity Top 5 video. and became an overnight worldwide internet hit after being shown on the US The Today Show television show.Donny Deutsch, advertising executive and American TV host, said \"I will show this to every kid I know, and I salute the police department\" and \"I would really implore various local stations: Run this stuff, put this on the air. It will help.\" Mick Giannasi, the then chief constable of Gwent Police, said \"The messages contained in the film are as relevant to the people of Tennessee as they are to the residents of Tredegar.\" He also said \"Texting and driving can have tragic consequences, and the more this film is viewed, the better.\"The part of the film with the crash was edited on YouTube in 2022 as part of the longrunning trend featuring American rapper Cupcakke, interpolating her sexualised lyrics into popular culture references. The scenario where Cassie was texting was replaced with getting distracted by a Cupcakke remix whilst driving, then showing the crash scene, with the song Into You by Ariana Grande mixed with Cupcakke\\'s lyrics such as \\'put it down my butt\\' and \\'breastfeeding while we f**ck\\'. == Cast == Jenny Davies – Cassie \"Cow\" Cowan Amy Ingram – Emma \"Emm\" Williams Laura Quantick – Jules O\\'Shea Roger Evans – Michael Cowan Adrienne O\\'Sullivan – Laura Cowan Phylip Harries – Mr. Williams Jason May – Mr. O\\'Shea Gareth Price Stevens – Morgan Davis Margaret John – Joyce Richards == References == == External links == Cow at IMDb \"Graphic Texting & Driving PSA.\" – CBS News (WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT) \"Shocking Video Warning To Teen Drivers.\" – WXII',\n",

              " 'The Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football program represents the Georgia Institute of Technology in the NCAA Division 1 Collegiate Competitors in the sport of American football. The Yellow Jackets college football team competes in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Coastal Division of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). Georgia Tech has fielded a football team since 1892 and, as of 2020, has an all-time record of 740–518-43 through the 2020 season. The Yellow Jackets play in Bobby Dodd Stadium at Historic Grant Field in Atlanta, Georgia, holding a stadium max capacity of 55,000. Considered as one of the most successful national collegiate football programs for over a century, it still remains a college football powerhouse. The Yellow Jackets have won four national championships across four decades (1917, 1928, 1952, 1990), including 16 conference titles. Among the team\\'s former coaches are John Heisman, for whom the Heisman Trophy is named, and Bobby Dodd, for whom the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award and the school\\'s stadium are named. Heisman led the team to the most lopsided game in football history, 222–0, and both Heisman and Dodd led Tech\\'s football team to national championships. Dodd also led the Jackets on their longest winning streak — 8 straight games — against the University of Georgia in Tech\\'s most time-endured rivalry, called Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate. For his part, Heisman led Georgia Tech to an undefeated 12–0–1 record in the Georgia Tech–Clemson football rivalry. A number of successful collegiate and professional football players have also played for Tech. The program has 48 first-team All-Americans and over 150 alumni who have played in the NFL. Among the most lauded and most notable players the school has produced are Maxie Baughan, Calvin Johnson, Demaryius Thomas, Keith Brooking, Joe Hamilton, Joe Guyon, Pat Swilling and Billy Shaw. In the 21st century, Georgia Tech has won their Coastal Division and appeared in the ACC Championship Game four times since 2006. In addition to its conference and national championships, legendary coaches, and talented players, Tech\\'s football program has been noted for its many historic traditions and improbable game finishes throughout the years, including its famed fight song Ramblin\\' Wreck from Georgia Tech and its famous blocked field goal return against No. 9 Florida State in 2015. == History == === Early history (1892–1944) === Tech began its football program with several students forming a loose-knit troop of footballers called the Blacksmiths. On November 5, 1892, Tech played its first football game against Mercer University. The team lost to Mercer 12–6 in Macon, Georgia. Tech played two other games during their first season and lost both of them for a season record of 0–3. Discouraged by these results, the Blacksmiths sought a coach to improve their record. Leonard Wood, an Army officer and Atlantan, heard of Tech\\'s football struggles and volunteered to player-coach the team. Over the span of 1892–1903, Tech only won 8 games, tied in 5, and lost 32. In 1893, Tech played against the University of Georgia for the first time. Tech defeated Georgia 28–6 for the school\\'s first-ever victory. The angry Georgia fans threw stones and other debris at the Tech players during and after the game. The poor treatment of the Blacksmiths by the Georgia faithful gave birth to the rivalry now known as Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate. In 1902, Jesse Thrash was the team\\'s first All-Southern selection. He began the season as a sub and closed it as the undisputed star of the Tech team. Oliver Jones Huie was selected by Ga Tech\\'s athletic association to coach the football team for the 1903 season when the team won 3 and lost 5 games. A professional coach was desperately needed if Tech wished to build a truly competitive football program. The first game of the 1903 season was a 73–0 destruction at the hands of John Heisman\\'s Clemson; shortly after the season, Tech offered Heisman a coaching position. John Heisman put together 16 consecutive non-losing seasons, amassed 104 wins, including three undefeated campaigns and a 32-game undefeated streak. From 1915 to 1918 Georgia Tech went 30–1–2 and outscored opponents 1611–93 utilizing his jump shift offense. He would also muster a 5-game winning streak against the hated Georgia Bulldogs from 1904 to 1908 before incidents led up to the cutting of athletic ties with Georgia in 1919. Heisman was hired by Tech for $2,250 a year and 30% of the home ticket sales. Heisman would not disappoint the Tech faithful as his first season was an 8–1–1 performance, the first winning season since 1893. One source relates: \"The real feature of the season was the marvelus advance made by the Georgia School of Technology which burst from fetters that kept it in the lowest class for ten years.\" His team posted victories over Georgia, Tennessee, University of Florida at Lake City, and Cumberland, and a tie with his last employer, Clemson. He suffered just one loss, to another first year coach, Mike Donahue of Auburn. The 1905 team went 6–0–1. The 1906 team beat Auburn for the first time. Stars of this early period for Tech include Lob Brown and Billy Wilson. The 1907 and 1908 teams were led by \"Twenty Percent\" Davis. Pat Patterson was All-Southern in 1910. Patterson was captain in 1911, a season in which future coach William Alexander was a reserve quarterback. Heisman helped students construct Grant Field in 1913, when Alf McDonald was quarterback. The 1915 team went undefeated. Arguably the most notable game of Heisman\\'s career was the most lopsided victory in college football history. In 1916, Cumberland College ended its football program and attempted to cancel a scheduled game with Heisman\\'s Jackets. Heisman, however, was seeking vengeance for a 22–0 baseball loss to Cumberland in the spring of 1916, a game in which Heisman suspected Cumberland of hiring professional players to pose as Cumberland students. Heisman refused the game\\'s cancellation and Cumberland mustered up a group of commonfolk to play Tech. Tech won 222–0. Neither team achieved a first down other than a touchdown, as Cumberland either punted or turned the ball over before a first down and Tech scored on almost every play from scrimmage. Jim Preas, Tech\\'s kicker, kicked 16 point after tries, which is still a record for a single game. In 1917 Tech won its first national championship behind the backfield of Everett Strupper, Joe Guyon, Al Hill, and Judy Harlan. It was the first national title for a Southern team, and for many years the \"Golden Tornado\" was considered the finest team the region ever produced. Strupper and captain Walker Carpenter were the first two players from the Deep South ever selected first-team All-American. Heisman challenged Pop Warner\\'s undefeated Pittsburgh team to a decisive national championship game, but he declined. In the next season of 1918, Tech lost a lopsided game to Pitt 32–0. Center Bum Day became the first player from the south selected for Walter Camp\\'s first team. In 1919, Auburn upset Tech for the SIAA crown. By 1919, Heisman had divorced his wife and felt that he would embarrass his wife socially if he remained in Atlanta. Heisman moved to Pennsylvania, leaving Tech in the hands of William Alexander.William Alexander had attended Georgia Tech and after graduating as valedictorian of his class in 1912, taught mathematics at Tech and served as Heisman\\'s assistant coach. In 1920, he was given the job of head coaching Tech\\'s football team. Alexander retained Heisman\\'s \\'jump shift\\' offense, and in his first season he saw Tech win an SIAA title behind captain Buck Flowers, the first Georgia Tech player inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. Tech suffered its only loss again to Warner\\'s Pitt, and finished the season with a win over rival Auburn. Tackle Bill Fincher made Camp\\'s first team All-America. The 1921 and 1922 teams also claimed SIAA titles. The 1921 team suffered its only loss to undefeated, eastern power Penn State. Tech was captained by fullback Judy Harlan. Future Tech fullback Sam Murray was asked about a certain strong runner in the 1930s, \"He\\'s good. But if I were playing again, I would have one wish – never to see bearing down upon me a more fearsome picture of power than Judy Harlan blocking for Red Barron.\" Barron ran for 1,459 yards on the season. From 1923 to 1925, though Tech failed to claim a conference title, it had one of its best-ever players: fullback Doug Wycoff, \"the outstanding back of the South for the past two years.\" Coach Alexander recalled \"The work of Douglas Wycoff against Notre Dame two years in succession was brilliant in the extreme, as was his plunging against Penn. State when we defeated them twice.\" Tech and UGA renewed their annual rivalry game in 1925 after an eight-year hiatus. Quarterback Ike Armstrong thought the game clock read five seconds remaining in the game when in actuality it was five minutes. Williams set up his offense for a field goal and kicked it to put Tech up 3–0 on first down. Luckily for Williams, Tech won 3–0. In 1927, Alexander instituted \"the Plan.\" Georgia was highly rated to start the 1927 season, known as the \"dream and wonder team\", and justified their rating throughout the season going 9–0 in their first 9 games. Alexander\\'s plan was to minimize injuries by benching his starters early no matter the score of every game before the UGA finale. On December 3, 1927, UGA rolled into Atlanta on the cusp of a national and conference title. Tech\\'s well rested starters were helped by the rain and shut out the Bulldogs 12–0, ending any chance of UGA\\'s first national title, while netting the SIAA title. Alexander\\'s 1928 team amassed a perfect record and won the school\\'s second national title. The team was led at center by captain Peter Pund and upset Notre Dame. \"I sat at Grant Field and saw a magnificent Notre Dame team suddenly recoil before the furious pounding of one man–Pund, center\", said legendary coach Knute Rockne. \"Nobody could stop him. I counted 20 scoring plays that this man ruined.\" The 1928 team was also the very first Tech team to attend a bowl game. The team was invited to the Rose Bowl to play California. The game was a defensive struggle, with the first points scored after a Georgia Tech fumble. The loose ball was scooped up by California center Roy Riegels and then accidentally returned in the wrong direction. Riegels returned the ball all the way to California\\'s 3-yard line. After Riegels was finally stopped by his own teammate at the 1-yard line, he was swarmed by a group of Tech players. The Bears opted to punt from the end zone. The punt was blocked and converted by Tech into a safety giving Tech a 2–0 lead. Cal scored a touchdown and a point after but Tech would score another touchdown to win the game 8–7. This victory made Tech the 10–0 undefeated national champion of 1928. Coach Alexander found campus spirit to be particularly low during the Great Depression. His football program (and the other athletic teams) had very few student fans attending the games. He helped to establish a spirit organization known as the Yellow Jacket Club in 1930 to bolster student spirit. The group would later become the Ramblin\\' Reck Club. Georgia Tech football declined following the 1928 championship, and did not post another winning record until 1937. The 1939 team was SEC co-champion. The only retired jersey in Georgia Tech football history is No. 19. The number belonged to Tech halfback Clint Castleberry. Castleberry played on the No. 5 ranked 1942 Tech team as a true freshman and was third place in the 1942 Heisman Trophy voting. After ending his freshman year at Tech, Castleberry elected to join the war effort and signed up for the Army Air Corps. While co-piloting a B-26 Marauder over Africa, Castleberry, his crew, and another B-26 disappeared and were never heard from again. Castleberry has been memorialized on Grant Field ever since, with a prominent No. 19 on display in the stadium. The 1943 and 1944 teams won SEC titles. Coach Alexander finally retired in 1944 after winning 134 games as head coach and taking Tech to the Rose Bowl, Orange Bowl, Cotton Bowl Classic, and Sugar Bowl. To this day, Alexander has the second most victories of any Tech football coach. The record for most coaching victories in Tech history is still held by Alexander\\'s then coordinator and eventual successor Bobby Dodd. === Bobby Dodd era (1945–1966) === President Blake R Van Leer believed athletics were an important part of collegiate life, he championed that belief with coaches like Dodd where he was recorded being proud of Dodd\\'s accomplishments. Bobby Dodd took over the Georgia Tech football program following Coach Alexander\\'s retirement in 1944. He did not believe in intense physical practices but rather precise and well executed practices. Dodd\\'s philosophy translated to winning. He set the record for career wins at Tech at 165 career coaching wins including a 31-game winning streak from 1951 to 1952. He also managed to capture two Southeastern Conference Titles and the 1952 National Title, which concluded a 12–0 perfect season and Sugar Bowl conquest of previously undefeated, seventh ranked Ole Miss in a season that also included victories over Orange Bowl champions, 9th ranked, Alabama; 15th ranked Gator Bowl champions Florida Gators football; 16th ranked Duke; and a 7–4 rival Georgia. While 9–0 Michigan State would capture the AP and UP titles, the Yellow Jackets\\' were ranked first in the International News Service poll. Dodd also understood the deep-seated rivalry with the University of Georgia. His teams won 8 games in a row over the Bulldogs from 1949 to 1956 outscoring the Bulldogs 176–39 during the winning streak. This 8–game winning streak against Georgia remains the longest winning streak by either team in the series. Dodd would finish his career with a 12–9 record against the Bulldogs. In 1956, much controversy preceded the 1956 Sugar Bowl. Segregationists tried to keep Pitt fullback/linebacker Bobby Grier from playing because he was black. Georgia’s governor publicly threatened to remove funding if Georgia Tech’s president Blake R. Van Leer did not cancel the game. Dodd backed Van Leer in his desire to move forward with the game. Ultimately, Bobby Grier played making this the first integrated Sugar Bowl and is regarded as the first integrated bowl game in the Deep South.Dodd\\'s tenure included Georgia Tech\\'s withdrawal from the Southeastern Conference. The initial spark for Dodd\\'s withdrawal was a historic feud with Alabama Crimson Tide Coach Bear Bryant. The feud began when Tech was visiting the Tide at Legion Field in Birmingham in 1961. After a Tech punt, Alabama fair-caught the ball. Chick Granning of Tech was playing coverage and relaxed after the signal for the fair catch. Darwin Holt of Alabama continued play and smashed his elbow into Granning\\'s face causing severe fracturing in his face, a broken nose, and blood-filled sinuses. Granning was knocked unconscious and suffered a severe concussion, the result of which left him unable to play football ever again. Dodd sent Bryant a letter asking Bryant to suspend Holt after game film indicated Holt had intentionally injured Granning. Bryant never suspended Holt. The lack of discipline infuriated Dodd and sparked Dodd\\'s interest in withdrawing from the SEC. Another issue of concern for Dodd was Alabama\\'s and other SEC schools\\' over-recruitment of players. Universities would recruit more players than they had roster space for. During the summer practice sessions, the teams in question would cut the players well after signing day thus preventing the cut players from finding new colleges to play for. Dodd appealed the SEC administration to punish the \"tryout camps\" of his fellow SEC members but the SEC did not. Finally, Dodd withdrew Georgia Tech from the SEC in 1964. Tech would remain an independent like Notre Dame and Penn State (at the time) during the final four years of Dodd\\'s coaching tenure. In 1967, Dodd passed the head coach position to his favorite coordinator, Bud Carson. Dodd simply retained his athletic director position, which he had acquired in 1950. He would not retire from athletic directing until 1976. === Bud Carson era (1967–1971) === Bud Carson was Tech\\'s defensive coordinator in 1966. His job was to appease the Tech fan base Bobby Dodd had accumulated. Carson was not the charismatic leader like Dodd but rather a strategy man that enjoyed intense game planning. Carson\\'s most notable achievements included recruiting Tech\\'s first ever African American scholarship athlete and being the first Tech head coach to be fired. Carson recruited Eddie McAshan to play quarterback in 1970. After several Summer practices, McAshan won the starting quarterback job and became the first African American quarterback to start for a major Southeastern university. This decision initially polarized Georgia Tech\\'s fan base, but after winning his first 4 starts and leading Tech to a 9–3 season after three straight 4–6 seasons, McAshan won the hearts of the Tech faithful. McAshan\\'s besting of UGA in the annual rivalry game made McAshan a fixture on campus. The following season, however, led to Carson\\'s demise. In 1971, Tech went 6–6 and a fan base used to Bobby Dodd\\'s 8 wins per season average forced Carson out by James E. Boyd\\'s hand. Carson went on to form the Steel Curtain Pittsburgh Steelers defense. === Bill Fulcher era (1972–1973) === Bill Fulcher supplanted Bud Carson. Fulcher appeared to be the right choice but quit after two seasons, overwhelmed by racial incidents. Fulcher\\'s tenure included a terrible feud with Eddie McAshan, which peaked before the 1972 UGA game. McAshan had requested additional tickets for the game so that his family could attend. Fulcher refused the ticket request and McAshan sat out of practice in protest. Fulcher responded by suspending the quarterback for the UGA game and the upcoming Liberty Bowl. The story exploded on the national scene when Jesse Jackson attended the UGA game, allowing McAshan to sit with him outside of the stadium in protest. === Pepper Rodgers era (1974–1979) === Pepper Rodgers was hired soon after Fulcher quit. Rodgers was hired away from the UCLA Bruins and like Carson and Fulcher, simply could not return Tech to its national prominence of Dodd\\'s era, and after six seasons, Rodgers had accumulated only 34 wins and barely a 50% winning percentage. Rodgers flamboyant demeanor shortened his welcome at the school, and Athletic Director Doug Weaver replaced him with Bill Curry. Homer Rice became Athletic Director and attempted to reinvigorate Tech\\'s program by joining the Atlantic Coast Conference in 1980. === Bill Curry era (1980–1986) === Bill Curry had no experience as a head coach but was a refreshing change after the flamboyant Rodgers. Curry\\'s early years saw Tech reach its lowest point in modern history. His first two Tech teams from 1980 to 1981 went 2–19–1, with the only bright spots being a brilliant 24–21 victory over Bear Bryant\\'s Alabama team at Legion Field to open the 1981 season and a 3–3 slug fest in 1980 with then No.1 rated Notre Dame at Grant Field. Things had gotten so bad, they could only get better. He slowly rebuilt the team, restored a winning mentality to the Georgia Tech fan base, and in 1985 Tech won 9 games, including a 17–14 victory over Michigan State in the All American Bowl. Tech\\'s 1984–1985 teams featured the \"Black Watch\" defense. The Black Watch defense was created by defensive coordinator Don Lindsey and featured linebackers Ted Roof and Jim Anderson, safety Mark Hogan, and lineman Pat Swilling. The elite defensive players were awarded black stripes down the center of their helmets and black GT emblems on the side of their helmets. Curry\\'s leadership and ability to build a winning program sparked interest from the Crimson Tide and Alabama hired Curry away from Tech in 1986. === Bobby Ross era (1987–1991) === After Curry\\'s departure, Tech hired the talented Maryland Terrapins Coach Bobby Ross, who departed a Maryland athletic program in turmoil after the Len Bias tragedy. Bobby Ross came from Maryland after winning three ACC titles over four years. Ross\\' first season at Tech experienced a severe talent vacuum after Curry\\'s departure, and the players Ross inherited resisted the changes he demanded. The team only won two games, and Ross contemplated ending his coaching career after a humbling loss to Wake Forest in 1987. Ross decided to remain at Tech and continued to rebuild Tech\\'s program. The turning point came in 1989 with the recruitment of Shawn Jones and several other key freshman. After two seasons and only five total wins, Jones helped the Jackets rebound at the end of the 1989 season. In Jones\\' sophomore season, Tech powered through their schedule and won the ACC. The four-game unbeaten streak in 1989 extended all the way through 1990 and into the 1991 Citrus Bowl. The key victory in the streak was a huge 41–38 come from behind upset victory over then No.1 ranked Virginia in Charlottesville before a nationwide TV audience. Tech demolished Nebraska 45–21 in the 1991 Citrus Bowl, finishing the season 11–0–1, and earning a share of the 1990 National Title with the Colorado Buffaloes. Tech\\'s winning streak ended against Penn State in the 1991 Kick Off Classic. Ross and Jones never replicated that 1990 season but managed to win 8 games in 1991 making Shawn Jones one of the most heralded quarterbacks in Tech history. Ross was offered a head coach position after the 1991 season for the San Diego Chargers, which he took. === Bill Lewis era (1992–1994) === After first considering Ross assistant coaches, Ralph Friedgen and George O\\'Leary, Tech hired Bill Lewis away from East Carolina soon after Ross\\' departure. When Lewis was hired, the Tech faithful hoped he would continue to build on Ross\\' success. He had just led East Carolina to an 11–1 record and a final ranking of ninth in the nation. However, Lewis\\' first season at Tech in 1992 saw the Jackets collapse to only a 5–6 record just two years removed from a national championship. Preseason All-American Shawn Jones suffered from nagging injuries, leaving Tech\\'s offense inept. After Jones\\' fourth year ran out, redshirt freshman Donnie Davis stepped in to fill his shoes in 1993, which saw another 5–6 season. In just two years, Lewis had completely squandered the successful momentum established by Bobby Ross. During the Summer of \\'94, George O\\'Leary was rehired as defensive coordinator. With Davis injured in spring practice, Lewis recruited Tom Luginbill as his replacement. Luginbill was a proficient passer at Palomar College, a junior college in California, and his first two games in 1994 showed promise. Tech almost upset Arizona who was projected as the No. 1 team in the nation by Sports Illustrated and won 45–26 over Western Carolina. However, Tech lost its next six games before Lewis was fired with three games remaining in the season. O\\'Leary was named interim coach for the rest of the season. === George O\\'Leary era (1994–2001) === Georgia Tech lost their final three games, including a 48–10 drubbing at the hands of Georgia. Despite this, Tech dropped the \"interim\" tag from O\\'Leary\\'s title and named him head coach in 1995. O\\'Leary\\'s first season saw Senior Donnie Davis return as starter and Tech won 6 games. O\\'Leary\\'s second season saw the emergence of Joe Hamilton as starter when Brandon Shaw struggled in his first two starts. Hamilton would eventually lead the Jackets back to bowl contention and Tech attended its first bowl in six years, the 1997 Carquest Bowl. Hamilton\\'s prowess as a runner and passer thrilled the Georgia Tech fans. Offensive coordinator Ralph Friedgen utilized a complex offense with Hamilton that featured option football mixed in with complex timing routes. Hamilton racked up yardage, touchdowns, and wins for Tech. In 1998, Hamilton and Tech\\'s high powered offense won 10 games and a season ending victory over Notre Dame in the Gator Bowl. Hamilton\\'s senior year put him on the national stage. He was a leading candidate for the Heisman Trophy against rushing phenomenon Ron Dayne. Hamilton passed for over 3,000 yards and rushed for over 700 yards. But while Hamilton dazzled, the Georgia Tech defense was a liability (they allowed around 28 points per game), and may have ultimately cost Hamilton the 1999 Heisman Trophy. In a late-season, nationally televised game against Wake Forest, Tech gave up 26 points and Hamilton threw two interceptions and no touchdowns. As an indirect result, Dayne went on to win the Heisman (Joe was runner-up). Hamilton\\'s Georgia Tech career ended on a sour note in the 2000 Gator Bowl against the Miami, where the Jackets lost 28–13. The following season, redshirt junior George Godsey, a more traditional pocket passer, succeeded Hamilton at the helm of Tech\\'s powerful offense. The drop-off was minimal—Godsey continued where Hamilton left off, winning 9 games in 2000 and 8 games in 2001. In 2000, Godsey also led Tech to their third straight victory over the archrival Georgia Bulldogs.The end of the 2001 season saw George O\\'Leary entertain a coaching offer from Notre Dame after Bob Davie announced resignation as Irish head coach. O\\'Leary was eventually awarded the position, but it was revoked shortly thereafter when Notre Dame discovered that O\\'Leary had fabricated several aspects of his resume. He claimed to have played three years for the University of New Hampshire and to have attained a master\\'s degree from New York University; in actuality, he had attended NYU but did not graduate, and he never played a down of New Hampshire football. Following O\\'Leary\\'s departure, Mac McWhorter was named interim head coach for Georgia Tech\\'s bowl game, a victory over Stanford in the 2001 Seattle Bowl. === Chan Gailey era (2002–2007) === The following spring, Chan Gailey was hired to replace O\\'Leary as Georgia Tech\\'s head coach. Chan Gailey came to Georgia Tech in 2002 after head coaching stints with the Dallas Cowboys, Samford Bulldogs, and Troy Trojans. Gailey\\'s first team in 2002 managed to win seven games under the quarterbacking of A.J. Suggs. The most notable game of the 2002 season was an upset of National Title Contender North Carolina State. Georgia Tech rallied in the fourth quarter to upset NC State and end Philip Rivers\\'s Heisman Trophy hopes. In 2003, eleven Georgia Tech players were found academically ineligible. Despite the academic losses and the playing of true freshman Reggie Ball, Gailey would lead Tech to a seven-win season and humiliation of Tulsa in the Humanitarian Bowl. P.J. Daniels racked up over 300 yards rushing in the effort. 2004 and 2005 saw Georgia Tech improve talent and skill wise but Tech won seven games again. Star Calvin Johnson arrived as a true freshman in 2004. His performance against Clemson in 2004 helped cement Johnson\\'s place in the annals of all-time Tech greats. Two off-the-field problems affected the Yellow Jackets\\' 2005 season. First, Reuben Houston, a starting cornerback, was arrested for possession of over 100 pounds of marijuana. Houston was dismissed from the football team immediately following this arrest but a later court order forced Coach Gailey to allow Houston to return to the team. Houston would see little playing time following the court order. At the end of the 2005 season, an NCAA investigation found that 11 ineligible players had played for the Yellow Jackets between the 1998 and 2005 seasons. These players played while not making progress towards graduation on the NCAA-approved schedule. The football victories for that season were initially revoked, and Georgia Tech was put on two years of NCAA probation. Twelve football scholarships were stricken from Georgia Tech\\'s allotment for the 2006 and 2007 freshman classes. The Georgia Tech Athletic Department appealed this decision by the NCAA, and the records were restored but scholarship reductions and probation remained. Athletic Director Dave Braine retired in January 2006, and Dan Radakovich was hired as Athletic Director. Gailey\\'s most successful year at Georgia Tech was in 2006 with nine victories and the ACC Coastal Division championship. The Yellow Jackets football team reached its first New Year\\'s Bowl since the 1999 Gator Bowl and played the West Virginia Mountaineers in the Gator Bowl. Tashard Choice led the ACC in rushing yards and Calvin Johnson led the ACC in receptions and receiving yardage. After an impressive 33–3 victory at Notre Dame to open the 2007 season, the team slid to finish 7–6. On the morning of Monday, November 26, 2007, Gailey was fired from the Yellow Jackets, two days after another heartbreaking loss to the University of Georgia. The Yellow Jackets\\' Athletic Department hired Paul Johnson, then the head coach at Navy and former Georgia Southern head coach, as Gailey\\'s replacement on December 7, 2007. === Paul Johnson era (2008–2018) === On Friday, December 7, 2007, less than two weeks after Georgia Tech announced the firing of Chan Gailey, Paul Johnson was announced as the new Georgia Tech head football coach. Johnson was hired under a seven-year contract worth more than $11 million. Johnson immediately began installing his unique flexbone option offense at Georgia Tech. By the regular season\\'s end, Johnson had led the Yellow Jackets to a 9–3 record including an ACC Coastal Division Co-Championship and a 45–42 win in Athens, Georgia over arch-rival UGA, Tech\\'s first win against the Bulldogs since 2000. In recognition of his accomplishments in his first season, Johnson was named 2008 ACC Coach of the Year by the Atlantic Coast Sports Media Association as well as the CBSSports.com coach of the year. Several weeks after Johnson\\'s defeat of rival Georgia, Georgia Tech rewarded Johnson with a new contract worth $17.7 million, a 53% raise that made him the second highest paid coach in the ACC before he had even completed his first year in the conference. In 2009, Johnson led the Yellow Jackets to historic wins over Florida State in Tallahassee, No. 4 Virginia Tech (breaking an 0–17 losing streak to top five opponents at Grant Field in the past 47 years), and Virginia in Charlottesville. The jackets went on to defeat the Clemson Tigers to make them ACC champions, a title that would be vacated on July 14, 2011, due to NCAA infractions. The Yellow Jackets went on to lose to Iowa in the Orange Bowl, 24–14. Georgia Tech had another significant win over the No. 5 Clemson Tigers on October 29, 2011, giving the Tigers their first defeat of the season and enabling QB Tevin Washington to rush for 176 yards on 27 carries and a touchdown, breaking a school record. In 2012, Georgia Tech was declared the winner of the ACC Coastal Division on November 19, 2012, clinching it with a victory over Duke 42–24 and finishing with a 5-3 ACC record. Georgia Tech played against Florida State in the 2012 ACC Championship Game, which was coach Paul Johnson\\'s second appearance in the title game. The Yellow Jackets lost to the Seminoles 21–15. The 2014 Yellow Jackets, despite being predicted to finish 5th in Coastal Division by ESPN, garnered a 10–2 regular season record (6-2 ACC), including wins over then No. 19 Clemson and No. 9 Georgia to finish the regular season ranked No. 11 by the recently created College Football Playoff Committee. The highlight of the season was an overtime thriller that lead to the defeat of the Bulldogs in Athens, featuring Harrison Butker\\'s 53-yard field goal that sent the game into overtime, a 1-yard rushing touchdown by RB Zack Laskey, and a game clinching interception of UGA quarterback Hutson Mason\\'s throw by cornerback D.J. White. Georgia Tech met No. 4 Florida State in the 2014 ACC Championship Game in Charlotte, North Carolina, losing 37–35. Following their conference championship, Florida State was chosen in the top four (ranked No. 3), under which circumstance the Orange Bowl selected Georgia Tech (now No. 12) as its replacement to face the No. 7 Mississippi State Bulldogs on December 31, 2014. Justin Thomas led the Jackets to a dominating 49–34 win for the Yellow Jackets, finishing the season 11–3, No. 8 in AP poll and No. 7 in the American Coaches Poll. The 2015 season showed the Yellow Jackets a 3–9 record, after numerous injuries throughout the entire year. Their only notable win was a 22–16 upset over No. 9 Florida State on Tech\\'s Homecoming Night, when the Yellow Jackets blocked an attempted field goal by Florida State Kicker Roberto Aguayo, which was picked up by Lance Austin and returned for the game-winning touchdown. This was later coined the \"Miracle on Techwood Drive\". 2015 year marked the first year since 1996 that Georgia Tech did not make a bowl appearance. The next year, 2016, marked a bounce-back season, with the Yellow Jackets, led by team captain Justin Thomas, posting a 9–4 record, including a win over Kentucky in the TaxSlayer Bowl. 2016 also saw a 28–27 victory over Georgia in Athens featuring a 14-point comeback in the 4th quarter topped off by a 6-yard TD rush on third down by Qua Searcy, with 30 seconds left in the game. The Yellow Jackets took a step back in 2017, finishing 5–6 (4–4 ACC) with close losses to Tennessee (42–41 in 2OT) at the Chick Fil A Kickoff Game in the newly constructed Mercedes-Benz Stadium, and at Miami (25–24). Despite starting the 2018 season 1–3, the Yellow Jackets rallied to finish the regular season 7–5. The most notable victory was that against rival Virginia Tech, making Georgia Tech the only conference opponent to win three consecutive games in Lane Stadium against Virginia Tech. The season ended with the 2018 Quick Lane Bowl, where the Jackets fell 34–10 to the Minnesota Golden Gophers. Johnson announced his retirement on November 28, 2018, effective following the team\\'s bowl game. Geoff Collins was named Johnson\\'s replacement on December 7, 2018. === Geoff Collins era (2019–2022) === Geoff Collins was announced on December 7, 2018, as the new head coach, to replace the retiring Paul Johnson, starting the 2019 season. Collins was hired under a seven-year contract worth more than $23 million. Geoff Collins, a native of Conyers, Georgia, was previously the head coach at Temple, defensive coordinator at Mississippi State and Florida, and previously worked with Georgia Tech as a graduate assistant and recruiting coordinator. In his first season the Jackets experienced several significant losses. A loss against The Citadel was the Jackets\\' first loss against an FCS opponent since 1983, and a 45–0 loss to Virginia Tech was the Jackets\\' first shutout loss at Bobby Dodd Stadium since 1957.. Geoff Collins was fired from Georgia Tech along with athletic director Todd Stansbury on September 25, 2022 after three 3-win seasons and a 1-3 start in 2022. His final record at Georgia Tech was 10-28, one of the worst coaching records in Georgia Tech history. === Brent Key era (2022-present) === Brent Key, a Georgia Tech alumnus and football letterwinner who at the time was the OL coach, was named the interim for the rest of the 2022 season. Key led the Yellow Jackets to a 4-4 record over the final eight games of the 2022 season. The four wins included two road victories over nationally ranked opponents – a 26-21 win at No. 24 Pitt in his first game at the helm on October 1 and a 21-17 triumph at No. 13 North Carolina on November 19. The Jackets overcame a plethora of injuries (which included its top two quarterbacks.) to finish 5-7 overall and 4-4 in Atlantic Coast Conference play after a 1-3 start. The overall and conference win totals were Tech’s highest since 2018, as was its fourth-place finish in the ACC Coastal Division standings. Key’s Jackets also defeated the three teams that finished ahead of them in the coastal division. (North Carolina, Pitt and Duke). On Tuesday November 29, 2022 the interim tag was stripped and Key was named Georgia Tech’s 21st head football coach. == Conference affiliationsIndependent (1892–1893) == Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (1894–1913) Independent (1914–1915) SIAA (1916–1921) Southern Conference (1922–1932) Southeastern Conference (1933–1963) Independent (1964–1982) Atlantic Coast Conference (1983–present) == Championships == === National championships === Georgia Tech has been named national champion seven times by NCAA-designated major selectors.: 111–114 Georgia Tech claims the 1917, 1928, 1952, and 1990 championships.: 149–150 === Conference championships === Georgia Tech has won 16 conference championships, nine outright and seven shared.

Georgia Tech\\'s first four bowl game appearances, the Rose Bowl (1929), Orange Bowl (1940), Cotton Bowl Classic (1943), and Sugar Bowl (1944), marked the first time a team had competed in all four of the Major Bowl Games. † Interim == Home stadium == The Yellow Jackets play their home games at Bobby Dodd Stadium at Historic Grant Field in Atlanta, Georgia. Upon his hiring in 1904, John Heisman insisted that the Institute acquire its own football field. Grant Field was constructed to appease Heisman as well as bring a true home field advantage to Tech football.From 1893 to 1912, the team used area parks such as Brisbane Park, Ponce de Leon Park, and Piedmont Park as the home field. Georgia Tech took out a seven-year lease on what is now the southern end of Grant Field, although the land was not adequate for sports, due to its unleveled, rocky nature. In 1905, Heisman had 300 convict laborers clear rocks, remove tree stumps, and level out the field for play; Tech students then built a grandstand on the property. The land was purchased by 1913, and John W. Grant donated $15,000 towards the construction of the field\\'s first permanent stands; the field was named Grant Field in honor of the donor\\'s deceased son, Hugh Inman Grant.The stadium now sits amongst a unique urban skyline and is among the oldest Division I FBS football stadiums. In fact, the only Division I stadiums older are Franklin Field at the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard Stadium. Grant Field was natural grass until 1971. The astroturf was replaced by grass in 1995. The stadium officially holds 55,000 but has held up to 56,412 in 2005 and 56,680 in 2006.On February 26, 2019, Georgia Tech officials unveiled plans to hold one home game per season from 2020 to 2024 (five games total) at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, located less than one mile from the Georgia Tech main campus, with the series dubbed \"Mayhem at MBS\". However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, on July 30, 2020, the 2020 game against Notre Dame was moved back to Bobby Dodd Stadium and the agreement with MBS was extended to six years, running through 2026, comprising six games. == Logos and uniforms == The interlocking GT logo was created in 1967 at the request of Bobby Dodd. One of the varsity players was asked to design a logo for the helmets. Several variations of the design were submitted, including a yellow jacket design. The yellow jacket was not submitted because to make the insect look mean it would have to be stinging and therefore flying backwards. The interlocking GT was selected during the summer of 1967 and formalized into decals for the helmets. Over the years it became the official logo for Georgia Tech Athletics.When head coach Paul Johnson was hired in 2008, the Yellow Jackets adopted a new uniform style. One year later, the uniforms were altered to change the yellow to gold. A year after that, the uniforms were altered again. This time, the team adopted separate white uniforms for both home and away games, while retaining the previous styles\\' navy and gold jerseys for occasions when the Yellow Jackets could not wear white at home. In 2018, after nearly 40 years of being with Russell Athletic, Georgia Tech switched to Adidas. With the change came more consistent branding across all sports and a custom shade of gold for the team as well as new uniforms that entwine progressive and traditional elements. The uniforms were updated in 2022 with a more classic look. == Rivalries == === Georgia === Georgia Tech\\'s fight songs and cheers are tailored to belittle the Georgia Bulldogs, and the perennial catch-phrase for Georgia Tech fans for many decades has been \"To Hell with Georgia\". Georgia Tech and the Univ. of Georgia have played each other in football over 100 times (and hundreds more times in basketball, baseball, track and field, tennis, etc.) and this rivalry has become known as Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate. They have been heated rivals since 1893. The annual football game is by far the most important game on the schedule for most Georgia Tech sports fans. The winner of this game takes home the Georgia State Governor\\'s Cup. Georgia Tech trails Georgia in the all-time series 69–41–5 through the 2021 season. === Auburn === The Yellow Jackets have played the Auburn Tigers more than 90 times in football, and the series of football games between the two is the second-oldest in the Southeast. Auburn Univ. or A.P.I. is by far Georgia Tech\\'s second-most-often played opponent in football. The rivalry is also intense in basketball, baseball, etc. The first game took place on November 25, 1892 in Atlanta, Georgia. They played in the SIAA until it was defunct in 1922, before joining the Southeastern Conference. This rivalry lost some luster when the Georgia Tech Athletics discarded its membership in the Southeastern Conference in 1963 to become an independent institute. However, the Yellow Jackets continued their annual series of football games with the Auburn Tigers through 1987. Georgia Tech and Auburn play football games in occasional years, and games in other sports regularly. Even though the Yellow Jackets have joined the Atlantic Coast Conference for all sports in recent decades, from a historical perspective, the Auburn Tigers are Georgia Tech\\'s second-highest sports rivalry, behind only the Georgia Bulldogs. Auburn leads in the all-time series 47–41–4 with the last game played in 2005. === Clemson === The Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets and the Clemson Tigers have the fourth-most-played series in Georgia Tech football history. They have been rivals since 1898 and Clemson is Tech\\'s closest opponent, geographically, in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Also, in the ACC\\'s new two-division arrangement, each team has one football opponent in the opposite division which has been selected as the two teams\\' official cross-division rival that they play every year. The Yellow Jackets and the Clemson Tigers are one of these six pairs. In addition to their geographical closeness and the Heisman connection, the Georgia Tech – Clemson pairing is also a logical one because of both schools\\' long history in engineering, technology, and science education. Recently, the game has become known for last-minute, extremely close finishes. From 1996 to 2001, each of the six games was decided by exactly three points. In 1977 (before the Yellow Jackets had even joined the ACC), this football series was being considered for termination by the administration of Georgia Tech. Clemson football fans, in an effort to show their economic impact on the Atlanta, Ga., area, brought with them to Atlanta large stockpiles of two-dollar bills that were stamped with Clemson Tiger Paws. Georgia Tech leads Clemson in the all-time series 50–32–2 through the 2019 season. === Virginia Tech === The rivalry with Virginia Tech has grown considerably since Virginia Tech entered the ACC. In previous years, the teams played infrequently. The intra-conference game has often seen both teams ranked and the outcome has played a key part in determining the winner of the ACC Coastal Division. Since the ACC switched to Division format in 2005, the winner of this game has gone on to win the Coastal Division all but once, with VT winning six times and GT winning four times. Dubbed the Battle of the Techs, the game has seen some very close, very intense match-ups.Virginia Tech leads the series 11–8 through the 2022 season. === Tennessee === Georgia Tech and Tennessee hadn\\'t met since 1987 until losing a heart breaking Labor Day game in Atlanta in 2017 that renewed the rivalry between the two. When Georgia Tech was part of the Southeastern Conference they played annually. After Georgia Tech left the SEC in 1964, the teams still met until 1987. The series dates back to 1902 and Tennessee leads the series 25–17–2 with the last game played in the 2017 season. === Vanderbilt === The Yellow Jackets and the Vanderbilt Commodores first met in 1892 in Atlanta, Georgia with Vanderbilt winning 20–10. Since 1924, the winning team in the series has received a silver-plated cowbell with the year and final score of each game engraved on it. The trophy was created by Ed F. Cavaleri was described by the Atlanta Constitution as “a faithful Georgia Tech supporter though he did not attend the Jacket institution,” according to Georgia Tech\\'s website. Cavaleri purchased a cowbell at an Atlanta hardware store to use as a noise-maker while on his way to a game in 1924. The Commodores defeated Georgia Tech 3–0, however another fan in attendance suggested that Cavaleri award the bell to the winning team. The tradition was born and Cavaleri attended every game between the two teams from 1924 to 1967. The cowbell has a gold plate screwed into each side, with “GEORGIA TECH-VANDERBILT FOOTBALL TROPHY” inscribed at the top. Three columns list the year of each game, Georgia Tech\\'s points scored and Vanderbilt\\'s points scored. The results of the games from 1924 to 1967 are engraved on one side; the results from 2002, 2003, 2009 and 2016 are on the other. Georgia Tech is 20–15–3 against Vanderbilt in 38 games. The Yellow Jackets won the last matchup 38–7 in 2016. == Significant series == === Notre Dame === This series began in 1922. The Fighting Irish were a longtime rival of the Yellow Jackets and the two teams met periodically on an annual basis over the years, particularly from 1963 to 1981 when both schools were independents following Tech\\'s departure from the Southeastern Conference. The 1975 Georgia Tech-Notre Dame game marked the sole appearance in an Irish uniform of Rudy Ruettiger, the subject of the film Rudy. When Georgia Tech joined the Atlantic Coast Conference beginning in 1982, they were forced to end the series after 1981 because of scheduling difficulties. Consequently, the two teams have met very infrequently since then. Georgia Tech was the opponent in the inaugural game in the newly expanded Notre Dame Stadium in 1997, then a year later they met again in the Gator Bowl. The Fighting Irish and Yellow Jackets met in the 2006 and 2007 season openers and split both games. The rivalry resumed in 2015 with a 30–22 Irish win in South Bend, and will continue on a semi-regular basis as Georgia Tech and Notre Dame are scheduled to face off five times in the next ten years starting in 2020. Notre Dame is set to play Georgia Tech at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in 2020 and 2024. Georgia Tech will travel to South Bend in 2021. Notre Dame leads the series 29–6–1. === Duke === The Blue Devils and the Yellow Jackets have played 88 times in a series that dates back to 1933 and every year since. There was a long period of Duke dominance in the series from 1936 to 1945. The Blue Devils won all but one matchup including a six-game win streak, the longest in the series for Duke. The win streak also came in the glory days for Duke football, as the 1930s and 1940s featured the best Duke football teams. From 1946 to 1984, the series would be rather back and forth, teams exchanging periods of dominance over the other. Heading into the 1984 season, the series was deadlock at 25-25-1. But since then it has been nearly all Georgia Tech. In the 36 matchups since 1984, the Jackets have walked away with 26 victories, the Blue Devils have won just ten. Duke is Georgia Tech\\'s third-most common opponent all-time (behind only Georgia – 113 meetings and Auburn – 92). Georgia Tech leads the series 52–35-1. Georgia Tech won the last matchup 31–27 in 2021. === Alabama === The Crimson Tide and the Yellow Jackets have played 52 times in a rivalry that dates back to 1902. With the exception of a four-year break during World War II (1943–1946), they squared off annually from 1922 to 1963 as members of the Southern Conference (1922–1932) and Southeastern Conference (1933–1963). The rivalry continued for one season after Georgia Tech withdrew from the SEC in 1964, then was renewed again with games in six-straight seasons from 1979 to 1984. With 52 previous meetings, Alabama is Georgia Tech\\'s fifth-most-common all-time opponent (behind only Georgia – 114 meetings, Auburn – 92, Duke – 87 and Clemson – 85). Alabama and Georgia Tech announced in January 2020 that they are set to renew the rivalry after 36 years in 2030 and 2031. Alabama leads the series 28-21-3, and the Yellow Jackets won the last matchup 16–6 in 1984. === Tulane === The Yellow Jackets and the Tulane Green Wave first met on November 4, 1916 in Atlanta, Georgia. Tulane was the opponent at Bobby Dodd Stadium for the Jackets’ first-ever televised football game — a 13–7 win over the Green Wave on WSB-TV on Oct. 2, 1948. Tulane is the seventh-most frequent opponent for Georgia Tech (50 meetings). Tulane and Georgia Tech spent most of their athletic histories as members of the same conference: they were among the first to join the SIAA in 1894 then Georgia Tech left in 1921 and Tulane in 1922 to join the Southern Conference. Both schools moved yet again in 1932 to charter the Southeastern Conference, of which they were members until Tech\\'s departure in 1963 to become independent. Tulane followed suit in 1966, but they played each other yearly until 1982. Georgia Tech is now a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference, while Tulane is a member of the American Athletic Conference. The rivalry was renewed on September 6, 2014, in the first football game played on Tulane\\'s campus since Tulane Stadium was torn down in 1980. Georgia Tech leads the series 37–13. The Yellow Jackets won the last matchup 65–10 in 2015. == Traditions == Colors – Georgia Tech football features old gold and white uniforms with old gold helmets. Navy blue and black have been used as alternate jerseys. In 2006, Georgia Tech featured a throwback jersey based on Bud Carson-era uniforms. The jerseys were mustard gold and the helmets were white. Songs – The fight songs for Georgia Tech are \"Ramblin\\' Wreck from Georgia Tech\" and \"Up With the White and Gold\". If Georgia Tech scores a touchdown, then both songs are played, with Up With the White and Gold being played after the Yellow Jackets score and Ramblin\\' Wreck from Georgia Tech being played after the PAT is kicked. If Georgia Tech only kicks a field goal, \"Ramblin\\' Wreck\" is played. For some big plays, a shortened version of either song is played. Nicknames – Georgia Tech football teams have had several nicknames over the years including the \"Blacksmiths\", the \"Engineers\", the \"Golden Tornado\", or just the \"Techs\". Officially, the teams are called the \"Yellow Jackets\" or the \"Ramblin\\' Wreck\". Mascots – The \"Ramblin\\' Wreck\" and the yellow jacket \"Buzz\" are the mascots of Georgia Tech football. The \"Ramblin\\' Wreck\" is a 1930 Ford Model A Sports Coupe, and it has led the football team on to Grant Field every game since September 30, 1961. \"Buzz\" began pacing the sidelines of Grant Field as a mischievous anthropomorphized yellow jacket during the 1970s. \"Buzz\" was ranked the number three top mascot in all of college football by \"America\\'s Best\" and the \"Top Ten\" Web site. Yellow Jacket Alley – \"Yellow Jacket Alley\" is an event staged before every game. It is a players\\' walk in which the team and coaches walk from the buses to the stadium, and the fans surround and cheer the walking players. Steam Whistle – An industrial steam whistle has been present on Georgia Tech\\'s campus ever since the early industrial shop years. It typically was blown for the change of classes at five minutes before the hour. On football game days, the whistle is blown after every Yellow Jackets\\' score, and again after every Yellow Jackets\\' victory. Student Section – The student sections for the Yellow Jackets\\' home football games are primarily located in the North and South End Zones of Grant Field. Until the 2011 season, Flash Card displays were performed by the student section every football season since 1957. A semi-official student cheering section called the \"Swarm\" is located in the North End Zone adjacent to the marching band. The Swarm began in 1996. RAT Caps - Incoming Georgia Tech freshmen are referred to as RATs, which stands for Recruits At Tech, although in recent years the Student Government has begun incorrectly using Recently Acquired Tech Students. A RAT is encouraged to wear the gold colored beanie caps with the front bill worn turned up and bearing the students name, hometown, major, class year and the letters \"RAT\". A RAT should record the scores of each football game on the sides of their RAT Cap, written right side up for victories, upside down for losses, and sideways for ties. A RAT should write the \"Good Word\" on their caps: \"To HELL with georgia\". It is the responsibility of a RAT to know the fight songs, the Alma Mater, all of the cheers and the \"Good Word\". Before ACC conference regulations prohibited the practice, upperclassmen ordered \"RATs on the field\" before each home game, and RATs would line up in the end zone along both sides of the entry way from the locker room forming an alley way for the Ramblin\\' Wreck to drive through leading the team out onto the field. The ACC forced an end to this tradition after the 1980 season. The RAT cap tradition is most strictly observed by members of the marching band. Marching Band - Even though Georgia Tech is a high-ranking Institute of Technology, and not a college of the arts and humanities, it still fields a 300+ member marching band at all home football games and Bowl Games. A smaller Pep Band attends road games which the full band doesn\\'t attend. Among other songs, the Yellow Jacket Marching Band always plays the Georgia Tech fight songs and the Alma Mater, and in addition, it plays \"When You Say Budweiser, You\\'ve Said It All\" at the completion of the third quarter. == Individual achievements == === Heisman Trophy finalists === Georgia Tech has had several players receive votes in the Heisman Trophy balloting. Eddie Prokop finished fifth in the 1943 Heisman voting, Lenny Snow was fourteenth in 1966, Eddie Lee Ivery was eighth in 1978, and Calvin Johnson was tenth in 2006. Billy Lothridge is the only Tech player to receive votes in multiple years. He was eighth in 1962 and runner-up in 1963. Clint Castleberry was the only freshman in the history of the Heisman to finish as high as third until Herschel Walker\\'s third-place finish in 1980. Castleberry and Walker, however, were both surpassed in 2004 by true freshman Adrian Peterson\\'s Heisman runner-up season. Joe Hamilton tied Lothridge\\'s runner-up status in 1999. === All-Americans === Georgia Tech has fielded 50 First Team All-Americans. The first All-Americans at Tech were Walker Carpenter and Everett Strupper in 1917 while the most recent were Durant Brooks in 2007, Michael Johnson in 2008, Derrick Morgan in 2009, and Shaquille Mason in 2014. === Position award winners === Four Georgia Tech players have been awarded the highest collegiate award possible for their position. Joe Hamilton won the Davey O\\'Brien Award after his senior season in 1999, Calvin Johnson won the Fred Biletnikoff Award after his junior season in 2006, and Durant Brooks and Pressley Harvin III won the Ray Guy Award in 2007 and 2020 respectively. Hamilton and Johnson were the only Tech players to be named ACC Player of the Year until Jonathan Dwyer received the honor in 2008. === Post-collegiate accolades === ==== College Football Hall of Fame ==== Georgia Tech has had three coaches and 14 players inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame just down the street in Atlanta. Coaches Heisman, Alexander, and Dodd were inducted in the 1954, 1951, and 1993 classes respectively. ==== NFL Draft ==== Georgia Tech has over 150 alumni that have played in the National Football League. Tech has had ten players selected in the first round of the NFL draft since its inception in 1937. The first Georgia Tech player ever to be drafted was Middleton Fitzsimmons in 1937. He was drafted 2nd in the 10th round by the Chicago Bears. The first Tech player selected in the first round was Eddie Prokop in 1945 and the most recent first round Yellow Jackets were Demaryius Thomas and Derrick Morgan in 2010. First round draft picks ==== Pro Football Hall of Fame ==== Three Yellow Jackets have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Joe Guyon played professional football from 1920 to 1927. Guyon was a collegiate teammate of Jim Thorpe at Carlisle Indian Industrial School before transferring to Georgia Tech. His playing career began with the Canton Bulldogs and finished with the New York Giants. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in the class of 1966. Billy Shaw played professional football for the Buffalo Bills from 1961 to 1969. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in the class of 1999. Calvin Johnson played for the Detroit Lions from 2007 to 2015. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in the class of 2021, his first year of eligibility. == Future opponents == Announced schedules as of February 4, 2021. As a member of the ACC Coastal Division, Georgia Tech plays two games against a team from the ACC Atlantic Division every year. Clemson is their permanent cross-divisional rival and is played every year, while the other team rotates among the other six Atlantic teams. == Notes == == References == == Bibliography == McMath, Robert C.; Bayor, Ronald H.; Brittain, James E.; Foster, Lawrence; Giebelhaus, August W.; Reed, Germaine M.

The act of authorized one judgeship for the court. The district court in Ohio, not being assigned to a judicial circuit, was granted the same jurisdiction as U.S. circuit courts, except in appeals and writs of error, which were the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. By the act of February 24, 1807, 2 Stat. 420, the authority of the Ohio district court to exercise the jurisdiction of a U.S. circuit court was repealed, and Ohio was assigned to the newly organized Seventh Circuit. It also provided for a U.S. circuit court for the District of Ohio. The District was subdivided into Northern and Southern Districts on February 10, 1855, by 10 Stat. 604. The district judge serving the District of Ohio, Humphrey H. Leavitt, was reassigned to the Southern District of Ohio. On July 23, 1866, by 14 Stat. 209, Congress reorganized the circuits and assigned Ohio to the Sixth Circuit. Additional judgeships were created in 1910, 1937, 1966, 1970, 1978, 1984, and 1990. == Current judges == As of December 16, 2022: == Former judges == == Chief judges == Chief judges have administrative responsibilities with respect to their district court. Unlike the Supreme Court, where one justice is specifically nominated to be chief, the office of chief judge rotates among the district court judges. To be chief, a judge must have been in active service on the court for at least one year, be under the age of 65, and have not previously served as chief judge. A vacancy is filled by the judge highest in seniority among the group of qualified judges. The chief judge serves for a term of seven years or until age 70, whichever occurs first. The age restrictions are waived if no members of the court would otherwise be qualified for the position. When the office was created in 1948, the chief judge was the longest-serving judge who had not elected to retire on what has since 1958 been known as senior status or declined to serve as chief judge. After August 6, 1959, judges could not become or remain chief after turning 70 years old.

              " 'ʼuʼ ([ʔuʔ], beginning and ending with a glottal stop) is the first opera in the Klingon language, billed as \"The first authentic Klingon opera on Earth\". It was composed by Eef van Breen to a libretto by Kees Ligtelijn and Marc Okrand under the artistic direction of Floris Schönfeld. The story of ʼuʼ is based on the epic legend of \"Kahless the Unforgettable\", a messianic figure in the history of the fictional Klingon species. The premiere of the opera in The Hague on 10 September 2010 was a success, and the opera has been revived since then. == Background == The Klingon language was first conceived by actor James Doohan, who played Montgomery Scott (\"Scotty\") in the original Star Trek television series, for Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979). He created some harsh-sounding words to be spoken by Klingon characters. The producers hired linguist Marc Okrand for the sequels to expand this into a full-fledged language with its own unique vocabulary, grammar, and idioms. Okrand designed the language to sound \"alien\", using a number of typologically uncommon features. As Klingon characters became more important in later Star Trek films and television series, Okrand continued to expand the language, and it has become a spoken language with a number of fluent speakers. As depicted in Star Trek, the Klingons are passionate opera lovers. According to the official webpage for the opera, \"Klingon opera uses the principle of musical combat. Beauty in Klingon music comes from the impact of two opposing forces.\" ʼuʼ is translated to English as \"universe\" or \"universal\".The opera was workshopped beginning 2008 in Europe and at the Watermill Center for the Performing Arts in Water Mill, New York. Artistic and stage director and \"head researcher\" of the ʼuʼ project and the Klingon Terran Research Ensemble (KTRE), Floris Schönfeld, carefully researched all mentions and examples of Klingon opera in the various incarnations of Star Trek in order to make the opera as \"authentic\" as possible in following the conventions of Klingon battle opera. He created an \"ancient treatise\" called the paqʼjachchuʼ, or \"book of the perfect scream\", as a \"theory manuscript of Klingon music\". KTRE crafted \"indigenous\" Klingon musical instruments, including percussion, wind and strings, designed by Xavier van Wersch, to accompany the opera.Publicity for ʼuʼ included lectures and performances by Schönfeld and KTRE at SF conventions and elsewhere. On 18 April 2010, Okrand, on behalf of the KTRE, broadcast a message from the CAMRAS radio telescope to the hypothetical co-ordinates of QoʼnoS, the Klingon home planet, in the Arcturus solar system. The message, in the Klingon language, invited the Klingons to attend the opera, although the message presumably did not reach the planet in time for the performance, since QoʼnoS is 36 light years from Earth. == Productions and reaction == The opera had its official debut at the Zeebelt Theater in The Hague, Netherlands, on 10 September 2010 (following a preview the day before) for a four-performance limited run. The Dutch artist Henri van Zanten narrated the opera as the Master of the Scream. The opera was produced by Zeebelt and KTRE, which is associated with the ArtScience department of the Royal Conservatory in The Hague.Audience reaction after the preview was enthusiastic, and the opening night, which was attended by Marc Okrand, sold out. The director of the Byrd Hoffman Watermill Foundation commented, \"I found the result quite fascinating and interesting and strange and weird.\" The opera was repeated later in September 2010 at the Star Trek fanclub meeting Qetlop in Farnsberg, near Bad Brückenau, Germany, \"for an all-Klingon audience\". It was performed again on 23 and 24 November at the Frascati Theater in Amsterdam. In 2011 the opera was performed at the Voi-Z opera festival in Zwolle on 5 April and at the Huygens Music Festival in Leidschendam on 28 May.Performances of ʼuʼ were held in the Zeebelt Theatre in The Hague on 17 February 2012 and in Rijeka, Croatia, on 25 February 2012. The opera was performed in Berlin on 22 February 2013. == Synopsis == === Act 1 – yav === While hunting with his brother Morath, Kahless expresses anger when Morath causes him to miss his prey. Kahless vows to avenge this humiliation. The tyrant Molor offers to elevate Morath to the head of his house if he betrays his and Kahless\\'s father. Morath accepts. With Molor\\'s men, Morath enters his father\\'s house, seizes his sword and demands that his father surrender the house. When his father refuses, Morath brutally slays his father. Kahless vows to restore their father\\'s honor. He pursues Morath to the Kri\\'stak volcano. After the brothers fight, Morath throws himself into the volcano. Kahless forges the first bat\\'leth (or \"Sword of Honor\") in the volcano, from his own hair. === Act 2 – raD === The sorrowful Kahless makes an epic journey to the underworld. There he is united with his father and forgives his brother. He shows them the mok\\'bara, enabling them to regain their bodies. Kortar, the guardian of the underworld, is enraged to find two of his souls missing. Kahless raises troops for a rebellion against Molor. He meets his true love, the Lady Lukara, who assists him when he is attacked by Molor\\'s men. Together, they defeat Molor\\'s men and make violent love in the blood of their enemies. === Act 3 – QIH === At the river, the armies have assembled. Kahless inspires his troops with a rousing speech. Kortar arrives and is also stirred by Kahless\\'s honorable motives. He agrees to join the fight and to create a heaven for the Klingon warriors. Kahless, his father and brother fight together against their enemies. The latter two are honorably killed, and Kahless\\'s death scream sends them to heaven.

              " 'Cîteaux Abbey (French: Abbaye de Cîteaux [abe.i d(ə) sito]) is a Catholic abbey located in Saint-Nicolas-lès-Cîteaux, south of Dijon, France. It is notable for being the original house of the Cistercian order. Today, it belongs to the Trappists (also called the Cistercians of the Strict Observance). The abbey has about 35 members. The monks produce a cheese branded under the abbey\\'s name, as well as caramels and honey-based candies. == History == Cîteaux Abbey was founded on Saint Benedict\\'s Day, 21 March 1098, by a group of monks from Molesme Abbey seeking to follow more closely the Rule of St. Benedict. The Abbey was supported by Renaud, Vicomte de Beaune, and Odo I, Duke of Burgundy. They were led by Saint Robert of Molesme, who became the first abbot. The site was wooded and swampy, in a sparsely populated area. The toponym predates the abbey, but its origin is uncertain. Theories include a derivation from cis tertium [lapidem miliarium], \"this side of the third [milestone]\" of the Roman road connecting Langres and Chalons sur Saône, or alternatively from cisternae \"cisterns\", which in Middle Latin could refer to stagnant pools of a swamp.The monastery produced the illuminated manuscript now known as the Cîteaux Moralia in Job in the year 1111.The second abbot was Saint Alberic, and the third abbot Saint Stephen Harding, who wrote the Carta Caritatis that described the organisation of the order. Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, who would later be proclaimed Doctor of the Church, was a monk of Cîteaux Abbey and left it in 1115 to found Clairvaux Abbey, of which he was the first abbot. Saint Bernard would also be influential in the subsequent rapid growth of the Cistercian order. The great church of Cîteaux Abbey, begun in around 1140, was completed in 1193. The Dukes of Burgundy subsequently used it as their dynastic place of burial. By the beginning of the 13th century the order had more than 500 houses. Cîteaux was then an important center of Christianity. In 1244, King Louis IX of France (Saint Louis) and his mother Blanche of Castile visited the abbey. During the Hundred Years\\' War, the monastery was pillaged in 1360 (when the monks sought refuge in Dijon), 1365, 1434 and 1438. In 1380, the Earl of Buckingham stayed at L\\'Aumône Abbey, a daughter house of Cîteaux located in the forest of Marchenoir whilst his army was quartered in the surrounding Forest.In the beginning of the 16th century, the abbey was a strong community of about 200 members. The abbey was badly hit by the French Wars of Religion. The abbey then slowly declined for the next century. In 1698, the abbey only had 72 professed monks. In 1791, during the French Revolution, the abbey was seized and sold by the government. In 1898, the remains of the abbey were bought back and repopulated by Trappists. == List of abbots == == References == == Sources == Plouvier, M. and Saint-Denis, A.

              " 'In Major League Baseball, the Manager of the Year Award is an honor given annually since 1983 to two outstanding managers, one each in the American League (AL) and the National League (NL). The winner is voted on by 30 members of the Baseball Writers\\' Association of America (BBWAA). Each submits a vote for first, second, and third place among the managers of each league. The manager with the highest score in each league wins the award.Several managers have won the award in a season in which they led their team to 100 or more wins. They are: Lou Piniella – 116 (Seattle Mariners, 2001) Joe Torre – 114 (New York Yankees, 1998) Gabe Kapler – 107 (San Francisco Giants, 2021) Sparky Anderson – 104 (Detroit Tigers, 1984) Tony La Russa – 104 (Oakland Athletics, 1988) Dusty Baker – 103 (San Francisco Giants, 1993) Larry Dierker – 102 (Houston Astros, 1998) Whitey Herzog – 101 (St. Louis Cardinals, 1985) Rocco Baldelli – 101 (Minnesota Twins, 2019) Buck Showalter – 101 (New York Mets, 2022) Kevin Cash – 100 (Tampa Bay Rays, 2021)In 1991, Bobby Cox became the first manager to win the award in both leagues, winning with the Atlanta Braves and having previously won with the Toronto Blue Jays in 1985. La Russa, Piniella, Showalter, Jim Leyland, Bob Melvin, Davey Johnson, and Joe Maddon have since won the award in both leagues. Cox, La Russa, and Showalter have won the most awards, with four. Baker, Leyland, Piniella, Maddon, Melvin, and Terry Francona have won three times. In 2005, Cox became the first manager to win the award in consecutive years. Cash became the second manager in 2021, and first in the AL, to win the award in consecutive years. Terry Francona and Buck Showalter are the most recent winners. Because of the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike cut the season short and canceled the post-season, the BBWAA writers effectively created a de facto mythical national championship (similar to college football) by naming managers of the unofficial league champions (lead the leagues in winning percentage) (Buck Showalter and Felipe Alou) as Managers of the Year. The Chicago White Sox have seen five managers win the award, most in the majors, while one franchise, the Milwaukee Brewers, has not had a manager win the award. Only five managers have won the award while leading a team that finished outside the top two spots in its division. Buck Rodgers was the first, winning the award in 1987 with the third-place Expos. Tony Peña and Showalter won the award with third-place teams in back-to-back years: Peña with the Royals in 2003, and Showalter with the Rangers in 2004. Joe Girardi is the only manager to win the award with a fourth-place team (2006 Florida Marlins); he is also the only manager to win the award after fielding a team with a losing record. == Key == == Winners == === American League === === National League === == Notes == a The formula used to calculate the final scores is Score = 5F + 3S + T, where F is the number of first-place votes, S is second -place votes, and T is third-place votes. b The 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike ended the season on August 11, as well as cancelling the entire postseason, with writers effectively turning the vote into a de facto mythical national championship, similar to college football. c Johnny Oates and Joe Torre tied for the lead among voters in the American League in 1996. d Teams played a truncated 60-game season in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. == See also == \"Esurance MLB Awards\" Best Manager (in MLB) Baseball America Manager of the Year Baseball Prospectus Internet Baseball Awards Manager of the Year Chuck Tanner Major League Baseball Manager of the Year Award Associated Press Manager of the Year (discontinued in 2001) Honor Rolls of Baseball #Managers MLB All-Time Manager (1997; BBWAA) Sporting News Manager of the Decade (2009) Sports Illustrated MLB Manager of the Decade (2009) Major League Baseball all-time managerial wins Best Coach/Manager ESPY Award (all sports) == References == General\"Manager of the Year Award Winners\".

She finished second behind Medvedeva and 0.83 ahead of compatriot Wakaba Higuchi while Team Japan won the gold medal. === 2017–2018 season: Four Continents silver === Mihara won silver at the 2017 CS Autumn Classic International. She placed fourth at both of her Grand Prix assignments, 2017 Cup of China and 2017 Internationaux de France.After a fifth-place finish at the 2017-18 Japan Figure Skating Championships she was assigned to the 2018 Four Continents Championships. At the championships, she was third in the short program behind countrywomen Satoko Miyahara and Kaori Sakamoto. After a second-place finish in the free skate and mistakes from Miyahara, Mihara rose to second place overall. === 2018–2019 season: Winter Universiade champion === Mihara won silver at the 2018 CS Nebelhorn Trophy. In the Grand Prix, she first competed at the 2018 NHK Trophy, the most hotly-contested ladies\\' event on the Grand Prix that year. She was third in the short program but dropped to fourth in the free skate and overall despite making only one error, a jump under rotation. She then narrowly placed second at the 2018 Internationaux de France, slightly behind compatriot Rika Kihira. Mihara said she was unsatisfied with her free skate in France but that \"overall, it was a good experience for me, and I will continue to practice to gain more confidence.\"At the 2018 Japan Championships, Mihara placed third in both programs, finishing fourth overall. She was again assigned to the Japanese team for the Four Continents Championships. Competing at Four Continents, she underrotated her opening combination jump to place eighth in the short program. She described this as an error she would not normally make, even in practice. Mihara then placed second in the free skate, winning the bronze medal overall, her third consecutive Four Continents podium finish. Mihara concluded her season at the 2019 Winter Universiade, where she won the ladies singles\\' title. === 2019–2020 season: Hiatus === Poor health forced Mihara to withdraw from both of her Grand Prix assignments, the 2019 Skate Canada International and 2019 Cup of China. She would not compete for the remainder of the season. Her longtime training mate and friend Kaori Sakamoto would subsequently feel that Mihara\\'s absence from the rink contributed to Sakamoto\\'s lackluster results. === 2020–2021 season: Return to competition === Mihara returned to competition domestically, winning the bronze medal at the Kinki Regional Championships and then silver at the Western Sectionals. With the COVID-19 pandemic affecting international travel, the ISU designed the Grand Prix primarily based on geographic location, and Mihara was one of eleven Japanese skaters assigned to the 2020 NHK Trophy alongside South Korean You Young. She placed seventh in the short program. Mihara was third in the free skate, rising to fourth place overall, slightly more than four points behind bronze medalist Rino Matsuike. Addressing her return to competition post-illness, she said, \"the crowd welcomed me back, and I can\\'t thank them enough.\"Competing at the 2020–21 Japan Championships, Mihara was third in the short program with a clean skate. In the free skate, she doubled a planned triple Lutz and ranked seventh in that segment, dropping to fifth place overall. === 2021–2022 season: Four Continents champion === Beginning the season at the Olympic test event, the 2021 CS Asian Open Trophy, Mihara won the gold medal. She was initially assigned to only one Grand Prix event, the 2021 Cup of China, which was subsequently replaced by the 2021 Gran Premio d\\'Italia. Upon Rika Kihira\\'s withdrawal from the 2021 Skate Canada International due to ankle injury, Mihara was named to replace her. Mihara was seventh in the short program at Skate Canada International despite a clean skate but rose to fourth overall with a third-place free skate. She finished 4.53 points behind bronze medalist Alena Kostornaia, with new personal bests in the free skate and total score. Competing in Italy the following week, she again placed fourth, setting new personal bests in the free skate and total score. Speaking afterward, Mihara said she hoped to regain more power and speed.At the 2021–22 Japan Championships, the final national qualification event for the 2022 Winter Olympics, Mihara placed fifth in the short program. She was fifth as well in the free skate segment, making a notable error by performing only a single Axel instead of a planned double in combination with a triple toe loop. She finished fourth overall, less than four points behind bronze medalist Mana Kawabe. She was named as an alternate for the Japanese Olympic team and assigned to compete at the 2022 Four Continents Championships. Mihara won both segments of the competition to take her second Four Continents gold, as well as a fourth medal at the event overall. She reflected on her comeback to the sport, saying, \"I was well supported, surrounded by very warm people, and it showed me how lucky I am. I was happy to come back.\" === 2022–2023 season: Grand Prix Final champion === Mihara began the season on the Grand Prix at the 2022 MK John Wilson Trophy in Sheffield. Despite an error on the triple flip, she won the short program, finishing 0.17 points ahead of American skater Isabeau Levito. She won the free program by a wider margin after a clean skate, taking her first Grand Prix gold medal. Mihara reflected that her win at the event was \"maybe the biggest happiness it gave to me\". Her second assignment, the 2022 Grand Prix of Espoo, was widely regarded as a contest between her and Belgium\\'s Loena Hendrickx, the reigning World silver medalist who had earlier won the 2022 Grand Prix de France. Mihara placed second in the short program, 1.30 points behind Hendrickx. Both she and Hendrickx made errors in the free skate segment, but Mihara took first overall, earning her second gold medal and qualifying to the Grand Prix Final for the first time in her career. She cited \"a lot of regrets\" about the free skate but said she was \"happy to go to the Grand Prix Final.\"With the Final being held in Turin, Mihara was able to train with longtime friend and fellow qualifier Kaori Sakamoto in the leadup, having not been able to train together for \"such a long time.\" Mihara said she found it \"very gratifying.\" She finished second in the short program, 1.28 points behind Sakamoto and only 0.34 points ahead of third-place Hendrickx. Her score was a new personal best in the segment of 74.58. Mihara went on to finish first in what the ISU itself characterized as a \"turbulent\" free skate segment, despite underrotating one jump and falling out of another, while frontrunner Sakamoto dropped off the podium entirely. Mihara called the result \"unbelievable.\" The Olympic Channel concluded, \"Mihara Mai is having the season of her dreams.\"Following her victory at the Final, Mihara entered the 2022–23 Japan Championships as a title contender. She finished second in the short program with a 74.70 score, 3.09 points behind Sakamoto, after the second part of her jump combination was called underrotated. She was second in the free skate as well, albeit 10.03 points behind Sakamoto, winning the silver medal and standing on the Japanese national podium for the first time in six years.Competing at her second Winter World University Games (formerly Universiade), this time held in Lake Placid, Mihara finished second in the short program behind Sakamoto. She won the free skate, taking the gold medal for a second time. She was on the third woman to win the event twice, after Miwa Fukuhara and Tonia Kwiatkowski. Mihara next appeared at the International Challenge Cup at the end of February, winning the silver medal. Sakamoto and Mana Kawabe joined her on the podium in a Japanese sweep of the medals. She noted that she had missed some training recently as a result of influenza. == Programs == == Competitive highlights == GP: Grand Prix; CS: Challenger Series; JGP: Junior Grand Prix == Detailed results == === Senior level === Small medals for short and free programs awarded only at ISU Championships.

              " \"The packer's knot is a binding knot which is easily pulled taut and quickly locked in position. It is most often made in small line or string, such as that used for hand baling, parcel tying, and binding roasts. This latter use, and its general form, make it a member of a class of similar knots known as butcher's knots. == Tying and variations == A lightly tightened figure-eight knot is formed around the standing part of the line such that both ends emerge from the same point. Pulling on the standing part tightens the binding. After the desired degree of tension is reached, a locking half-hitch is added over the working end and pulled taut. Even without the locking half-hitch the knot will generally maintain tension while additional tying is accomplished, such as putting a second, perpendicular, wrap on a package.A similar knot made with an overhand knot instead of a figure-eight works almost as well. Many other variations also exist finishing with this style of locking half-hitch. In fact, Clifford Ashley claimed that there were more knots of this type to be found than any other used for a single purpose. == See also == Corned beef knot List of binding knots List of knots == References == == External links == Diagram of a packer's knot\",\n",

              " 'An impromptu (, French: [ɛ̃pʁɔ̃pty], loosely meaning \"offhand\") is a free-form musical composition with the character of an ex tempore improvisation as if prompted by the spirit of the moment, usually for a solo instrument, such as piano. According to Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung, Johann Baptist Cramer began publishing piano pieces under the (sub-)title of \"impromptu.\" (AMZ, Mar. No II, 1815, col. 6), which seems to be the first recorded use of the term impromptu in this sense. == Form usage == Since the very concept of unpremeditated, spur-of-the-moment inspiration without studied care is at the heart of Romantic artistic theory, it did not take long before the first generation of Romantic composers took up the idea. Others were: Frédéric Chopin composed 4 Impromptus, including the famous Fantaisie-Impromptu. Jan Václav Voříšek was the first one to compose impromptus published under that title, in 1822. Franz Schubert published two sets of four Impromptus for piano op. 90 and 142 (1827). After his death 3 more unnamed piano compositions (Klavierstücke) were sometimes named Impromptus. Robert Schumann wrote some Impromptus, published as Op. 5. Franz Liszt composed an Impromptu in F sharp (sometimes called Nocturne) and a piano piece named Valse-Impromptu. Alexander Scriabin is known to have written at least nine impromptus for the piano in his early period. Jean Sibelius composed six impromptus for piano op. 5 (1893)The impromptu genre remained popular all throughout the 19th century and was prominent throughout the romantic era. In the 20th century, there are also several examples of composers naming their compositions \"Impromptu\", such as: Gabriel Fauré composing six Impromptus between 1881 and 1913. Richard Rodney Bennett composing five Impromptus for guitar in 1968 Maurice Journeau composing six Impromptus between 1971 and 1974. Donald Martino composing Fantasies and Impromptu in 1980. Nikolai Kapustin composing four Impromptus between 1991 and 1997. Lowell Liebermann composing Three Impromptus Op.68 in 2000 and Two Impromptus Op.131 in 2016. Vince Mendoza\\'s Epiphany, performed by the London Symphony Orchestra and published in 1999. The first piece of the album is named Impromptu.

              " \"The Eagle Aircraft 150 is an Australian designed two-seat single-engine composite material training, touring and sport aircraft. It utilizes a three lifting surface design consisting of a forward wing (foreplane), main wing (mainplane) and horizontal stabilizer (tailplane). The aircraft was designed and originally built by Eagle Aircraft Pty Ltd, but is now manufactured in Malaysia by Composites Technology Research Malaysia (CTRM). == Design and development == The Eagle 150B is a development of the Eagle X-TS from Western Australian inventors Neil Graham and his father Deryck Graham. Australian aeronautical engineer Graham Swannell and American aerodynamicist John Roncz were then engaged to design an aircraft to meet then-current JAR VLA requirements and demonstrate minimal stall characteristics. The resulting prototype (designated Eagle 150A) was first flown in March 1988, and was certified in November 1996. The aircraft demonstrated docile stall characteristics, rapid roll rates, 125 knot cruise speed (at 75% power) and crisp handling. After 15 aircraft were built at Fremantle, Western Australia, the Eagle 150B was introduced. Roncz was presented with the Prince's Australian Medal for the design of the Eagle 150 by His Royal Highness Prince Philip at a London ceremony in 2000.The manufacturing rights to the Eagle 150B are now owned by the Malaysian company Composites Technology Research Malaysia (CTRM). == Eagle Airborne Reconnaissance Vehicle == A development of the aircraft as an unmanned aerial vehicle has been designated the Eagle ARV System. The first system, consisting of three aircraft and a ground station, has been purchased by the Malaysian government and other 20 on order. The unmanned or manned version of 150 is being used by the Royal Malaysian Air Force for aerial surveillance operations for environmental and fire control. Specifications are identical to the Eagle 150 other than the ability for the aircraft to be remotely flown. == Variants == Eagle X-TS Initial design by Neil Graham and his father Deryck Graham.

On stage, he usually wears a pink vest and white pants. Aside from comedy, he is also known for his participation in sporting events such as kickboxing, bodybuilding, and finswimming. He was also a YouTuber under the name Hideo Furui. == Biography == 1979 - Born in Tokorozawa, Saitama 1991 - Graduated from Meiho Elementary School, Tokorozawa, Saitama 1993 - Met Wakabayashi as a classmate 1994 - Graduated from Nihon University Dai-ni Junior High School in Tokyo 1997 - Graduated from Nihon University Dai-ni High School in Tokyo 1997 - Entered Nihon University majoring in commerce in Tokyo 2000 - Formed owari duo \"Nice Middle\" with Wakabayashi 2000 - Took a year off from Nihon University 2001 - Returned to Nihon University 2002 - Graduated from Nihon University 2005 - Changed the duo\\'s name to \"Audrey\", taken from Audrey Hepburn 2007 - Defeated by Wang HongXiang at K-1 Tryout 2008 - Won 2nd place at Autobacs M-1 Grand Prix 2008 2009 - Won 1st place at Shinshun Owarai Taisho - New wave awards (won 76,009 votes out of total 212,036 from TV audiences) == Early life == Kasuga learned swimming from his early childhood through his junior high school years. He attended a private junior high school in Tokyo, Nihon University Dai-ni Junior High, and met Wakabayashi there when they were 8th graders. Wakabayashi, a trouble-making kid sitting just behind Kasuga, played with him, sneakily cutting his hair from behind without telling him. In spite of Wakabayashi\\'s misbehavior, Kasusga\\'s first impression on Wakabayashi was that he was a \"cute boy\", and they got along. They also attended the same high school, Nihon University Dai-ni High School and joined the American Football Club. Kasuga was chosen as a member of the Kanto\\'s all-star American Football Team as a defensive end. However, a penny-pincher, Kasuga did not want to buy outdoor shoes for astro turf that players were suggested to wear for the all-star game, and improperly wearing indoor shoes, was replaced soon after the game had started.After his high school years, Wakabayashi invited Kasuga to be his manzai partner. However, Kasuga decided to attend Nihon University instead. He spent his university years by taking part-time jobs such as a sales clerk position at Seibu Dome. He mentioned that one day a Glay concert was held there while he was working, and he was very moved after ten years when he was invited to Glay vocalist Teru\\'s birthday party as his favorite aspiring comedian.Attending mass communication seminars, Kasuga initially planned to be a TV producer while Wakabayashi kept inviting Kasuga to start a comedy career. Finally Kasuga accepted his offer, and they formed a comedy duo, \"Nice Middle\", in 2000. == Career == === Dark days to M-1 Grand Prix 2008 === Although they happily jumped into a comedy career, they stayed unsuccessful for several years. One day, six years since their debut, a TV play writer called Wakabayashi in person and told him \"Kasuga has no talent as a tsukkomi. If you want to play a boke, you\\'d better look for another partner.\" Wakabayashi, then the boke of the duo, relayed the comment to the then tsukkomi Kasuga, but he initially thought Wakabashi was just joking around and did not believe him at all. They eventually swapped their roles, went through a trial-and-error process, and finally they made the first appearance on terrestrial TV on New Year\\'s Day of 2008. On December 21, 2008, the two made it all the way into the final round of the M-1 Grand Prix of the year from the consolation match. During the first session in the final, they were temporarily in the top position above the other eight duos, but eventually ended up 2nd behind Non Style. === Rise to popularity === Shaving his sideburns (a hair style called a \"techno-cut\"), wearing his hair parted \"80/20\" (80% of the hair is combed to the right and the rest to the left) and a pink sweater vest, Kasuga, a unique arrogant character, has been broadly accepted by audiences since the M-1 Grand Prix. In October 2009, Kasuga was chosen with Wakabayashi as a new regular member for \"Waratte Iitomo\", the nation\\'s most popular afternoon TV show, and a radio personality for \"All Night Nippon\", one of the longest-running radio programs in Japan. === Character on stage === Kasuga walks heavily and slowly with his proud 101 cm chest expanding toward the center of the stage. At the opening, he drops a bossy comment to female audiences such as \"Would you like to deliver Kasuga\\'s baby?\" In manzai, he tries to shoot tsukkomi and each time it turns out to be terribly off-the-line boke. Also, he interrupts Wakabayashi\\'s talks with delayed responses and frequent gags. In manzai and talk, he responds back saying \"Oui\" (\"Yes\"). Holding up his index finger, he yells \"Toos!\" meaning \"Hey!\" or \"I did it!\" Some of his other recurring gags include \"Onigawara\", \"Apa\" and the \"Kasu\" dance. === Penny pincher === His stingy life style has been introduced in many variety shows. He says that he wants to save as much money as possible to buy a single-family home in the future. === Other ventures === Kasuga participated in K-1 kickboxing in 2007. He retired after two fighting matches due to ruptured eardrum.Kasuga has represented Japan at the Finswimming Master World Cup, organized by the Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques. He won a bronze medal at the 2015 event in Ravenna, Italy and a silver medal at the 2016 event in Prague, Czech Republic.Kasuga started bodybuilding in 2013 and placed fifth at the 23rd Tokyo Bodybuilding Tournament in 2015. He did not qualify at the 24th event in 2016.Kasuga ran a YouTube channel under the name Hideo Furui, which was discontinued in December 2021. == Personal life == He is described as reserved, polite and modest, contrary to his character on TV. Wakabayashi has said he has never heard Kasuga speaking bad about others. Mikio Date, a member of owarai duo Sandwichman has also said Kasuga had neither spoken ill of others nor agreed with other comedians\\' bad comments on others at their joint live rehearsals.His father has been very supportive of his career, making original DVDs of Kasuga to distribute to the family\\'s neighbors, and frequently giving him advice by e-mail. Though initially against his comedy career, his mother is also supportive, distributing to neighbors the Playboy magazine when one of the issues carried an article on Kasuga. According to Kasuga, all of his family members are big-boned. His mother used to be a softball player. Kasuga had a fanatical female fan called \"Ochimusha\" (stray samurai) when he was a football player in high school. From the age of 20, he had a girlfriend (called \"Dogu\" (clay doll) by Wakabayashi) for five years. When he dated her, his friends called him \"Moai\" due to his big head, and named the two \"the mysterious couple.\" She later said on the TV program \"London Hearts\" that he was gentle, but she separated from him because she did not like his indecisiveness. On the show, unexpectedly meeting her at a bar, he got very nervous and passed her once but looked back at her repeatedly. (He just looked like he was \"spinning around.\")On his birthday, February 9, 2009, he was photographed by a paparazzo during the night while he was dating a 30-year-old woman who, according to Wakabayashi, resembles the \"Hippo of Isodin.\" (One of Japanese confectionery/pharmaceutical company Meiji Seika\\'s anime characters. See the \"External Links\" section below). Kasuga later said that he was going to make her his girlfriend, but after the photo\\'s publication, he was unsuccessful in reaching her.In April, 2019, Kasuga proposed to his girlfriend of 11 years \"Kumi-san\" on the television variety Monitoring. == Media == === TV === Campus Night Fuji (キャンパスナイト･フジ) -- Fuji Television/CX (4/10/2009-) School Kakumei (スクール革命!) -- Nippon Television (4/5/2009-) Merengue no Kimochi (メレンゲの気持ち) -- Nippon Television (4/25/2009-) *Every three weeks Zenbu Uso (ぜんぶウソ) -- Nippon Television (10/3/2009-) Morita Kazuyoshi Hour Waratte Iitomo!

              " 'James Calvin Wilsey (July 12, 1957 – December 24, 2018) was an American musician. He played bass with San Francisco punk band the Avengers, but became better known as the lead guitarist for Chris Isaak\\'s band Silvertone. He featured on Isaak\\'s albums Silvertone, Chris Isaak, Heart Shaped World, and San Francisco Days, and is widely remembered for his distinctive guitar tone and technique, being dubbed the \"King of Slow\" by fans. After leaving Isaak\\'s band, Wilsey pursued various solo projects while struggling with drug addiction and, toward the end of his life, periods of homelessness. He died from multiple organ failure related to hepatitis and drug use. == Musical style == Wilsey\\'s 1965 Fender Stratocaster and use of reverb, delay and gentle vibrato gave a distinctive sound to Isaak hits such as \"Wicked Game\" (the opening two-note riff, in his own words, \"crystallizes Wilsey\\'s approach\") and \"Blue Hotel\". Producer Erik Jacobsen remarked, \"In terms of the feeling Jimmy was able to put into a song with the wang bar and the tremolo and effects — Jimmy had a really magical touch...\" == Career == In 1977, Wilsey joined the Avengers, a pioneering band in the San Francisco punk rock scene. The band notably opened for the Sex Pistols at the Winterland Ballroom in January 1978, which led to Pistols guitarist Steve Jones sponsoring their recording career. Though the Avengers only released two EPs and a few compilation tracks during their initial run, the band influenced later San Francisco bands such as Dead Kennedys and Flipper, with Dead Kennedys bassist Klaus Fluoride praising Wilsey\\'s use of octaves.Wilsey joined Chris Isaak\\'s band Silvertone shortly after its formation in 1980. They initially played in many local San Francisco night clubs. Isaak recalled upon Wilsey\\'s death that \"Jimmy had so much heart and a great sound\". However, the two became estranged by the early 1990s due to Wilsey\\'s impatience with Isaak\\'s behavior and his own worsening drug problems.In 1998, Wilsey formed a short-lived instrumental band called the Mysteries. Dropping the moniker \"Calvin\", Wilsey released a solo album of guitar instrumentals in 2008, titled El Dorado, which paid homage to musical influences such as Duane Eddy, the Shadows, Billy Strange, James Burton and Link Wray. Wilsey\\'s last commercial recording under his own name was in 2012, when he contributed a cover of Johnny Cash\\'s \"The Man Comes Around\" to the soundtrack to the film Killing Them Softly. In 2017, he played guitar on Miss Derringer\\'s cover of \"Unchained Melody\". == Personal life and death == In the 1990s, Wilsey met fashion boutique owner and designer Winter Mullender. They married in 2003 and had a son, Waylon. They divorced in 2008. Wilsey\\'s health declined and in 2013 he developed hepatitis C and cirrhosis of the liver. His drug use reportedly continued during this time. He reconnected and temporarily cohabited with Mullender, but they were evicted in 2018 and became homeless. Wilsey was taken to LAC+USC Medical Center in December of that year with the onset of organ failure, and died on the afternoon of Christmas Eve. == Selected discography == === Solo === El Dorado (2008) === With the Avengers === We Are the One EP (1977) Avengers EP (1979) Avengers (1983) Died for Your Sins (1999) Zero Hour (2003) The American in Me (2004) Live at Winterland 1978 (2010) === With Chris Isaak === Silvertone (1985) Chris Isaak (1986) Heart Shaped World (1989) San Francisco Days (1993) == References == == External links == James Calvin Wilsey at AllMusic James Calvin Wilsey discography at Discogs James Calvin Wilsey at IMDb https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/195565825/james-calvin-wilsey',\n",

It reached Duluth in 1971, and the final segment to east Duluth opened in 1992. == Route description == I-35 enters the state from Iowa near Albert Lea. It heads roughly due north toward the Twin Cities, where it splits into I-35E and I-35W. The two halves of I-35 rejoin north of the Twin Cities. From there, I-35 travels north-northeast; south of Duluth, it becomes more northeasterly. The route ends near the shore of Lake Superior in Duluth. The entire route is officially designated the Red Bull Highway, named after the 34th Infantry (Red Bull) Division. Legally, I-35 is defined as Routes 390, 395, and 396 in the Minnesota Statutes §161.12(2), but the route is not marked with those numbers. The I-35 legislative route designation and mileposts follow I-35E in the Twin Cities area. === Southern segment === I-35 enters the state in Freeborn County south of Albert Lea. The first one mile (1.6 km) northbound contains a rest area and Minnesota welcome center. Shortly after the first exit, for County Road 5 (CR 5), there is a sweeping S-curve to the northwest and back to the north. The exit for CR 13 marks the last exit before Albert Lea. Up to here, the Interstate roughly marked the halfway point between U.S. Route 65 (US 65) and US 69. Both U.S. Highways end in Albert Lea. In Albert Lea, it curves to the northeast and meets US 65, which passes beneath the Interstate. US 65 picks up Business Loop Interstate 35 (BL I-35), which follows the US Highway through the city. It then crosses Albert Lea Lake of a pair of 0.25-mile-long (0.40 km) bridges. It straightens back to the north to meet CR 46, which follows the former route of US 16. Shortly after that interchange, it intersects the national northern end of US 65; access to US 65 there is limited to the southbound lanes of I-35, and traffic from US 65 can only access the northbound lanes of I-35. At the northeastern edge of Albert Lea, there is an interchange with I-90, which directs traffic toward La Crosse, Wisconsin, or Sioux Falls, South Dakota. I-35 continues north through the rolling hills of southern Minnesota. At Clarks Grove, it intersects MN 251. Between there and the CR 35 exit to Geneva, it passes to the west of Geneva Lake. Just east of Ellendale is an interchange with MN 30. Exit 32, CR 4 to Hope, is the last interchange before Owatonna. On the southern edge of Owatonna is a cloverleaf interchange with US 14. North of CR 45, the CR 34 exit serves northern Owatonna and provides access to the Owatonna Degner Regional Airport. The CR 9 exit serves Clinton Falls and a Cabela\\'s store. Further north, I-35 meets CR 12 and CR 23 in Medford. Along CR 23, which serves as a western frontage road to I-35, lies an outlet mall. Now in Rice County, the Interstate approaches Faribault. Exit 55 only serves exiting northbound traffic and entering southbound traffic. MN 60 is the main east–west street through Faribault, and MN 21 provides access to Faribault from the north of town. To the south, MN 21 ends at MN 60, but the road continues south and reconnects to I-35 at exit 55. North of Faribault, the Interstate heads due north before the two directions are briefly separated when they enter a corridor of trees. The route straightens out again and intersects CR 1 and MN 19 at diamond interchanges spaced three miles (4.8 km) apart. It briefly enters Scott County where it meets CR 2 near Elko New Market. It then enters Dakota County and the Minneapolis–St. Paul metropolitan area. In southwestern Lakeville, there is a folded diamond interchange with CR 70. Right before a partial cloverleaf interchange with CR 60, the Interstate crosses Marion Lake. Shortly after an interchange with CR 5 and CR 50, there is a park and ride complex on the northbound side of the Interstate. An entrance and exit ramp provide access to the Interstate while two entrances from Kendrick Avenue, a frontage road, provide non-Interstate access to the complex. After the CR 46 interchange, the Interstate enters Burnsville. A half diamond interchange, with only northbound exit and southbound entrance ramps, immediately precedes the split. I-35 splits into I-35W and I-35E (signed for Minneapolis and Saint Paul, respectively). === Northern segment === I-35W and I-35E join again at Columbus, near Forest Lake. The route then continues as I-35. In contrast to the rolling terrain of I-35 south of the Twin Cities area, this region is quite flat. This is the Anoka Sand Plain, an area that was formed by outwash under the last glaciers that lay over this area as they melted. This is an extensive region that continues north for another 20 miles (32 km). The urban sprawl of the northern Twin Cities continues along I-35 to North Branch. In Pine City and Hinckley, there are museums near I-35: the Pine City one at a refurbished fur trading post and interpretive center and the Hinckley one commemorating the Great Hinckley Forest Fire that occurred in 1894. Motorists who take BL I-35 through Pine City can experience a quintessential all-American main street. Between Sandstone and Moose Lake, the landscape around I-35 makes a dramatic change. Exposed granite can be seen at the surface, and the deciduous forest changes to evergreens. I-35 climbs Thompson Hill as it approaches the city of Duluth. As the highway enters the city limits at Boundary Avenue, the Saint Louis Bay and Lake Superior are in view. I-35 then descends Thompson Hill into Duluth, with numerous exits. The freeway has an interchange with I-535/US 53, known locally as the \"Can of Worms\". The junction features a pair of left exits from I-35, a stoplight, and lane drops over the I-35 bridge. I-35 then proceeds to downtown Duluth. After multiple exits, I-35 leaves the downtown area and follows the Lake Superior shoreline for two miles (3.2 km) to its national northern terminus at its junction with MN 61 and 26th Avenue East. At this junction where I-35 ends, MN 61 begins its route northeast along the North Shore of Lake Superior. == History == I-35 in Minnesota was authorized as part of the primary Interstate network in 1956. It was mostly constructed in the 1960s. The route in Minnesota replaced portions of old US 61 and old US 65. I-35 was generally constructed along former routes of US 65 south of the Twin Cities and US 61 north of the Twin Cities. The first section to be constructed (the first Interstate Highway opened in Minnesota) was about 10 miles (16 km) north of Owatonna, immediately west of present-day Steele CR 45 and Rice CR 45, which opened August 21, 1958. By 1961, the section of I-35 around Hinckley and Sandstone was under construction. Three lanes each way have been constructed on I-35 between the I-35E/I-35W split at Columbus to US 8 at Forest Lake. Three lanes have also been constructed on I-35 northbound at Thompson Hill, right before entering the city of Duluth. Additionally, three lanes have been constructed on I-35 southbound in Duluth at Thompson Hill between Central Avenue and US 2 westbound. Three lanes in each direction have also been constructed on I-35 in Duluth between the Can of Worms interchange (I-535/US 53) and the Mesaba Avenue interchange. From November 1971 to October 1987, the national northern terminus for I-35 was its interchange with Mesaba Avenue in Duluth. The last section of I-35 in Minnesota to be constructed was around downtown Duluth. The I-35 extension to Lake Avenue in Duluth was open to traffic in October 1987. The temporary I-35 extension to 10th Avenue East in Duluth was open to traffic in November 1989. The I-35 extension to its present-day junction with 26th Avenue East and MN 61 in Duluth was open to traffic in October 1992 after the construction of the Leif Erickson Tunnel. The section marked the final segment of the I-35 to be opened, and one of the last segments of the original Interstate Highway System.In 2002, all of I-35 in the state of Minnesota, from the Iowa state line to the city of Duluth, was officially designated the Red Bull Highway, after the 34th Infantry (Red Bull) Division, though plans to create signage never came to fruition. In practice, this name is seldom, if ever, used. == Exit list == == References == == External links == Interstate 35 at the Unofficial Minnesota Highways Page',\n",

The pageant is a pedestal for women who want to be the voice of celebrating beauty and harmony in diversity. May it be in the form of culture, race, belief, or opinion, we believe that all women are distinctly beautiful and one of a kind. Mission — Miss Asia Pacific International inspires women to be comfortable in their own skin and to believe that their individuality is one of the key qualities that make them distinctly beautiful. To provide opportunities for them to develop their skills, achieve their highest potential, and be the epitome of a strong, empowered. and confident woman. Vision — Miss Asia Pacific International is a platform for women to learn, improve, and ignite positive change within herself, and the global community. == History == The pageant was founded in 1965 as \"Miss Asia\" contest and the first titleholder was Angela Filmer from Malaysia. She was crowned by the wife of then President of the Philippines, Imelda Marcos on December 4, 1965. The contest had a humble beginning with only 18 countries participating in the first edition. The pageant was first only accepted contestants from Asia and Oceania countries to compete but the rules changed in 1985. The pageant\\'s title was changed to \"Miss Asia Pacific\" in 1984 then to \"Miss Asia Pacific Quest\" in 1985 after participants from countries in the Americas and the Pacific Ocean were allowed to compete. Since 2005, the pageant was again renamed to Miss Asia Pacific International and every countries from all over the world were allowed to participate in the competition. The pageant was not held in 1990 due to Luzon earthquake and in 1991 due to Mount Pinatubo eruption; also in 2004 and from 2006 to 2015.In 2005, winner Leonora Jimenez Monge from Costa Rica was dethroned after taking part in participating at Miss World contest. The first runner-up, Yevgeniya Lapova from Russia was given the crown and title. The pageant was then suspended after the conclusion of the 2005 edition. 12 years later in 2016, the pageant was revived and the winner was Tessa le Conge from the Netherlands.The most recent titleholder was Chaiyenne Huisman from Spain, who was crowned on 9 October 2019.Due to the restrictions brought about by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the organizers ceased to stage another competition since the last edition.

              " 'Jason Lee Von Flue (born August 1, 1975) is a former American mixed martial artist who appeared on the second season of The Ultimate Fighter. A professional competitor since 1999, he has competed for the UFC, WEC, Strikeforce and King of the Cage. In 2006, at UFC Ultimate Fight Night 3 against Alex Karalexis, Von Flue successfully applied a unique submission move to counter the guillotine choke that is now commonly referred to as the Von Flue choke. Additionally, since 2017, the \"Von Flue choke\" has occasionally been referred to as the \"Von Preux Choke\", due to its usage by Ovince Saint Preux. == Mixed martial arts career == === Early career === Von Flue made his professional MMA debut in June 1999, fighting and winning three times in one night on the International Fighting Championships WC 3: Warriors Challenge 3 show. Over the next six years, he amassed a record of 10 wins, 4 losses and 1 draw while fighting for promotions such as King of the Cage and World Extreme Cagefighting in his native California. === The Ultimate Fighter 2 === On episode three of The Ultimate Fighter 2, fighter Josh Burkman was asked to leave due to a broken arm and Von Flue came to the team of Matt Hughes as a replacement fighter. Considered the underdog, he went on to get an upset win in his first fight against Jorge Gurgel. Despite his performance, he was given to team Franklin when Hughes was forced to give up one of his members to the other team. He faced former teammate Joe Stevenson in the semifinals, losing due to an armbar submission. After his performance on the show, he was signed to a UFC contract. === Ultimate Fighting Championship === In his first match since the show, Von Flue fought at Ultimate Fight Night 3 where he defeated season one The Ultimate Fighter contestant Alex Karalexis via technical submission, as Karalexis was rendered unconscious by a shoulder choke from side control. This technique is now commonly known as a Von Flue Choke. Though this unique choke submission was around before Von Flue, he was perhaps the first person to get a technical submission on a large stage.In his second UFC match at Ultimate Fight Night 4, he was defeated by fellow TUF 2 contestant Luke Cummo via decision. For his third fight in the UFC, Von Flue faced Joe Riggs at UFC Fight Night 6 on August 17, 2006. He lost the fight via triangle choke submission, and was subsequently released from the promotion. === Strikeforce === Two months after his UFC release, Von Flue signed with now-defunct promotion Strikeforce. He debuted for the promotion on October 4, 2006, facing Eric Wray at Strikeforce: Tank vs. Buentello. He won the fight via arm-triangle choke. Von Flue then faced Cung Le at Strikeforce: Triple Threat on December 8, 2006. He lost the fight via doctor stoppage TKO, due to a cut that opened up on Von Flue. Von Flue faced Luke Stewart at Strikeforce Shamrock vs. Baroni and lost via TKO in the third round. He was subsequently released from the promotion following this loss. === Independent promotions === In his last fight in mixed martial arts, Von Flue faced Marcus Gaines at TWC: Trauma on July 23, 2009. He lost the fight via second round submission. Von Flue was scheduled to return from a near five-year retirement and face Conor Cooke at Cage Contender 18 on April 26, 2014, however the bout would be cancelled prior to the event for unknown reasons. == Mixed martial arts record == === Mixed martial arts exhibition match record === == References == == External links == Professional MMA record for Jason Von Flue from Sherdog Von Flue\\'s UFC Profile Jason Von Flue at IMDb Von Flue\\'s OFFICIAL MySpace',\n",

              " 'The bond valence method or mean method (or bond valence sum) (not to be mistaken for the valence bond theory in quantum chemistry) is a popular method in coordination chemistry to estimate the oxidation states of atoms. It is derived from the bond valence model, which is a simple yet robust model for validating chemical structures with localized bonds or used to predict some of their properties. This model is a development of Pauling\\'s rules. == Method == The basic method is that the valence V of an atom is the sum of the individual bond valences vi surrounding the atom: V = ∑ ( v i ) {\\\\displaystyle V=\\\\sum (v_{\\\\text{i}})} The individual bond valences in turn are calculated from the observed bond lengths. v i = exp \\u2061 ( R 0 − R i b ) {\\\\displaystyle v_{\\\\text{i}}=\\\\exp \\\\left({\\\\frac {R_{0}-R_{\\\\text{i}}}{b}}\\\\right)} Ri is the observed bond length, R0 is a tabulated parameter expressing the (ideal) bond length when the element i has exactly valence 1, and b is an empirical constant, typically 0.37 Å. Another formula for v i {\\\\displaystyle v_{\\\\text{i}}} has also been used: v i = ( R i R 0 ) − 6 {\\\\displaystyle v_{\\\\text{i}}=\\\\left({\\\\frac {R_{\\\\text{i}}}{R_{0}}}\\\\right)^{-6}} == Theory == === Introduction === Although the bond valence model is mostly used for validating newly determined structures, it is capable of predicting many of the properties of those chemical structures that can be described by localized bonds In the bond valence model, the valence of an atom, V, is defined as the number of electrons the atom uses for bonding. This is equal to the number of electrons in its valence shell if all the valence shell electrons are used for bonding. If they are not, the remainder will form non-bonding electron pairs, usually known as lone pairs. The valence of a bond, S, is defined as the number of electron pairs forming the bond. In general this is not an integral number. Since each of the terminal atoms contributes equal numbers of electrons to the bond, the bond valence is also equal to the number of valence electrons that each atom contributes. Further, since within each atom, the negatively charged valence shell is linked to the positively charged core by an electrostatic flux that is equal to the charge on the valence shell, it follows that the bond valence is also equal to the electrostatic flux that links the core to the electrons forming the bond. The bond valence is thus equal to three different quantities: the number of electrons each atom contributes to the bond, the number of electron pairs that form the bond, and the electrostatic flux linking each core to the bonding electron pair. === The valence sum rule === It follows from these definitions, that the valence of an atom is equal to the sum of the valences of all the bonds it forms. This is known as the valence sum rule, Eq. 1, which is central to the bond valence model. V = s u m ( S j ) {\\\\displaystyle V=sum(S_{j})} (Eq. 1)A bond is formed when the valence shells of two atoms overlap. It is apparent that the closer two atoms approach each other, the larger the overlap region and the more electrons are associated with the bond. We therefore expect a correlation between the bond valence and the bond length and find empirically that for most bonds it can be described by Eq. 2: S = e x p ( ( R o − R ) / b ) {\\\\displaystyle S=exp((Ro-R)/b)} (Eq. 2)where S is the valence and R is the length of the bond, and Ro and b are parameters that are empirically determined for each bond type. For many bond types (but not all), b is found to be close to 0.37 Å. A list of bond valence parameters for different bond types (i.e. for different pairs of cation and anion in given oxidation states) can be found at the web site. It is this empirical relation that links the formal theorems of the bond valence model to the real world and allows the bond valence model to be used to predict the real structure, geometry and properties of a compound. If the structure of a compound is known, the empirical bond valence - bond length correlation of Eq. 2 can be used to estimate the bond valences from their observed bond lengths. Eq. 1 can then be used to check that the structure is chemically valid; any deviation between the atomic valence and the bond valence sum needs to be accounted for. === The distortion theorem === Eq. 2 is used to derive the distortion theorem which states that the more the individual bond lengths in a coordination sphere deviate from their average, the more the average bond length increases provided the valence sum is kept constant. Alternatively if the average bond length is kept constant, the more the bond valence sum increases === The valence matching rule === If the structure is not known, the average bond valence, Sa can be calculated from the atomic valence, V, if the coordination number, N, of the atom is known using Eq. 3. S a = V / N {\\\\displaystyle S_{a}=V/N} (Eq. 3)If the coordination number is not known, a typical coordination number for the atom can be used instead. Some atoms, such as sulfur(VI), are only found with one coordination number with oxygen, in this case 4, but others, such as sodium, are found with a range of coordination numbers, though most lie close to the average, which for sodium is 6.2. In the absence of any better information, the average coordination number observed with oxygen is a convenient approximation, and when this number is used in Eq. 3, the resulting average bond valence is known as the bonding strength of the atom. Since the bonding strength of an atom is the valence expected for a bond formed by that atom, it follows that the most stable bonds will be formed between atoms with the same bonding strengths. In practice some tolerance is allowed, but bonds are rarely formed if the ratio of the bonding strengths of the two atoms exceeds two, a condition expressed by the inequality shown in Eq. 4. This is known and the valence matching rule. 0.5 < ( S 1 / S 2 ) < 2.0 {\\\\displaystyle 0.5<(S_{1}/S_{2})<2.0} (Eq. 4)Atoms with non-bonding valence electrons, i.e., with lone pairs, have more flexibility in their bonding strength than those without lone pairs depending on whether the lone pairs are stereoactive or not. If the lone pairs are not stereoactive, they are spread uniformly around the valence shell, if they are stereoactive they are concentrated in one portion of the coordination sphere preventing that portion from forming bonds. This results in the atom having a smaller coordination number, hence a higher bonding strength, when the lone pair is stereoactive. Ions with lone pairs have a greater ability to adapt their bonding strength to match that of the counter-ion. The lone pairs become stereoactive when the bonding strength of the counter-ion exceeds twice the bonding strength of the ion when its lone pairs are inactive.Compounds that do not satisfy Eq. 4 are difficult, if not impossible, to prepare, and chemical reactions tend to favour the compounds that provide the best valence match. For example, the aqueous solubility of a compound depends on whether its ions are better matched to water than they are to each other. === Electronegativity === Several factors influence the coordination number of an atom, but the most important of these is its size; larger atoms have larger coordination numbers. The coordination number depends on the surface area of the atom, and so is proportional to r2. If VE is the charge on the atomic core (which is the same as the valence of the atom when all the electrons in the valence shell are bonding), and NE is the corresponding average coordination number, VE/NE is proportional to the electric field at the surface of the core, represented by SE in Eq. 5: S E = V E / N E {\\\\displaystyle S_{E}=V_{E}/N_{E}} (Eq. 5)Not surprisingly, SE gives the same ordering of the main group elements as the electronegativity, though it differs in its numerical value from traditional electronegativity scales. Because it is defined in structural terms, SE is the preferred measure of electronegativity in the bond valence model, === The ionic model === The bond valence model can be reduced to the traditional ionic model if certain conditions are satisfied. These conditions require that atoms be divided into cations and anions in such a way that (a) the electronegativity of every anion is equal to, or greater than, the electronegativity of any of the cations, (b) that the structure is electroneutral when the ions carry charges equal to their valence, and (c) that all the bonds have a cation at one end and an anion at the other. If these conditions are satisfied, as they are in many ionic and covalent compounds, the electrons forming a bond can all be formally assigned to the anion. The anion thus acquires a formal negative charge and the cation a formal positive charge, which is the picture on which the ionic model is based. The electrostatic flux that links the cation core to its bonding electrons now links the cation core to the anion. In this picture, a cation and anion are bonded to each other if they are linked by electrostatic flux, with the flux being equal to the valence of the bond. In a representative set of compounds Preiser et al. have confirmed that the electrostatic flux is the same as the bond valence determined from the bond lengths using Eq. 2. The association of the cation bonding electrons with the anion in the ionic model is purely formal. There is no change in physical locations of any electrons, and there is no change in the bond valence. The terms \"anion\" and \"cation\" in the bond valence model are defined in terms of the bond topology, not the chemical properties of the atoms. This extends the scope of the ionic model well beyond compounds in which the bonding would normally be considered as \"ionic\". For example, methane, CH4, obeys the conditions for the ionic model with carbon as the cation and hydrogen as the anion (or vice versa, since carbon and hydrogen have the same electronegativity). For compounds that contain cation-cation or anion-anion bonds it is usually possible to transform these homoionic bonds into cation-anion bonds either by treating the atoms linked by the homoionic bond as a single complex cation (e.g., Hg22+), or by treating the bonding electrons in the homoionic bond as a pseudo-anion to transform a cation-cation bond into two cation - pseudo-anion bonds, e.g., Hg2+-e2−-Hg2+. === The covalent model === Structures containing covalent bonds can be treated using the ionic model providing they satisfy the topological conditions given above, but a special situation applies to hydrocarbons which allows the bond valence model to be reduced to the traditional bond model of organic chemistry. If an atom has a valence, V, that is equal to its coordination number, N, its bonding strength according to Eq. 3 is exactly 1.0 vu (valence units), a condition that greatly simplifies the model. This condition is obeyed by carbon, hydrogen and silicon. Since these atoms all have bonding strengths of 1.0 vu the bonds between them are all predicted to have integral valences with carbon forming four single bonds and hydrogen one. Under these conditions, the bonds are all single bonds (or multiples of single bonds). Compounds can be constructed by linking carbon and hydrogen atoms with bonds that are all exactly equivalent. Under certain conditions, nitrogen can form three bonds and oxygen two, but since nitrogen and oxygen typically also form hydrogen bonds, the resulting N-H and O-H bonds have valences less than 1.0 vu, leading through the application of Eq. 1, to the C-C and C-H bonds having valences that differ from 1.0 vu. Nevertheless, the simple bonding rules of organic chemistry are still good approximations, though the rules of the bond valence model are better. === Predicting bonding geometry === A chemical structure can be represented by a bond network of the kind familiar in molecular diagrams. The infinitely connected bond networks found in crystals can be simplified into finite networks by extracting one formula unit and reconnecting any broken bonds to each other. If the bond network is not known, a plausible network can be created by connecting well matched cations and anions that satisfy Eq. 4. If the finite network contains only cation-anion bonds, every bond can be treated as an electric capacitor (two equal and opposite charges linked by electrostatic flux). The bond network is thus equivalent to a capacitive electrical circuit with the charge on each capacitor being equivalent to the bond valence. The individual bond capacitors are not initially known, but in the absence of any information to the contrary we assume that they are all equal. In this case the circuit can be solved using the Kirchhoff equations, yielding the valences of each bond. Eq. 2 can then be used to calculate bond lengths which are found to lie within a few picometres of the observed bond lengths if no additional constraints are present. Additional constraints include electronic anisotropies (lone pairs and Jahn-Teller distortions) or steric constraints, (bonds stretched or compressed in order to fit them into three-dimensional space). Hydrogen bonds are an example of a steric constraint. The repulsion resulting from the close approach of the donor and acceptor atoms causes the bonds to be stretched, and under this constraint the distortion theorem predicts that the hydrogen atom will move off-center.The bond valence is a vector directed along the bond since it represents the electrostatic field linking the ions. If the atom is unconstrained, the sum of the bond valence vectors around an atom is expected to be zero, a condition that limits the range of possible bond angles. === Strengths and limitations of the model === The bond valence model is an extension of the electron counting rules and its strength lies in its simplicity and robustness. Unlike most models of chemical bonding, it does not require a prior knowledge of the atomic positions and so can be used to construct chemically plausible structures given only the composition. The empirical parameters of the model are tabulated and are readily transferable between bonds of the same type. The concepts used are familiar to chemists and provide ready insight into the chemical restraints acting on the structure. The bond valence model uses mostly classical physics, and with little more than a pocket calculator, it gives quantitative predictions of bond lengths and places limits on what structures can be formed. However, like all models, the bond valence model has its limitations. It is restricted to compounds with localized bonds; it does not, in general, apply to metals or aromatic compounds where the electrons are delocalized. It cannot in principle predict electron density distributions or energies since these require the solution of the Schoedinger equation using the long-range Coulomb potential which is incompatible with the concept of a localized bond. == History == The bond valence method is a development of Pauling\\'s rules. In 1930, Lawrence Bragg showed that Pauling\\'s electrostatic valence rule could be represented by electrostatic lines of force emanating from cations in proportion to the cation charge and ending on anions. The lines of force are divided equally between the bonds to the corners of the coordination polyhedron. Starting with Pauling in 1947 a correlation between cation–anion bond length and bond strength was noted. It was shown later that if bond lengths were included in the calculation of bond strength, its accuracy was improved, and this revised method of calculation was termed the bond valence. These new insights were developed by later workers culminating in the set of rules termed the bond valence model. == Actinide oxides == It is possible by bond valence calculations to estimate how great a contribution a given oxygen atom is making to the assumed valence of uranium. Zachariasen lists the parameters to allow such calculations to be done for many of the actinides. Bond valence calculations use parameters which are estimated after examining a large number of crystal structures of uranium oxides (and related uranium compounds); note that the oxidation states which this method provides are only a guide which assists in the understanding of a crystal structure. For uranium binding to oxygen the constants R0 and B are tabulated in the table below. For each oxidation state use the parameters from the table shown below. == Doing the calculations == It is possible to do these simple calculations on paper or to use software. A program which does it can be obtained free of charge. In 2020 David Brown published a nearly comprehensive set of bond valence parameters on the IuCr web site. == References ==',\n",

Kulim (Malaysia) Berhad is a subsidiary of Johor Corporation. == History == Kulim (Malaysia) Berhad traces its history back to 1933 when Kulim Rubber Plantations Ltd was incorporated in United Kingdom. Kulim was later incorporated as a public limited company and was listed on Main Board of the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (now known as the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad) in 1975. In 1976, Johor Corporation became the major shareholder of Kulim. Over the years, Kulim has grown to become a diversified plantation company and continues to strengthen its position by securing new hectarages while developing and strengthening its intrapreneur ventures. At the end of 2013, Kulim once again made its way into Indonesia with acquisition of 74% equity in PT Wisesa Inspirasi Nusantara, a plantation holding company in Indonesia, holding rights over 40,645 hectares of potential oil palm land in Central Kalimantan. With the completion of this strategic acquisition, as at the time of writing, the Kulim Group’s direct and indirect landholding stands at over 91,000 hectares (excluding NBPOL which was held for sale as at 31 December 2014), spread across Malaysia and Indonesia. After having footholds in O&G related businesses in Malaysia, Kulim had on 10 December 2014, entered into a Conditional Subscription and Shares Purchase. Agreement with the existing shareholders of PT Citra Sarana Energi (“PT CSE”) for acquisition of 60% equity interest in the Company. This will enable Kulim to expand its involvement in the O&G sector particularly in Indonesia, moving up the value chain into the upstream activities - exploration and production. == Core Business == === Plantation === Kulim has operations currently spanning over Malaysia (within State Johor and Pahang) and Indonesia (Sumatera Selatan). === Malaysia Palm Oil Plantations Estate & Mills === Palm Oil Estates and also manage some of Johor Corporation Estates and smallholder cooperation Ladang Ulu Tiram, Johor Bahru Ladang Sedenak, Kulai Ladang Rengam, Kluang Ladang Basir Ismail, Johor Bahru Ladang REM, Kota Tinggi Ladang Siang, Kota Tinggi Ladang Sungai Papan, Kota Tinggi Ladang Sindora, Kluang Ladang Sungai Tawing, Kluang Ladang Mutiara, Kluang, Ladang Sungai Sembrong, Kluang Ladang Tereh Utara, Kluang Ladang Tereh Selatan, Kluang Ladang Selai, Kluang Ladang Enggang, Kluang Ladang Labis Bahru, Segamat Ladang Pasir Panjang, Kota Tinggi Ladang Pasir Logok, Kota Tinggi Ladang Bukit Kelompok, Kota Tinggi Ladang Kuala Kabong, Kulai Ladang Bukit Payong, Kota Tinggi Ladang Asam Bubok, Batu Pahat Ladang Palong, Segamat Ladang Sepang Loi, Segamat Ladang Kemedak, Segamat Ladang Mungka, Segamat Ladang UMAC, Pahang === Palm Oil Mill === Sindora Palm Oil Mill, Kluang Sedenak Palm Oil Mill, Kulai Tereh Palm Oil Mill, Kluang Palong Cocoa & Palm Oil Mill, Segamat Pasir Panjang Palm Oil Mill, Kota Tinggi === Pineapple === Kulim Pineapple Farm, Ulu Tiram KPF Tanah Abang, Mersing (Join venture with other party) === Intrapreneur Venture === Established as one of Kulim’s principal growth thrust, Intrapreneur Ventures (“IV”) Division is involved in a diverse range of businesses including shipping and logistics, support operations for plantations, including agricultural machinery, oil palm nursery and mills maintenance, support operations for Oil and Gas (“O&G”) sector as well as IT-related services.

              " 'Stepfather is the fifth album by the People Under the Stairs. The album signified a departure from the group\\'s previous, Golden age hip hop sound, and the album introduced a more widely varied array of sample sources. The album also spawned two singles, \"Tuxedo Rap\" and \"Pass The 40\". Distribution of the album was handled in the United States by the local Los Angeles label Basement Records, and the release overseas was handled by Tres Records, a label co-founded by Thes One with Chikara Kurahashi from Giant Panda. == Background == After the release of the People Under the Stairs\\' previous record, ...Or Stay Tuned and another world tour, Thes One and Double K found themselves free of their record contract with Om Records, and as a result, the group felt more personally responsible for the direction of their music. They also took some time to record side projects, and Thes One married his longtime girlfriend. The group started to move away from the \"party life\" they had enjoyed while making the previous albums, and the musical and lyrical themes that would be present on their next record reflected that growth. == Recording == When they began work on the new album in 2005, Thes One and Double K were feeling that sample-based hip hop was becoming repetitive and gravitating increasingly toward overused jazz samples. They even went so far as to feel critical of the success of their final Om releases, O.S.T. and ...Or Stay Tuned. The group was also unhappy with the rise in internet music piracy and the drive by music companies to push artists toward \"hot singles\" and away from themed albums. Due to all these factors, People Under the Stairs made a conscious decision to be as different and unique as possible in their attempt to create a cohesive album with a broader, less jazzy sound palette. They felt they had to step away from what they perceived as a stale hip hop scene as it existed in Los Angeles.Determined to make their new album all about the new musical direction they were taking, Thes One and Double K released Stepfather with an extremely toned-down, minimalist album cover by Thes One\\'s long time friend, Joshua Dunn of the design team Secret Pizza Party (who later became an editor for Wax Poetics). The cover was meant to look like a \"working copy\" record sleeve, with just the group\\'s name in Umbra font and two fireworks prints, as well as the album\\'s name and a phone number.People Under the Stairs invited keyboardist Kat Ouano of the Oakland-based Crown City Rockers to play on the album-closing track, \"On & On\". Her bandmate, Headnodic, had played on People Under the Stairs\\' third album, O.S.T., and both musicians have since been invited back several times on subsequent releases. Double K, a lifelong fan of the P-Funk collective, also invited George Clinton to be a part of the album, and Clinton agreed. He appears on the track \"The Doctor and the Kidd\". While record digging at a flea market in Mexico City in 2005, Thes One came across a copy of the EP, Matt the Cat, by Matthew Cassell, a musician who recorded a small body of material during the late 1970s. Thes One was instantly drawn to the record, and believing it to be a Mexican album, he included a sample of \"All I\\'m Missing is You\" by Cassell on the People Under the Stairs track \"You\". When Cassell discovered that Thes One (and other DJs) had re-discovered his music, he requested that his name be included in the writing credits for the tracks on which he was sampled, including \"You\". == Fake leak == Stepfather was released during the peer-to-peer file sharing explosion, and subsequently, many unauthorized demos and bootlegs of forthcoming albums were finding their way into the hands of fans before the artists could release finalized albums. As a precautionary measure, Thes One and Double K recorded a \"fake album\" (also titled Stepfather), and intentionally leaked the fake album (with the help of the People Under the Stairs online message board) onto the internet on February 21, 2006. The leak consisted of several tracks of Thes One reciting The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, sandwiched between introductory and concluding tracks which ridiculed the listener for being too eager to get the album. The fake leak (along with three bonus tracks) was later released as a promotional CD called Redheaded Stepfather: The Fake Leak in collaboration with the online retailer HipHopSite.com and given away with pre-orders of the album. == Reception and touring == Stepfather debuted at #32 on the Billboard Heatseaker Chart and #35 on the Billboard Independent Albums chart. Allmusic, in a positive review, stated that the album \"successfully combines rhymes, beats, groove, and flow into one really coherent, 20-song record\" and called the group \"experienced leaders who\\'ve made their mark in the music\". Upon release of the album, Tiny Mix Tapes reviewer Alan Ranta also called the group \"movement leaders\" of \"culturally positive hip-hop\" and called the album \"the type of music that saves lives and makes good days great\".At initial in-store concerts in support of the album, Thes One and Double K noticed that the average age of the people coming out to support them was much younger than they were expecting. Excited that they were reaching a new generation of hip hop fans, the group asked for their United States tour dates to be \"all ages\" shows and in-store appearances at record shops in an effort to reach out to the new young audience.They toured the US through Spring 2006, taking along the then-unknown rock-rap group Gym Class Heroes as their opening act. In the Summer and Fall of 2006, the group embarked on another world tour, visiting Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Europe. For the Europe leg of the tour, they were accompanied by Giant Panda. In 2007, the group made additional visits to the UK and the Western United States. == Track listing == All songs written by Christopher \"Thes One\" Portugal and Michael \"Double K\" Turner, except where noted. The compact disc version of the album was also released with a bonus DVD, which included: several short videos about the group and creating the album \"Ice Castle 2001\" (a short film) two music videos for Thes One\\'s Bloquera side project a music video for Double K\\'s side project Tha Brothaload a hidden easter egg of Thes One as a contestant on The Price Is Right == References == == External links == Official People Under The Stairs Website Official Stepfather lyrics page on The Point of the Rhyme',\n",
              " 'In carbohydrate chemistry, the Lobry de Bruyn–Van Ekenstein transformation also known as the Lobry de Bruyn–Alberda van Ekenstein transformation is the base or acid catalyzed transformation of an aldose into the ketose isomer or vice versa, with a tautomeric enediol as reaction intermediate. Ketoses may be transformed into 3-ketoses, etcetera. The enediol is also an intermediate for the epimerization of an aldose or ketose. The reactions are usually base catalyzed, but can also take place under acid or neutral conditions. A typical rearrangement reaction is that between the aldose glyceraldehyde and the ketose dihydroxyacetone in a chemical equilibrium. The Lobry de Bruyn–Van Ekenstein transformation is relevant for the industrial production of certain ketoses and was discovered in 1885 by Cornelis Adriaan Lobry van Troostenburg de Bruyn and Willem Alberda van Ekenstein. == Aldose-ketose transformation == The following scheme describes the interconversion between an aldose and a ketose, where R is any organic residue. The equilibrium or the reactant to product ratio depends on concentration, solvent, pH and temperature. At equilibrium the aldose and ketose form a mixture which in the case of the glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone is also called glycerose. A related reaction is the alpha-ketol rearrangement. == Epimerization == The carbon atom at which the initial deprotonation takes place is a stereocenter. If, for example, D-glucose (an Aldose) rearranges to D-fructose, the ketose, the stereochemical configuration is lost in the enol form. In the chemical reaction the enol can be protonated from two faces, resulting in the backformation of glucose or the formation of the epimer D-mannose. The final product is a mix of D-glucose, D-fructose and D-mannose. == References ==',\n",

Director Ridley Scott offered Streitenfeld his first composing job when he asked him to write the score for A Good Year (2006). Streitenfeld has written five film scores for Scott, including the BAFTA nominated score for American Gangster (2007), for which he won the \"Discovery of the Year\" Award at the World Soundtrack Awards, the sci-fi adventure Prometheus (2012) and the action adventure Robin Hood (2010).

              " 'Subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord, also known as myelosis funiculus, or funicular myelosis, also Lichtheim\\'s disease, and Putnam-Dana syndrome, refers to degeneration of the posterior and lateral columns of the spinal cord as a result of vitamin B12 deficiency (most common), vitamin E deficiency, and copper deficiency. It is usually associated with pernicious anemia. == Signs and symptoms == The onset is gradual and uniform. The pathological findings of subacute combined degeneration consist of patchy losses of myelin in the dorsal and lateral columns. Patients present with weakness of the legs, arms, and trunk, and tingling and numbness that progressively worsens. Vision changes and change of mental state may also be present. Bilateral spastic paresis may develop and pressure, vibration and touch sense are diminished. A positive Babinski sign may be seen. Prolonged deficiency of vitamin B12 leads to irreversible nervous system damage. HIV-associated vacuolar myelopathy can present with a similar pattern of dorsal column and corticospinal tract demyelination.It has been thought that if someone is deficient in vitamin B12 and folic acid, the vitamin B12 deficiency must be treated first. However, the basis for this has been challenged, although due to ethical considerations it is no longer able to be tested if \"neuropathy is made more severe as a result of giving folic acid to vitamin B12- deficient individuals\". And that if this were the case, then the mechanism remains unclear.Administration of nitrous oxide anesthesia can precipitate subacute combined degeneration in people with subclinical vitamin B12 deficiency, while chronic nitrous oxide exposure can cause it even in persons with normal B12 levels. Posterior column dysfunction decreases vibratory sensation and proprioception (joint sense). Lateral corticospinal tract dysfunction produces spasticity and dorsal spinocerebellar tract dysfunction causes ataxia. == Cause == In general, the most common cause of this condition is a deficiency of vitamin B12. This may be due to a dietary deficiency, malabsorption in the terminal ileum, lack of intrinsic factor secreted from gastric parietal cells, or low gastric pH inhibiting attachment of intrinsic factor to ileal receptors. The disease can also be caused by inhalation of nitrous oxide, which inactivates vitamin B12.Vitamin E deficiency, which is associated with malabsorption disorders such as cystic fibrosis and Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome, can cause a similar presentation due to the degeneration of the dorsal columns. == Diagnosis == Serum vitamin B12, methylmalonic acid, Schilling test, and a complete blood count, looking for megaloblastic anemia if there is also folic acid deficiency or macrocytic anemia. The Schilling test is no longer available in most areas.MRI-T2 images may reveal increased signal within the white matter of the spinal cord, predominantly in the posterior columns and possibly in the spinothalamic tracts. == Treatment == Therapy with vitamin B12 results in partial to full recovery where SACD has been caused by vitamin B12 deficiency, depending on the duration and extent of neurodegeneration. == References == == External links ==',\n",
              " 'Funeral Composition is painting by Yiannis Moralis from 1958. == Description == The painting has dimensions of 204 x 224 centimeters. It is in the collection of the National Gallery-Museum Alexandros Soutzos (Ex. 2432). == Analysis == This work of Yannis Moralis brings together a number of key features that seem of interest and concern to the artist since the early 1950s. It manifests the experimentation taking place in the broader displacement of Greek painting in the 1950s and 1960 to formalities. The subject of the composition is a farewell scene with clear references to thematic and component level to the ancient columns as he acknowledges: \"The first to have correlated these works with ancient monuments and the tombstone was Manolis Hatzidakis, Angelos Prokopios, Elias Petropoulos, George Savvides. They followed other analyzes, more scientific. Seferis says, [...] the interpretation of each project is the interpretation of ourselves. But, it is true that there is in these works a sense of death that was taught by ancient monuments.\" The same had decisively affect the Pompeian painting .. Even Xenagontas\\' students of the Athens School of Fine Arts, in the course of their visit to the National Gallery rooms in 1988, will stop in front of the particular project and referring to it will say: \"Here the common denominator is the background color, preparation (ocher, black). the use as color, like a shadow, like the Byzantine and post the protroplasm. We work piecemeal, but must not lose the image of the whole. and do not hesitate to sacrifice. You start to paint when you start sacrifice, as he and Delacroix. Emotionally you can start from a detail. but another motivation and another how will the symbol. The painting is a language finite, like all languages. There can be everything we want to say. When you accept this the contract in a strange way, liberate. And you learn to read your works, after making them. This will help you a lot.\" == The Venice Biennale (1958) and the first solo exhibition in Athens (1959) == The painting composition Funeral Composition is also of interest in connection with the participation of the artist in two reports important for his resume: his participation, along with Yannis Tsarouhis and Anthony Soho in 1958 at the Venice Biennale, where of course, Commissioner of Tonis Spiteris, representing Greece, and organize the first solo exhibition the artist held in Athens, showroom Armos particular, the next years. The painting was between projects Moralis presented in both cases. In an international environment where most dominating remove, anthropocentric painting of Moralis and Tsarouhis initiate the interest of Gio Ponti, who will devote their magazine Domus \"three pages, with plenty of pictures and text very laudatory\", which of course will delight both dialectical artists, considering how hard it was for a Greek painter distract abroad. indeed will be the occasion to discuss all those features of representational painting involving removal, even if this sounds as paradox. Giò Ponti: There is a secret sect, the sect of those who know how to depict the human form. [...] And feel passionate bliss to enjoy with animal joy the opportunity to represent this form in all activities and on the physiognomy display fleeting expressions and to distinguish the characteristics of a precise contours [...] to depict seeing in this image, in this profile an extreme limit of humanity expression, human history but also the history of our time described simultaneously. The two Greek painters Yannis Moralis and John Tsarouhis belong to this \"mystical company.\" because as I saw in Venice their projects, and was glad, because to the same sect, I belonged too. == References == == Bibliography == Καψάλης, Δ.

This includes the tracking of such items as the attorneys and other workers on the case, type of legal work, industry of the client, witnesses, judges, Courts, opposing counsel, issues, documents, budgets and invoices associated with each particular legal matter. Corporations can use matter legal matter management software and systems to manage both their in-house counsel staffs as well as their outside counsel law firms and non-law firm legal service providers who work on legal matters on the corporation\\'s behalf (i.e., expert witnesses, court reporters, copy services, etc.). Law firms might use matter management to organize information about documents and email, time worked or billed, people inside and outside the firm associated with case, deadlines and dockets, and much more. Matter management systems can provide excellent communication and collaboration platforms to organize and distribute information, although new web-based collaboration tools are beginning to reduce the need for matter management systems as collaboration tools. Matter-centric collaboration tools may be the next step. As these systems entail the processing and storage of confidential corporate and insurance carrier financial data, sensitive claims information, and privileged legal matter data, major considerations in the deployment of these systems are: availability of matter-level security, ability to handle ethical walls, the level of customization the software offers, whether the software can be installed \"behind corporate security and firewalls\" or if the software is only hosted as an Internet-based ASP application and whether or not the deployment methodology meets Sarbanes-Oxley and HIPAA security and audit compliance mandates. Legal project management is a form of matter management that leverages the standards and practices of professional project management to more effectively manage legal matters or specific phases of a legal matter (e.g., legal-discovery projects).',\n",

              " 'Lochiel is a heritage-listed villa at 6 Hillside Crescent, Hamilton, City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. It was built from 1860s to 1920s. It is also known as Balmoral, Langley Grove, and Runnymeade. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 May 1999. == History == Lochiel comprises a substantial timber and masonry residence together with associated outbuildings (the former stables, shed, and lych gate) set within substantial grounds on the lower reaches of Toorak Hill overlooking the Hamilton Reach of the Brisbane River. The house has evolved over several stages: its genesis is believed to be a two-story masonry house erected by John Francis Buckland in the 1860s. After the house was purchased by John Samuel Cameron (the younger) in 1899 two timber additions were undertaken: a museum wing by 1906 and a first floor addition over the eastern wing by 1927. The layout of the garden is also believed to date from Cameron\\'s ownership. Lochiel remains in the ownership of the Cameron family; the house having been converted into flats after World War II. This history is based entirely on publicly held records. It is believed that further information is held by the Cameron family, which may well contribute further to its understanding.The land on which Lochiel stands forms part of an original deed of grant of 5 acres (2.0 ha) (described as allotment 5 of portion 1) made in April 1855 to John James Perry and William Anthony Brown both of Brisbane. It is not known whether the land was occupied at this time, however Nehemiah Bartley writing in 1854 describes a foot track over Toorak Hill (then called Gage\\'s Hill) to German Station at Nundah so avoiding the longer route by the river bank. Prior to 1845 squatting licences were known to have been granted in this vicinity (including to Gage who cleared land, and planted maize and vegetables). On the other side of Breakfast Creek, just three years after the declaration of free settlement and the first Brisbane land sales, land was offered for sale including the Newstead House, Brisbane parcel (house erected 1845/6).The value of the Breakfast Creek / Hamilton district had been recognised from the earliest settlement of Brisbane. In 1824, prior to the resiting of the Moreton Bay penal colony from Redcliffe to Brisbane, it was Breakfast Creek which was nominated by Governor Brisbane and John Oxley as a more suitable place for settlement with the rocky point now known as Cameron Rocks identified as having good anchorage and a natural wharf. The first known settlement in the district however came with the establishment in 1829 of Eagle Farm as an annexe to the penal colony. The construction of the Eagle Farm Road by convicts (later also called Breakfast Creek Road and Hamilton Road, now Kingsford Smith Drive) and a bridge across Breakfast Creek later providing impetus for the early development of the area.In 1865 allotment 5 was transferred to Peter Nicol Russell described on the title as of London but according to electoral records resident at New Farm. In the same year this was subdivided into 15 lots. An 1864 advertisement for sale of nearby lands describes the area along the Eagle Farm Road as \"at all times the most favourite direction for suburban residence, it has of late been even more enquired after for similar purposes ... Very great improvements have attended the progress of this locality during the last twelve months\".According to title\\'s information, on 21 September 1867 (but possibly some two years earlier), three of the subdivided parcels of allotment 5 (subs 11, 12, and 13) containing 2 roods 16 perches (2,400 m2) were transferred to Ellen Gertrude Buckland. EG Buckland (?-1911) was the wife of John Francis Buckland (1832–1910). JF Buckland arrived in Queensland in 1862 from England establishing an auctioneering partnership with Simon Fraser (Fraser & Buckland 1863–1873); later in business on his own account as an auctioneer and broker. He was an original member of the Nundah Divisional Board (created 1880/1) until 1883 when he became the first Chairman of the new Toombul Divisional Board of which he remained a member until the late 1880s when, with the creation of the new Hamilton Divisional Board, he no longer resided within the boundaries of Toombul. From 1882 to 1892 he was the Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for Bulimba.The first Post Office Directories (1868) record Buckland as residing at Breakfast Creek (which the area was known as). Based on a combination of the Post Office Directories and photographic evidence, it is the Bucklands who are believed to have erected what was to become the first stage of Lochiel. A photograph dated 1868 shows the house at this stage believed to have comprised 2 rooms upstairs with kitchen area below fronting what is now known as Hillside Crescent. No architect or builder has to date been identified although in 1864 Brisbane architect WH Chambers erected the Queen Street premises of Fraser and Buckland. During the Buckland\\'s residency the house appears to have been known firstly as Balmoral Cottage and from 1885 to 1886 as Runnymeade.The Bucklands\\' Toorak Hill neighbours at this time included several substantial residences: James Dickson\\'s \"Toorak\" (Toorak House) erected c. 1865, \"Eldernell\" (1869), \"Waterview\" (later \\'Camden House\\'; demolished), and \"Mt Pleasant\" (on the western side of Toorak Rd).In 1889 a further 2 roods 16 perches (2,400 m2) was added to the Runnymeade holding with resubs 11–16 of subs 6, 7, and 8 (with frontage to Dickson Terrace) being acquired again in the name of Ellen Gertrude Buckland. (This land is no longer part of the Lochiel holding and does not form part of the entry in the Heritage Register). A photograph dating from this time shows Runneymede as a masonry house in cottage orne style comprising a simple gabled front section with verandahs facing south and a gabled brick wing to the northeast, which has apparently been added by this time. The house and extension have distinctive bargeboards with wavy edges. The photograph also shows a roof in the location of the existing small shed located to the east of the house and a mature garden. In the same year the Bucklands acquired a near neighbour to the east when Kate Quinlan erected \"Maria Ville\" (later called \\'Eltham\\').In 1892, Buckland became insolvent although according to the Post Office Directories he remained at Runnymeade until the mid-1890s. From 1895 to 1897 the house is listed as vacant, but was apparently occupied for a short time thereafter by Fred Lawson (of Lawson and Johnson fancy goods dealers) and renamed Langley Grove.In 1899 the property was transferred by the mortgagee to John Samuel Cameron who renamed the house Lochiel. Cameron (1868–1917), son of John Samuel Cameron (1834–1902) and Frances Spencer Cameron was a partner in the Brisbane auctioneering firm established by his father, (John Cameron & Sons, which remains a family firm). JS Cameron Snr and his family are believed to have resided nearby to Lochiel (then Runnymeade) in the 1880s at Greenbank. In 1884 the family moved to Doowabah at Ormiston. In a manuscript held by the John Oxley Library, one of John Samuel Cameron\\'s three sisters recalls that the Camerons were very keen gardeners, and with the help of John Neish, the Scottish gardener Captain Hope of Ormiston House Estate had brought out with him, we soon had a wonderful flower and fruit garden which was greatly helped by the many sharks that were buried for fertilising purposes.In 1900 John Cameron jnr married Etty Florence Griffiths Higgins. The Lochiel household also included Marian Griffiths Higgins (later Brown; Etty\\'s daughter from her first marriage to Ernest Higgins) and two sons John Griffiths Cameron (born 1903) and Stuart Francis Griffiths Cameron (b1904). Photographs show the house and grounds prior to the erection of the museum c. 1906. The studio photographs which appear to be contemporaneous are taken from the south east and north east. They show the house prior to the enclosing of the verandahs as well as a good view of the eastern wing of the house (including a small separately roofed timber addition) prior to the addition of the upper story. The roofed area to the rear of the house is also shown. Garden structures including post and rail fences, trellises and a small building on the eastern boundary are visible.According to his sister Cameron was a keen collector, when young of Shells and Birds\\' Eggs and Native Weapons of all sorts but later became very interested in good China and Glass, particularly Bohemian and Venetian Glass, and his large collection contained many very beautiful specimens. Apparently to house his collection, by 1906, Cameron had added the museum to the western side of the house.Built of timber, the museum interior is shown in photographs as having decorative tie beams and hangers, high level windows, and a striped timber floor. The collection appears to have been highly personal and eclectic with aboriginal artefacts, oriental furniture, porcelain paintings, and sculptures filling the space. The purpose built museum is believed to be rare. To date only one other purpose built private museum has been identified: at \"Beaufort Hill\" Clayfield where in the 1920s Edward Hawkins had a museum room incorporated as part of a tower addition to an existing house.By 1906 the lychgate at the corner of Toorak Road and Hillside Crescent had also been erected. By this time Hamilton was well established as a suburb of Brisbane. In 1899 the electric tram service to Ascot commenced; subdivisions continued including that of the nearby Toorak Estate (following the death of James Dixon in 1901); in 1904 the town of Hamilton succeeded the Shire of Hamilton as the local authority area; and \"the Rocky Wharf\" (later called Cameron Rocks apparently in honour of JS Cameron), once described as the perfect landing place for a fledgling penal colony, was now a place for couples to \"spoon\" away the evening hours. A contemporary newspaper article describes the Hamilton township:\"The mansions and villas of many of Brisbane\\'s commercial men crown every green knoll, inviting the cool breezes of the eastern ocean ... Hamilton Road is a well-kept thoroughfare, and provides a much frequented drive, whilst the electric tramcars which traverse it are invariably filled on summer afternoons and evenings ... At the present time there are about 5,000 souls resident in Hamilton.\"In 1916 Cameron appointed his brothers Waverley Fletcher Cameron, Stuart William Cameron, and his wife Etty Florence Cameron as trustees. They remained as trustees administering his estate after his death in the following year on 26 April 1917. Under the terms of Cameron\\'s will, his wife continued to reside at Lochiel (including the enjoyment of the museum) until her death in August 1945 when Lochiel passed to their two sons.The Brisbane City Council Sewerage Detail Plan records that by 1927 an upper story had been added to Lochiel positioned over the early brick eastern wing, although based on photographic evidence this may have been as early as 1912. An undated photograph shows Lochiel after this addition which was detailed to match the museum wing. To date it has not been possible to identify who was responsible for this work. Based on drawings prepared by architects Job & Collins c. 1945 the upper floor was accessed by an internal stairwell from the existing eastern wing of the house.The 1927 sewerage plan shows Lochiel much as it is today although at this time the land holding still extended through to Dickson Terrace. The plan shows the small shed, garages (believed to be former stables) to the north west of the site, lychgate, and several other unidentified structures. In the 1930s half of the land holding (fronting Dickson Terrace) was reconfigured into three blocks – subs 1 and 2 with frontage to Dickson Terrace; sub 3 with a narrow frontage to Toorak Road. None of these blocks were sold but remained (as required by Cameron\\'s will) as part of the administered estate of John Samuel Cameron although sub 1 was leased from 1936 to one of the Cameron sons, John Griffiths Cameron. A house may have been erected on this site at this time.Following the death of Etty Florence Cameron in 1945, her two sons inherited the property as provided for under their father\\'s will. At this time the contents of the museum were apparently dispersed and architects Job & Collins prepared drawings for the conversion of the house into flats. One drawing also shows the pre-flat layout of the ground floor: the early masonry core of the house contains the dining room and a bedroom; the eastern wing, a bedroom, stairwell to upper level, maid\\'s room (in the timber portion), and bathroom on the verandah; to the rear of the house is the living room with stairs to basement level marked; kitchen, scullery, and associated service rooms to the west of the living room; the museum is shown with several entrances marked to other parts of the house. It is not known what use if any was made of the basement rooms (which in addition to the original kitchen rooms also includes a room under the museum). The second drawing documents the conversion of the house into the 6 existing flats.From 1947, the two Dickson Terrace blocks are separated from the main house block subs 11,12, and 13 and sub 3 (containing the house Lochiel) – each son acquiring a block with the house block being held in joint ownership. After the death of Stuart Cameron in 1972, the whole of what is now considered the Lochiel house block is acquired by John Griffiths Cameron. Lochiel was acquired by the present owners following the death of their father in 1976. A 1997 application for demolition which was refused by the Brisbane City Council attracted a considerable number of objections. Lochiel remains on the market. A feasibility study for its reuse commissioned on behalf of the Queensland Heritage Council in 1998 has identified several potential uses.In 2001, Michelle Kleist restored the mansion in 2001 but argued with the Queensland Heritage Council over a number of aspects of the restoration, including its colour. She followed the directions of the Council and later said she was happy with that outcome.In June 2006, the real estate information service RPD bought Lochiel for $6.4 million. In October 2010, the company and its founder Raymond David Catelan were fined $250,000 and $100,000 respectively for conducting unauthorised building work on Lochiel, involving the removal of walls and foundations and widening the cellar. == Description == Lochiel is a two-storeyed with basement timber structure with a masonry core and a corrugated iron gable roof. It is located on the northeastern corner of Toorak Road and Hillside Crescent, on the south facing slope of Toorak Hill overlooking the Hamilton Reach of the Brisbane River to the south. Lochiel has substantial gardens/plantings, and ancillary structures including garages (former stables), shed, and lych gate.Lochiel was constructed as a private residence and underwent two major extensions before its conversion into six flats. The earliest section of the building consisted of the existing masonry core, which comprises a south facing wing with basement rooms, and a wing at the rear forming an L-shaped plan. A large timber \"museum\" wing was added to the western end of the building forming a U-shaped plan. This wing is high-set with a recessed masonry enclosed room below. The rear wing was extended to the north and a second storey added, and later the courtyard space at the rear was enclosed. The building was subsequently converted into flats.The main entrance to Lochiel, when still a single residence, was from the south fronting Hillside Crescent. The southern elevation is high-set and consists of the \"museum\" wing at the western end, with an enclosed verandah with a corrugated iron skillion roof and brick piers which returns along the eastern side of the building.A wide entrance stair, with rendered masonry upstands to either side, is located centrally. Non-original timber framed French doors with obscured glass panes and sidelights are located at the top of the stair, the verandah has been enclosed with glass louvres and compressed sheeting, and latticed timber panels are located between the brick piers supporting the verandah. The eastern gable end of the roof has decorative timber bargeboards, and a deck opening from the first floor of the rear wing is located adjacent to the gable end and is supported by timber posts above the enclosed eastern verandah.The deck has cross-braced timber balustrades and a decorative porch/aedicule forming the entrance to the first floor. The porch/aedicule has paired timber posts with cross-bracing, latticed timber valance, louvred timber shutters above balustrade height, and decorative timber gable with battens and curved timber elements. The decorative southern gable of the first floor is located above the porch/aedicule, and has a battened timber screen with an arched central section and curved timber trim. A sash window with corrugated iron sunhood is located adjacent to the porch/aedicule.The two-storeyed rear wing is constructed of chamferboard, and overhangs the ground floor of the early rear wing on the eastern and northern sides and is supported by timber posts with curved brackets. The eastern elevation of the first floor has centrally located French doors accessed via an external timber stair, and flanked by sash windows with timber shutters to either side. A continuous corrugated iron sunhood supported by curved timber brackets shades the first floor windows and doors. The northern elevation has a large L-shaped timber stair, which bridges a driveway, accessing a central first floor porch. The porch has paired timber posts with cross-bracing, cross-braced balustrades, and non-original French doors with obscured glass panes. The porch is flanked by sash windows, and a continuous corrugated iron sunhood supported by curved timber brackets shades the windows and porch. The stair has a stepped battened timber balustrade, and the southern gable has a battened timber screen with an arched central section at the base.The western elevation of the first floor has sash windows with timber shutters flanking a smaller non-original casement window. A continuous corrugated iron sunhood supported by curved timber brackets shades these windows.The northern rear side of Lochiel consists of the enclosed courtyard flanked by the two-storeyed rear wing to the east, and the \"museum\" wing to the west. The enclosed courtyard has a corrugated iron skillion roof supported by timber posts, with louvred glass panels and compressed sheeting forming the exterior wall. A recessed entrance is located centrally, with multi-paned bifolding timber doors. A rendered masonry chimney is located at the rear of the original section of the building adjacent to the enclosed courtyard.The \"museum\" wing is constructed of chamferboard and has a corrugated iron gable roof and is supported by brick piers with latticed timber infill panels. The southern elevation is highly decorative, with a central bay window flanked by non-original casement windows (with a corner window unit to the southwest corner) and surmounted by timber detailing to the gable. The bay has narrow sash windows with etched and coloured glass panes and timber shutters. The bay is crowned by a timber valance consisting of triple curved sections, and paired lancet windows with leadlight panels are located in the gable above. The gable has a metal finial, and a battened timber screen with an arched central section and curved timber trim supported by curved timber brackets. A non original door is located on the eastern side of the bay and is accessed via a timber stair.The rear elevation of the \"museum\" wing has a metal finial and a battened timber screen to the gable, similar to the front elevation however without any of the decorative timber detailing and trim. Paired lancet windows with leadlight panels are located in the gable above a lean-to addition, which consists of an early section at the western end (possibly part of the original \"museum\" wing), and later enclosures at the eastern end. The lean-to has louvred glass windows as well as a row of fixed glass high level windows.An entrance to the rear lean-to, with a corrugated iron hood with curved timber brackets, is located on the western side. A porch with decorative timber detailing protects a second entrance located mid-way along the western elevation (this entrance was possibly originally a bay window). The porch has a gable roof with latticed timber gable panel and balustrade, curved valance and paired timber posts with cross-bracing. A continuous window hood surmounts several non-original casement windows, and two dormer windows with arched leadlight panels are located on the western side of the roof.An internal lightwell, created during the conversion of the building to flats, is located on the eastern side of the \"museum\" wing.Internally, the earliest section of the building is of rendered masonry construction and comprises two large rooms either side of a wide central hall fronting the southern verandah. Both rooms have wide timber architraves and skirtings, French doors opening to the verandah, a panelled timber door with deep reveals opening into the central hall, and a fireplace with marble surround flanked by narrow windows (now closed over but originally opened to the rear courtyard) either side. The western room has an infilled opening on the western side and a coffered ceiling with timber beams and cornice, and the eastern room has a plaster ceiling and cornice. The central hall has a plaster ceiling and cornice, and the end has been partitioned off to create a storage cupboard and the original opening to the rear has been infilled, but its form is still visible from the rear. The enclosed verandah has a raked boarded ceiling, and the western end has been partitioned off with French doors accessing a bathroom with terrazzo floor. The enclosed eastern verandah houses a kitchen area at the northern end.Internally, the rear wing is also of rendered masonry construction and comprises two large rooms with plaster ceilings and cornices, and deep timber skirtings and a timber fireplace surround to the central room. Both rooms have non-original multi-paned doors opening onto the enclosed verandah/undercroft space of the two-storeyed rear wing. The northern end of this space houses a bathroom, and the northern end of the masonry rear wing has been extended with the addition of a kitchen (possibly a free-standing structure added prior to the construction of the second storey). This kitchen structure has a raked ceiling on either side to the underside of the collar-beam, two small centrally pivoted windows which open against the rear of the end wall of the masonry wing, and a door and sash window opening to the rear.The enclosed courtyard has been partitioned into several rooms, and has raked boarded ceilings and timber floors. The posts supporting the skillion roof have chamfered corners and are set back in line with the rear of the \"museum\" wing.Internally, the \"museum\" wing currently houses two flats, but originally consisted of predominantly one large room with exposed tie-beams and hammer-posts with decorative curved timber brackets and raked boarded ceiling. A non-original ceiling has been installed to the underside of the tie-beams, and the space above, which is lit by the leadlight gable and dormer windows, remains intact with evidence of the original location of exhibits being visible. The original timber floor, consisting of alternately dark and light timber boards giving a striped appearance remains intact.The \"museum\" has been partitioned into several rooms, with plaster ceilings and cornices, timber architraves and skirtings, and casement windows. A boarded ceiling with deep cornices and high level windows is located in the rear northeast room, which is the location of the maid\\'s dining room and scullery prior to the building\\'s conversion into flats. The rear room (within the lean-to) has boarded walls and raked ceiling, and was used as a work room at the rear of the museum prior to the conversion into flats. A lightwell has been inserted into the eastern side of the \"museum\" wing adjacent to the early section of the structure (in place of the original openings into the museum from the former dining room and courtyard), and provides light and ventilation to internal rooms adjacent.The basement of the early masonry core is constructed of painted stone with brick quoining, and comprises two large rooms either side of a narrow central room. The floor of the western room is below the adjacent ground level, and a doorway to the west is accessed via stone steps. A barred window with arched header opens to the south below the verandah, and a fireplace is located against the northern wall with a narrow window adjacent. The narrow central room opens off the western room via an adjoining doorway, and has a barred window with arched header to the south. The floor of the eastern room is at the adjacent ground level, and the room is accessed via a low opening to the east, with a window with arched header to the south. A flight of stone steps is located against the northern wall at the rear of the western room, and leads to the underside of the enclosed courtyard floor.A masonry room is located below the \"museum\" wing. This room is constructed of mostly unpainted brickwork, with some rendered brickwork at the front, and has tall sash windows opening to the surrounding below floor space. The room is accessed via a door in the eastern wall (adjacent to the door accessing the basement of the early masonry core) and a door in the western wall fronting the adjacent garden. A concrete path with brick retaining wall wraps around the rear of this room with a gate accessing the adjacent garden. Internally, this room has a ripple-iron ceiling and timber architraves.Lochiel has extensive gardens, particularly to the southern part of the property. A decorative lych gate is located at the southeast of the garden, on the corner of Toorak Road and Hillside Crescent. The lych gate has brick piers surmounting rendered retaining walls either side of a flight of concrete steps. The piers support a decorative hipped gable shingle roof, which has terracotta finials at the corners, and curved projecting rafters with shaped ends. Steel gates with a concave top edge are fixed to the garden side of the lych gate. The gates access a gravel path which leads to the southern entrance to Lochiel. Both Toorak Road and Hillside Crescent frontages have rendered brick retaining walls/fences, with a driveway gate at the northern end of the property.The gravel path from the lych gate leads to a circular area with a central tree. From this area, a set of concrete steps accesses a path/terrace surmounting an embankment, with a second set of concrete steps leading to the southern entrance to Lochiel. The circular area has a stone threshold and stone pillar, and the gravel path has stone edgings and stone garden features.The southwest section of the garden consists of a grove of mature trees with a wide terrace below a dry-stone embankment. A masonry retaining wall separates this area from a raised lawn and garden on the western side of the structure. The southeast section of the garden has an open lawn bordered by mature trees and shrubs. A masonry retaining wall separates this area from a raised lawn and garden on the eastern side of Lochiel.A storage shed is located to the east of Lochiel at the northern end of the lawn. The shed has a gable roof with ribbed pan and corrugated iron sheeting and chamferboard walls. The southern gable has decorative timber bargeboards surmounting a gabled porch with latticed timber gable panel and decorative timber detailing. Lean-to structures have been added to the sides and rear of this building.The rear of the property comprises an area of lawn with stone retaining walls to the rear boundary. Garages are located at the northwest corner of the property. The garages have a corrugated iron skillion roof supported by timber posts, with a weatherboard wall at the eastern end and timber garage doors. The garages contain part of the squared rubble-coursed sandstone structure of the original stables. The sandstone forms the rear wall of the structure, with three transverse wall sections, and the western end wall has a raked parapet. Brickwork surmounts the rear sandstone wall forming a parapet, and an early set of steps is located adjacent to the western end wall. The floor of the garage is concrete. == Heritage listing == Lochiel was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 May 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland\\'s history. Arguably unique and indeed highly idiosyncratic Lochiel comprises a substantial house, outbuildings, and large established garden situated on the lower slopes of Toorak Hill overlooking the Brisbane River. It is a rare, intact, and fine example of a suburban estate; its evolution over several stages (the earliest believed to date from the 1860s) well illustrating the development of Brisbane and one of its earliest suburbs, Hamilton.The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland\\'s cultural heritage. Arguably unique and indeed highly idiosyncratic Lochiel comprises a substantial house, outbuildings, and large established garden situated on the lower slopes of Toorak Hill overlooking the Brisbane River. It is a rare, intact, and fine example of a suburban estate; its evolution over several stages (the earliest believed to date from the 1860s) well illustrating the development of Brisbane and one of its earliest suburbs, Hamilton. The early masonry core of the house, with surviving lower service area, is both a fine and rare surviving example of its type. The more idiosyncratic nature of Lochiel is more particularly found however in the form, placement, and exuberant detailing of the substantial timber additions (museum c. 1906 and upper eastern wing by 1927) and in the very building of the museum room as a purpose built private exhibition space. The garden including structural elements (such as paths, steps, walls, and decorative features) and mature plantings is also considered a rare and intact example of a pre World War II garden.The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland\\'s history. An investigation of the fabric of the house and garden and the publication of information believed held by the Cameron family have the potential to substantially contribute to the further understanding of the history of Lochiel.The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.

Lochiel has considerable aesthetic qualities including the picturesque qualities of the house and garden (including garden structures) and the site itself with its views to the riverThe place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland\\'s history. Lochiel has a long association with JF Buckland, who was prominent in Brisbane\\'s civic affairs.

Bonanza then merged with Pacific Air Lines and West Coast Airlines to form Air West which in 1968 was continuing to serve Page with daily direct F-27 flights to Phoenix via stops at the Grand Canyon airport and Prescott as well as direct to Salt Lake City via Cedar City. Air West then changed its name to Hughes Airwest which in 1972 was operating daily direct F-27 service to Las Vegas via Grand Canyon airport and also direct to Salt Lake City via Cedar City on a daily basis. By 1975, Hughes Airwest had introduced direct F-27 service on the weekdays to Los Angeles International Airport via stops at Grand Canyon, Las Vegas and Palm Springs as well as continuing to operate direct service to Salt Lake City via Cedar City. In 1977, Hughes Airwest was flying non-stop F-27 service to Phoenix on a weekday basis in addition to the direct flight to Salt Lake City via Cedar City and had turned over the Las Vegas service to SkyWest Airlines which was operating Piper Navajo twin prop aircraft on the route with non-stop flights. Hughes Airwest then discontinued all service into the airport and was no longer serving Page by 1980.Following the cessation of service by Hughes Airwest, SkyWest Airlines, operating as an independent commuter air carrier, was providing non-stop service with Piper Navajo prop aircraft to Las Vegas and Phoenix.

              " 'Charles Joseph Panarella a.k.a. \"Charlie Moose\" a.k.a. \"Len Conforti\" a.k.a. \"Chas Esposito\" (January 5, 1925 – July 18, 2017) was a New York City mobster and capo in the Colombo crime family with a brutal reputation as a hitman. == Early years == Charles was born in 1925 in Brooklyn, New York. He is also known to use January 5, 1922 as his birth date. He has used the aliases Charles Panarello, Chas Esposito, John Garguilo, Joseph Charles Panarella and Charles \"Moose\" Panarella. He stood at 6 ft (1.8 m) tall, had brown eyes and a scar on his bottom lip. In 1940, Panarella was arrested for the first time. His criminal record includes assault, burglary, extortion and possession of a loaded firearm.On August 11, 1972, Albert Gallo, brother of the late rogue Profaci crime family capo Crazy Joe Gallo (killed on April 7, 1972), had pinpointed Joseph (The Yack) Yacovelli, Alphonse (Allie the Snake) Persico Sr., Gennaro Langella and at least one other Colombo hood (thought to be Panarella) at the bar of the Neapolitan Noodle located at 320 East 79th Street in Midtown Manhattan. Minutes before the hit men arrived, however, the mobsters had moved to another table. In their place were five meat dealers from Chicago with their wives celebrating the engagement of one of their daughters to the restaurant\\'s manager. As this party moved to a table, led by the wives, the shooter, dressed in casual clothes and wearing dark glasses and a long black shoulder length wig, opened up with two guns killing Sheldon Epstein and Max Tekelch and wounding two other men. The killer escaped and was never found. The public outrage was led by New York City Mayor John V. Lindsay, who promised in running the gangsters out of town. Panarella was unharmed. Panarella once allegedly forced a man to eat his own testicles before killing him. Panarella has survived several feuds within the Colombo family that killed more than 100 people. While in New York, Panarella had a large profitable crew that included Gregory Scarpa Sr. The crew trafficked in narcotics, robbed banks, and controlled sheet metal and restaurant unions. == Exile to Las Vegas == In the mid-1980s, Panarella\\'s crew complained to Colombo boss Carmine Persico that Panarella was an abusive capo, however, the complainants were just fearful of Charlie Moose who was from the old school and didn\\'t put up with people in the crew who tried to avoid kicking up. His crew included some of the biggest killers in the family who were more than willing to put in any work that was passed down through Moose from the imprisoned Persico. Facing federal indictment, Persico feared that Panarella and caporegime John \"Sonny\" Franzese might use his legal troubles to move against him. When Panarella\\'s crew continued to complain that Moose was too demanding it gave Persico an excuse to exile Panarella to Las Vegas. Of all the people in his family, Persico feared Moose the most, then Sonny. It was legendary that Charlie had tortured and killed powerful Capo Dominic \"Mimi\" Scialo as a favor to Carlo Gambino after Scialo mocked Gambino to his face at Gargiulo\\'s Restaurant in Coney Island. Panarella would not forget this slight from Persico sending him to Vegas after being called upon by Persico dozens of times to kill for even the slightest of reasons even returning from Vegas occasionally to put work in that was ordered by his boss. In 1991, he actively sided with Victor Orena against Persico during Orena\\'s failed effort to take over the Colombo family but nobody, not even Greg Scarpa Sr. would try to kill the wily Moose. Panarella although siding with Orena mostly stayed out of the 3rd Colombo war but was called upon to kill an associate James \"Jimmy Beans\" Brunetto after Brunetto was found to have molested a 9-year-old boy in the back of R and J Health Studio a gym on Ave U. The boy was the grandson of Little Vic. Brunetto was kidnapped by a group of men after he left a bowling alley in the Mill Basin section of Brooklyn and his body has never been recovered. It is rumored that Brunetto was taken to a Sheepshead Bay Garage and that he had his penis removed and shoved up his rectum. He was supposed to be left that way on a street as a warning but because there had been a possible witness to the abduction they melted his body by acid in a 55-gallon drum, filled it with cement, and dropped it into Mill Basin from the Palone Boatyard on Ave U and East 67 Street. In 1994, Panarella was convicted of attempting to launder money through the Maxim Casino (now called the Westin Las Vegas) in Las Vegas as part of a scheme to purchase a farm for $500,000 to $1 million. Panarella had drug profits deposited at a cashier\\'s cage at the casino. In August 1994, Panarella pleaded guilty to conspiracy and served 15 months of an 18-month sentence. In September 1996, Panarella was released from prison. == Back to New York == Although living in Las Vegas, Panarella still kept some responsibilities back East. For a period of time, he was shuttling back to Brooklyn to oversee the Colombo family\\'s interests in Locals 14 and 15 of the International Union of Operating Engineers. In the summer of 2001, Panarella met in New York with Genovese family representatives over a dispute in Brooklyn. The Genovese family controlled most of the so-called \"no-show\" construction jobs in Brooklyn and the Colombo family wanted their fair share of them. Unfortunately for Panarella, the meeting location was bugged and law enforcement picked up clear evidence that he was acting as a member of the Colombo family. On December 4, 2003, Panarella was indicted in New York on a federal racketeering charge in connection with alleged labor law violations and construction payoffs. The charges were linked to alleged payoffs within Locals 14 and 15 of the International Union of Operating Engineers and to fraud in the construction of Richmond County Bank Ballpark, home of the Staten Island Yankees baseball team, and in construction of the Brooklyn General Post Office.In February 2008, Panarella was living under house arrest at his home in Kunkletown, Pennsylvania. The trial based on his 2005 racketeering indictment had been delayed due to Panarella\\'s ill health and psychological problems.In December 2012, a federal judge granted Panarella permission to travel to Long Island City, Queens in April 2013 to receive an award from his former union. It was reported that Panarella was confined to a motorized scooter and depended on portable oxygen. On July 26, 2019, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported that the Nevada Gaming Commission had removed Panarella\\'s name from its Black Book in a unanimous vote after the attorney general\\'s office submitted Panarella\\'s death certificate which revealed that he had died on July 18, 2017. “Because Mr. Panarella is deceased, he no longer poses a threat to the Nevada gaming industry, so therefore the (state Gaming Control) Board respectfully requests his removal,” Deputy Attorney General Tiffany Breinig said in remarks to the commission. == References ==',\n",

He made 12 Test appearances against France and 6 appearances against New Zealand. He was named New South Wales Player of the Year three times – 1951, 1956 and 1958. == Referee & coach == When his playing days were over he turned to refereeing. In a 1971 game between Queensland and New South Wales, Holman sent off three players.

However, no construction work was undertaken: but the authorisation prevented any competing company undertakings from supplying electricity to the area. == Regent’s Park Power Station == Work started in 1890 to build a power station east of Regent's Park on a site bounded by Stanhope Street, Longford Street and Wybert Street (TQ 290 824). The site, which then comprised residential buildings, was purchased for £10,827. The power station was known both as St. Pancras Power Station and Regent’s Park Power Station. The engine room was 106 ft by 26 ft (32.3 m by 7.9 m), the boiler house was west of the engine room and included a 90 ft (27.4 m) high brick chimney 5 ft (1.5 m) square. The principal equipment comprised: five Babcock & Wilcox boilers producing 5,000 lb/hr (0.63 kg/s) of steam at 70 psi (4.83 bar), nine triple expansion Willans-Robinson engines coupled to Kapp dynamos delivering 680 Amps at 112–130 Volts, two Willans engines driving a pair of dynamos delivering 90 Amps at 540–575 Volts for arc lights, jet condensers and a 170,000 gallon (773 m3) underground water tank, banks of batteries to equalise the voltage, the battery house was north east of the engine room.The station started generating electricity in November 1891. It was designed to supply 10,000 incandescent lamps and 90 arc lights for street lighting, with a total capacity of about 1,000 kW. Within six months of opening the load on the station was at capacity. In 1893 the Vestry installed three further boilers and three 90 kW generators which completed the station.In 1897 the plant generated 1847.18 MWh; 1342.54 MWh was sold to customers and 177.815 MWh for public, this provided an income to the corporation of £33,347-9-11. The growth of electricity supplies is illustrated in the table. In 1923 the DC generating plant was located at the Regent’s Park site and comprised 4 × 0.5 MW reciprocating generators providing a 220 / 440 DC supply. The boilers at Regent’s Park had a total evaporative capacity of 60,000 lb/hr (7.56 kg/s).The power station at Stanhope Street operated for 34 years and was closed in 1925 and all electricity generation for the Borough was undertaken at King’s Road. The area has been extensively redeveloped and there is no material evidence of the Regent’s Park power station. Some original lamp posts are extant in Tottenham Court Road, fitted with modern lamps. == King’s Road Power Station == The St. Pancras district extended over an area of 2,694 acres (1,090 ha). In 1893 the Vestry started construction of a second power station to provide electricity supplies to the north of the district. It was located on a site bounded by King’s Road, Pratt Street, Georgiana Street and Great College Street (TQ 293 839), when purchased the site was occupied by industrial buildings. The new station, also known as St. Pancras Power Station or King’s Road Power Station, was designed to burn domestic and commercial refuse as well as coal. It was commissioned in late 1895 and initially had: three ‘Lancashire’ type boilers with an evaporative capacity of 5,500 to 7,000 lb/hr (0.7–0.88 kg/s) and working at a pressure of 125 psi (8.6 bar), three Belliss engines developing 200 BHP (150 kW) at 350 RPM, each was connected to two 65 kW dynamos, provision for a further two engine/dynamo sets to be added.Condensing of steam was done using water abstracted from the nearby Regent’s Canal. There were operational problems with the refuse destructor which provided insufficient heat to raise steam in the quantities required. The destructor only handled a small proportion of the waste produced in the area and after several modifications the refuse facility was abolished in 1920, after which the boilers were coal fired. In 1913/14 a Brush-Ljungstrom turbo-generator set was installed. In 1923 the AC generating plant was located at the King’s Road site and comprised 1 × 1.5 MW, 1 × 2 MW, 2 × 3 MW and 1 × 5.6 MW turbo-generators. The boilers at King’s Road had a total evaporative capacity of 185,000 lb/hr (23.31 kg/s). Then in 1927 a 10 MW Brush-Ljungstrom turbo-generator set was added.In the early 1960s the plant at King’s Road comprised a mixture of chain grate stoker, pulverised coal, oil-fired plant and internal combustion engine prime movers. The boilers were capable of delivering 220,000 lb/hr (27.7 kg/s) of steam at 200 psi (13.8 bar) and 482/316/343 °C. The coal-fired plant was taken out of service, and during the final 3 years of operation only the oil-fired plant was used, but with a low load factor (see table). The King’s Road power station was decommissioned in 1968 after a working life of 73 years. The site is now (2020) the St. Pancras Georgiana Street sub-station. == Legislative impact == The London Government Act 1899 abolished the Vestry of St. Pancras and established St. Pancras Metropolitan Borough Council from November 1900. The Borough’s Electricity and Public Lighting Committee assumed responsibility for the power stations and the electricity distribution system.The Electricity (Supply) Act 1926 established Central Electricity Board (CEB) which was responsible for directing the operation of power stations including St. Pancras Power Stations. The CEB was also responsible for constructing the national grid which provided interconnections between electricity systems like St. Pancras, thereby enabled to import and export electricity in bulk. For example, from 1927 St. Pancras became an authorised distributor providing a supply in bulk to Islington Metropolitan Borough Council; in 1931 it supplied 38.509 MWh. It also supplied electricity to the County of London Electric Supply Company delivering 14 MWh in 1935 and 1936.Upon nationalisation of the British electricity supply industry in 1948 under the Electricity Act 1947 the ownership of King’s Road Power Station was vested in the British Electricity Authority, and then to the Central Electricity Authority, and finally to the Central Electricity Generating Board. The low voltage distribution network and sales of electricity was the responsibility of the London Electricity Board which bought electricity in bulk from the British Electricity Authority, etc. == Operational data == A summary of the operational data for the St. Pancras power stations and their associated electricity system over the working life is shown in the following table. There were two sub-stations on the St. Pancras system: at Tavistock Place and Highgate Road. The number of electricity customers in the Borough increased steadily. In 1903 there were 2,280, this increased to 5,034 in 1919, to 9,277 in 1924, and 44,161 in 1938. Until after 1920 St. Pancras power stations supplied only Direct Current to customers at 220 V and 440 V. In the year ending 31 March 1904 electricity was being sold to private consumers at 3.96 d./kWh and public lighting was charged at 2.44 d./kWh. In 1938 electricity for lighting was being charged at 2.75 d./kWh, at 0.5 d./kWh for heating and cooking, and 0.75 d./kWh for power. The Borough took a supply of electricity from the London, Midland and Scottish Railway Company at Kentish Town: 1.376 GWh in the year 1923/4 at a cost of £5,446; this arrangement continued into the 1930s. In 1922 a total of 13,558 MWh electricity was sold (16,218 MWh in 1923) this raised a total revenue of £241,623 in 1922 and £220,127 in 1923. The financial profits and losses from the supply of electricity in the Borough of St. Pancras were as follows.The income from the electricity undertaking enabled the Borough to reduce the rates (local taxes). For example, in 1921/2 from the profit of £23,129 made, £16,132 was transferred for the relief of local rates.By the late 1950s the plant comprised one 15 MW, one 12.5 MW, two 7 MW and two 3 MW Brush-Ljungstrom turbo-alternators all generating at 5.2 kV. == Culture == King’s Road power station was used as a set in the 1965 film Operation Crossbow where it represented a WW2 rocket factory. == References ==\",\n",

              " 'American Indian Stories is a collection of childhood stories, allegorical fictions and essays written by Sioux writer and activist Zitkala-Ša.First published in 1921, American Indian Stories details the hardships encountered by Zitkala-Ša and other Native Americans in the missionary and manual labour schools. The autobiographical details contrast her early life on the Yankton Indian Reservation and her time as a student at White\\'s Manual Labour Institute and Earlham College. The collection includes legends and stories from Sioux oral tradition, along with an essay titled America\\'s Indian Problem, which advocates for rights for Native Americans and calls for a greater understanding of Native American cultures. American Indian Stories offers a unique view into a society that is often overlooked though that society still persists to this day. == Book contents == === Impressions of an Indian Childhood. === ==== My Mother ==== The story begins with a description of the big path that leads from Zitkala-Sa\\'s childhood wigwam to a river which, in turn, makes its way to \"The Edge of Missouri\". Her mother would draw water from this river for household use. Zitkala-Sa would play at her mother\\'s side, noting that she was often sad and silent. At the age of seven, Zitkala-Sa describes herself as \\'wild\\' and \\'as free as the wind that blew her hair\\'. Recounting a conversation with her mother on one of their return trips from the river, Zitkala-Sa told her that when she is older like her 17-year-old cousin Warca-Ziwin, she will come and get water for her. Zitkala-Sa\\'s mother responded, \"If the paleface does not take away from us the river we drink\". Young Zitkala-Sa inquires about the palefaces, to which her mother responds, \"My little daughter, she is a sham, a sickly sham!\". Zitkala-Sa\\'s mother describes the palefaces as the cause of much sorrow for their people, who stole their land and caused the deaths of Zitkala-Sa\\'s cousin and uncle. ==== The Legends ==== Zitkala-Sa, as a \"participant and observer\", sketches the importance of the Legends of her people. In this story, Zitkala-Sa shares with the readers how, \"I loved best the evening meal, for that was the time old legends were told. I was always glad when the sun hung low in the west, for then my mother sent me to invite the neighboring old men and women to eat supper with us.\" Zitkala-Sa\\'s tribe had traditions for how and when to speak to elders, and especially how to listen to these legend stories. The atmosphere must be set, and in due time, the elders would tell the stories of their people, and pass on the Legends to the children of the tribe. Such as Zitkala-Sa was told these legends as a child, she \"attempted to preserve her people\\'s oral tradition by transcribing oral tales into written English, as well as transcribing her life\\'s story into autobiography.\"<Stanley, Sandra Kumamoto. Claiming a Native American Identity: Zitkala-Sa and Autobiographical Strategies. Pacific Coast Philology. 29/1 (September 1994) pages 64–69.> \"That Zitkala-Sa was independent enough to write about her \"varying moods\" is a credit to her and a bonus for anyone interested in some of the impulses that launched an American Indian Literary tradition in English.\" ==== The Beadwork ==== The Beadwork is a descriptive story sharing the tradition of beadwork and its place in Zitkala-Sa\\'s tribe. This story is from the experiences of a young girl who is learning the process of beadwork from her mother. Even during this time, Zitkala-Sa shares the experience of childhood envy in regards to the artist products of the beadwork of her friends. The Native American traditional education of learning the trade of beadwork is described with Zitkala-Sa sharing her \"practical observation lessons in the art of beadwork.\" (Bonnin, 19) Zitkala-Sa ends this story with, \"That evening, as on other evenings, I went to sleep over my legends,\" (Bonnin, 24) which points to the Legends noted in her other story, The Legends, as well as the childhood dreams of a young girl in Native life. ==== The Coffee Making ==== In this story, Zitkala-Sa discusses the first time she ever made coffee. Her mother had left her home alone and she was fearful of a crazy man who used to wander into wigwams. Someone did enter her wigwam, but it was an old grandfather who tells her stories. She remembers that when they have guests over, her mother makes them coffee and offers them food. Trying to be a good hostess she goes to make the coffee, although she does not know how. She tries, but what she ends up giving her grandfather is a cold mug of dirty water. Her mother arrives and sees that she has tried to make coffee and her and the grandfather laughed and her mother made more coffee. Zitkala-Sa did not feel embarrassed and it was not until she was older that she realized what she did was ridiculous. ==== The Dead Man\\'s Plum Bush ==== In this story, Zitkala-Sa describes the day when strange people with painted faces come into her neighborhood to the new warrior Haraka Wambdi\\'s wigwam. The crowd sits in the grass surrounding a fire with venison being cooked in kettles hanging above it. They are celebrating Wambdi\\'s first battle by having a feast with the whole Indian village. Zitkala-Sa, still in her own wigwam, becomes restless seeing all of the guests heading over to the feast while she has to wait for her mother to finish cooking a duck. She asks her mother why she is cooking when they are about to go to a feast in which her mother replies that they are going to stop by an ill, elderly woman\\'s wigwam to feed her on the way to the feast. This causes Zitkala-Sa to feel ashamed to have forgotten about the woman. As they walked, Zitkala-Sa was about to pick some plums off a plum bush when her mother stops her. Her mother explains that there was a dead Indian warrior buried there, and when he was buried they put plum seeds in his hand because he died with plum seeds in his hand. From those seeds rose a bush. Since then, Zitkala-Sa was careful around the bush and always listening for the whistle of departed spirits. ==== The Ground Squirrel ==== In the fall, Zitkala-Sa\\'s aunt used to help her mother preserve foods for the winter. In the early mornings a misty smoke was visible above the marsh. Zitkala-Sa is afraid of this smoke and when it was visible, Zitkala-Sa never liked to go too far from her wigwam unless she was with her mother. Her mother and aunt would gather corn and Zitkala-Sa would have to watch it while it dried. Sometimes there was a little ground squirrel that would take some of the sweet corn. She wants to catch it but her mother fears that the ground squirrel might bite her fingers. After the corn was dried, her mother would start slicing pumpkins into thin rings and hang them in between a couple poles for them to dry. Her mother also dried berries, plums, and cherries. Out of everything that had happened when preserving things in the fall, she remembers the ground squirrel the most. Most of her memories from when she was a child were in the summer but she recalls a winter day when some missionaries gave her a bag of marbles. Some of the marbles were made of colored glass. She went walking down to the river one day with her mother where she saw big floating ice chunks. The light of the day had been reflecting colors in the ice and the colors reminded her of her marbles so she tried to pry the colors out of the ice. Her fingers got too cold for her to continue but from then on she thought marbles had river ice inside of them. ==== The Big Red Apples ==== Zitkala-Sa describes in this story about how she was 8 years old. She only was aware of her mother\\'s native language. This is when the paleface missionaries began to visit her village. These visiting white men were recruiting Indian children to go to Eastern schools. Zitkala-Sa\\'s mother was hesitant of these strangers, but the children of the tribe, including Zitkala-Sa, were curious of these visitors. Zitkala-Sa had a brother, Dawe\\'e who had gone with these missionaries to receive an Eastern education. The missionaries, thus, were curious about recruiting his sister, Zitkala-Sa, to also receive this education. Against her mother\\'s wishes, Zitkala-Sa desired to explore the beautiful East lands. Zitkala Sa\\'s mother understood the other children\\'s influence on Zitkala-Sa in regards to the \"white man\\'s lies.\" (Bonnin, 41) She tried to encourage her daughter not to go by saying, \"Don\\'t believe a word they say! Their words are sweet, but, my child, their deeds are bitter.\" (Bonnin, 41) Though Zitkala-Sa did not want to disrespect her mother\\'s wishes, she was told of \\'the great tree where grew red, red apples; and how we could reach out our hands and pick all the red apples we could eat.\" As a child of 8 years, she had never tasted many apples and was very excited to roam these fields of apples. She didn\\'t understand how her mother could be so negative towards these people. 8 year old Zitkala-Sa wanted apples, she wanted adventure. The interpreter for the missionaries assured the young girl and her mother, \"Yes, little girl, the nice red apples are for those who pick them; and you will have a ride on the iron horse if you go with these good people.\" (Bonnin, 42) The innocent naïve Zitkala-Sa was insistent to go to the wonderful Eastern land to experience the unknown education of the palefaces. The young Zitkala-Sa had no idea what her adventure would entail, leaving her mother for a future paleface education, while having natural instincts, \"I was as frightened and bewildered as the captured young of a wild creature.\" (Bonnin, 45) \"By using the apple as a symbol of the Western tradition, Zitkala-Sa subverts the idea that the missionaries were \"saving the Indians\"; instead, she enacts a reverse temptation wherein the missionaries tempt her with forbidden fruit, causing her to fall out of the coherent oral culture of her mother into the \"white man\\'s\" world of knowledge, a world too often promising her \"white men\\'s lies\"—knowledge as delusion.\" (Stanley, 66) === The School Days of an Indian Girl === ==== The Land of Red Apples ==== Zitkala-Sa and seven other Dakota children head East with the missionaries by choice. They are impatient to begin the journey to the \"Red Apple Country\" where they \"dream of roaming freely and happily\". They expect a great deal of enjoyment from their ride on the iron horse (train) but are disturbed and troubled by the staring palefaces. Zitkala-Sa resents being watched and notes the paleface mother does not reprimand her children for their \"rude curiosity\" and pointing, which makes her embarrassed and on the verge of tears.She remembers seeing a telegraph pole, which was being erected by palefaces in her home land. Her thoughts on the telegraph pole help her forget her surroundings, until a missionary calls her name and tosses candies to her and other children which amuses them. Though her trip on the iron horse lasts several days, Zitkala-Sa does not remember any luncheons.They reach the school grounds at night. Her body trembles with fear and she stays close to the wall upon entering. As she quietly plans an escape, a paleface woman picks her up and tosses her in the air excitedly. Young Zitkala-Sa is both \"frightened and insulted\", because her mother never treated her in such a way. The thought of her mother makes her cry aloud. The palefaces misunderstand her tears and sit her at a table with food. An older Dakota child tells her to hold her tears until she is alone at night. She pleads for her mother, brother and aunt.From the table, the children are taken upstairs to a room lined with narrow beds. Zitkala-Sa sleeps with a tall girl, because she speaks her native tongue which soothes her. Zitkala-Sa notes she has \"arrived in the wonderful land of rosy skies\", but she is not as happy as she wishes. Her tears are \"left to dry themselves in streaks\" because her mother and aunt are not there to wipe them away. ==== The Cutting of My Long Hair ==== In the vignette, \"The Cutting of my Long Hair\", Zitkala-Sa looks at the physical differences between herself and the \"palefaces\" running the school. In the beginning of the vignette she lines up with the other American Indian children. They are about to eat breakfast, but must first pray, a new concept for her.As everyone begins, Judéwin, a girl who knows little English, frightens young Zitkala-Sa by announcing a paleface woman will cut their hair. Zitkala-Sa feels uncomfortable and cries. She is aware of her new tight-fitting clothes and uncomfortable shoes, far different from her usual dress and moccasins. After eating and getting into line, she remembers her mother said how only cowards have their hair cut from them, so she quietly slips away.Finding refuge in a dark room, Zitkala-Sa hides under a bed but soon hears voices calling her name. The women find her and she starts crying, fearful of what will happen next. They strap the frightened girl down and after feeling the cold blade on her neck they slice off her long beautiful hair. The young girl cries for her mother, but soon remembers she is not there to comfort her. ==== The Snow Episode ==== One day while playing in snowdrifts, Zitkala-Sa and her friends were told not to fall face first into the snow. Forgetting their orders, they continued to do it when a woman yelled at them from the school and told them to come inside. Judewin, the only one of the three girls who could speak English, told Zitkala-Sa and Thowin that when the \"pale face\" looks into their eyes and talks loudly they must wait until she stops and then say the word \"no\". Thowin was called into the office first. The other two waited and listened outside of the door. After listening a bit, Judewin realized she taught the girls the wrong reply. They heard Thowin say no and then she was spanked. The woman asked Thowin again if she was going to obey her the next time and Thowin replied no. The woman continued to whip her until she asked Thowin if she was going to fall in the snow again. Thowin replied no and the woman then let her out of the office. Zitkala-Sa figured she must have realized this method was not working so she left the three in the room alone. These misunderstandings continued frequently for the next couple seasons. Zitkala-Sa learned some English and became mischievous. Once when she disregarded a rule she was sent to the kitchen to mash turnips. She hated the turnips and their smell so she smashed them in their jar to a pulp. She mashed them so hard that the bottom of the glass jar they were in broke. When someone came to stop her, they lifted the jar and the bottom and all of its contents spilled onto the floor. No turnips were served for dinner that night. ==== The Devil ==== In a second vignette, \"The Devil\", young Zitkala-Sa describes a new enemy. She was taught to fear no one but the palefaces show her a detailed picture of the Devil, with horns and a slithery tail, and the image frightens her deeply. The palefaces told her \"I torture little girls who disobey school regulations\".Zitkala-Sa then describes a dream where she sees her mother and an old woman in a cottage, when the Devil bursts in and chases her. She screams out but the old woman and her mother do not hear her screaming and ignore her. Later, Zitkala-Sa scribbles over the picture, leaving a hole where the image had been. ==== Iron Routine ==== Every morning in the winter the school children would be woken up at 6:30 by a loud bell. They only had a short while to get ready until it was time for roll call which was announced by a little bell. It did not matter if the children were sick or not, they had to be down for roll call or they would be marked tardy. Zitkala-Sa remembers the time when she was sick and did not want to come down for roll call but had to. There was a little girl who was also sick and dying and one of the school teachers sat by her bedside with a cool rag and put it on her hands and feet but it made no difference, the little girl died. Zitkala-Sa hated this time and everything about it. She hated the teachers who did not care when they were sick, she hated the medicine the teachers gave her, and she hated the pencils that moved across the paper that marked her tardy. When she would feel better, she forgot her hatred and began to smile again. But she still remembers these times the most. ==== Four Strange Summers ==== ==== Incurring My Mothers Displeasure ==== === An Indian Teacher among Indians === ==== My First Day ==== ==== A Trip Westward ==== ==== My Mother\\'s Curse Upon White Settlers ==== ==== Retrospection ==== === The Great Spirit === === The Soft-Hearted Sioux === ==== I-V ==== === The Trial Path === This section tells the story of the author\\'s grandparents, as told to her by her grandmother.

His father was an Engineer and played Flute and Esraj (an Indian string instrument). From a very early age, Rabin Ghosh was influenced by the musical atmosphere, which drove him into playing Esraj, Flute, and Tabla (an Indian percussion instrument). He finally focused on Violin, under the guidance of Mr. Mani Majumder, one of the renowned violinists of the contemporary time of Western Classical Music. After continuous training on Western Classical Music he shifted to North Indian Classical Music under the guidance of \\'Sangeetacharya\\' Haripada Chattopadhay, exponent violinist of \\'Dagar Gharana\\' (Dagar school of thoughts) of North Indian Classical Music. Rabin Ghosh continued his training more than a decade under the tutelage of Haripada Chattopadhay. During this time he not only won violin Competitions, also performed in concerts along with All India Radio, Calcutta. == Way to Maihar == In the year 1955, Rabin Ghosh got an opportunity to play violin before Baba Allauddin Khan Saheb (at the time of visiting Calcutta), the doyen of Hindustani Classical Music. He played Raga Mian ki Todi before him. Baba Allauddin Khan Saheb was satisfied to accept him as his disciple. In the mid of 1955, Rabin Ghosh left for Maihar. === Life at Maihar === Life at Maihar for Rabin Ghosh was very dedicated. Besides receiving training from Baba Allauddin Khan Saheb, he was appointed as a teacher of Maihar Government Music College. Rabin Ghosh had a very strict and long duration practice session which he maintained till the last day in Maihar. In his own words \"I used to light a thick fragrance stick and would continue practice till it burned out totally\". == Contribution == At that time, Rabin Ghosh\\'s practice sessions lasted about 12 hours a day but reached a peak of 14 to 16 hours a day. During his stay at Maihar over seven and half years, he experimented with different techniques on violin sound production and researched sitting posture which helped with the long duration of practice sessions. === Invention of 5th string on violin === During the years of rigorous training under the tutelage of Baba Alauddin Khan Saheb in Maihar, Rabin Ghosh was inspired to \\'Design and Develop Five-String Violin\\'. The need to access and explore the lower octave in expressing the mood of Raga RamDashi Malhar, in 1958, the young artist Rabin Ghosh, had an extensive experimentation, which augmented 4 string violin to 5 string violin without compromising the original tonal quality of conventional violin. For Five-String Violin he used to use 1st string \\'E’ as \\'Rishav\\' (higher octave), 2nd string \\'A’ as \\'Pancham\\' (middle octave), 3rd string \\'D’ as \\'Saraj\\' (middle octave), 4th string \\'G’ as \\'Madhyam\\' (lower octave), and 5th string \\'C’ as \\'Komol Nishad\\' (lower octave). From 1960, Rabin Ghosh used \\'Five String Violin\\' starting with his performances at Tansen Sangeet Sanmelan, Calcutta. ==== Resting violin on case ==== Rabin Ghosh\\'s playing style was enriched with the amalgamation of singing as well as tantrakari. He used to use extensive \\'Micro-Tone\\' (application of \\'Shruti\\') to imitate the Indian Singing style. Another distinct feature of his playing style was holding the violin. He used his \\'specially made violin case\\' for resting his violin. He realised that playing could be more comfortable if the instrument is held from the both end facilitating to play finest Meend (sliding), Gamak and other technical applications. Other aspect was to avoid the \\'Excessive Flexion\\' of the vertebral column of the performer, instead of resting violin somewhere of the body. ==== Introduction of Tala ==== Maestro Rabin Ghosh composed \\'Someswara Tala\\' imagining the dancing posture of Nataraj, of 11 Beats, having division of 3 – 2 – 3 – (1.5 + 1.5). == Composition == Going beyond the periphery of performing and teaching Maestro Rabin Ghosh has put his earnest endeavour to compose a few orchestrations on Indian Classical Music. During his tenure in Maihar, when he was completely engulfed in receiving training in Indian Classical Music from Baba Alauddin Khan Saheb, the motif kindled within his heart a unique feeling which prompted him to compose some pieces on Indian Classical Ragas completely orchestrated. The ragas in which he explored himself are Zila Kafi, Bhupali, Kirwani, Khamaj etc. His honest effort to con flux two parallel voices in a composition tuned out to be a grand success. Abhisarika, Niharika, Sanchari and more such compositions shaped between 1973 and 1992 and were staged by his disciples from time to time. A compact disc album named \\'Niharika\\' played by his disciples was released with orchestral works. == Recordings == From 1970 and 1972 The Gramophone Company of India Limited (HMV) released Three Long Playing Discs. The stereo recordings consists solo performance of Raga Pahari Jhinjhoti, Raga Ahir Bhairav by Rabin Ghosh, Raga Gunkali with Himangshu Biswas in Flute, Patdeep (Dhun). HMV released a disk consists of Raga Brindabani Sarang,Raga Bageshree by Rabin Ghosh with Himangshu Biswas (Flute), Dinesh ch. Chandra (Sitar) and Shyamal Bose (Tabla). === Publication === Maestro Rabin Ghosh published a book \\'Swarankan Sanghati\\' – integration of notation system, where he described and analysed the common features as well as comparison and method of translating music between Indian Classical Music Notation System and Western Classical Music Notation System. == Teaching career == Maestro Rabin Ghosh established a new dimension in the field of Indian Classical Music on Violin. As a result, he was associated with Ali Akbar College of Music, Calcutta, Tansen Music College as teacher of violin. Rabin Ghosh was associated with Rabindra Bharati University as lecturer of Instrumental Music Department. He held the position of Examiner for Vishwa Bharati University and for Prayag Sangit Samiti. Maestro Ghosh also gave many Lecture-Demonstrations in various places, including in the Department of Music of Emory University, and Sacramento state University, California, USA. == Awards and achievements == Awarded certificate for standing first in the Baranagar Music Competition on Indian Classical Music by the Baranagar Godhuli Sangha, Calcutta (presently Kolkata), West Bengal in 1946. Awarded certificate for standing first in \\'All Bengal Music Competition\\' on Indian Classical Music.

But Maestro Rabin Ghosh is a musician whose eminence cannot be measured in gold medals and titles alone. His ultimate value in the perfection and sublimity of the music that flows with such easy grace and sweetness from the depths of his heart through his violin to our souls. == References == Ranjan Ghosh \"About me\" The musical legacy of Brahman Baria',\n",

              " 'Thomas Goode snr. JP. (May 1816 – 25 October 1882) (Goode sounds like \\'good\\') was a South Australian merchant closely associated with the Murray River town of Goolwa. == History == Goode was born in the parish of Thornbury, Herefordshire, England, in May 1816. In 1851 he arrived in South Australia, and in 1852 pitched his tent in Goolwa and shortly afterwards built a wooden general store and dwelling house near where the police station later stood. In those days Goolwa was known as \"The Elbow\", and Port Elliot as \"The Knob\", and the few residents were located in huts, the day of houses not having arrived for a locality so far away from the metropolis.Goolwa was at the entrance through the Murray Mouth through which Captain Cadell\\'s steamer the Lady Augusta made its first trip up the river as far as Swan Hill with Governor Young and party, and from where William Randell in Mary Ann made the same trip with little fanfare. The River Murray Steam Navigation Company followed, the tramway to Port Elliot was constructed, and the famous attempt at a breakwater there, later abandoned. It became a major transport hub before the construction of the road network, particularly of wool and wheat. As Goolwa prospered his business grew with it, and necessitated the erection of commodious premises in Cadell Street. In 1873 he took over the business and stock of competitor Emanuel Cohen. Around 1880, with failing health, he gave up the business to his two sons, Thomas and Edward Goode, and retired to his residence \"Thornbury\", a short distance from the township. He suffered considerably before dying, and was buried in the Currency Creek cemetery. In March 1884 the shop was largely destroyed by fire, and was rebuilt within the old walls, which had survived largely intact.In 1952 Thomas Goode & Co. of Goolwa celebrated the 100th year of trading in Goolwa, for most of that time in the same premises, and at that time under the managership of Harold Goode. The shop was still standing in 2011, as a homewares and clothing store \"Chantillie Place\", owned by local resident Peter Smith. == Other interests == Mr Goode was chosen as Goolwa\\'s first mayor, and for a number of years filled the office of Justice of the Peace also. The Southern Agricultural Society many times re-elected him as its President, and he was frequently urged to accept nomination to the House of Assembly, but he always declined. He believed in the practicability of the Goolwa canal scheme (which would have cut a direct route from the town to the sea; a scheme for which a parliamentary Bill was passed but never implemented), and advocated its formation with great energy, gathering a great deal of information and making some valuable diagrams and models illustrating how it could be carried out.In those days of limited populations in country villages medical attendance was a scarce article, but fortunately for Goolwa Mr. Goode had considerable skill and knowledge in surgery and pharmacy (he was a member of the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain), and his advice and medicines were greatly valued, without fee or reward, as many owners of broken legs and arms could testify. == Family == A related Goode family came from Kyre Magna, Worcestershire: Thomas, Charles, Henry Abel, William and Benjamin Powell Goode on the Hope in 1858. William, B. P., H. A. Goode worked a shop at Yankalilla Charles Rufus Goode came out in 1860, Another brother, Matthew arrived on the South Australian in 1868. Two sisters, Ann (about whom little has been found) and Elizabeth (c. 1837 – 28 May 1925) who married a Mr. Porter, had daughter Mrs David Herbertson also migrated to South Australia.Thomas Goode snr. JP. (May 1816 – 25 October 1882) was married to Catharine Goode (died 4 May 1859); they had a daughter Fanny (c. 1855 – 27 January 1911) and two sons: === Tom Goode === Thomas \"Tom\" Goode jun.

              " 'Tri-Valley Transit (formerly ACTR and Stagecoach) is the public transportation provider primarily serving Addison, Orange, and north Windsor Counties in central Vermont. Tri-Valley Transit\\'s mission is to enhance the economic, social and environmental health of the communities it serves by providing public transportation services that are safe, reliable, accessible and affordable. TVT became a 501(c)(3) incorporation in 2017 as the unification of Addison County Transit Resources (ACTR) of Addison County, Vermont, and Stagecoach Transportation Inc. (Stagecoach) of Orange and Northern Windsor Counties, Vermont. Stagecoach was founded in 1976 and ACTR in 1992 by community leaders who recognized that many residents were impeded by a lack of reliable transportation to work, medical appointments and essential errands. == History == In the early days, services focused on elderly residents and were provided by volunteers. Today TVT offers a robust public Shuttle Bus System for everyone and a complementary Dial-A-Ride System for vulnerable residents who cannot access the Bus System. Beginning in 2002, ACTR expanded its bus routes and Dial-A-Ride capacity, growing ridership from 68,000 to more than 174,000 in 2019 and its growth necessitated building the Addison County Community Transportation Center in order to meet future community transportation needs. Over the past two decades, TVT and ACTR have been recognized more than once nationally as a model rural system and locally for community impact. In 2014, ACTR was named the Chamber of Commerce Non-Profit of the Year, while in 2015, Executive Director Jim Moulton was named the nation’s Community Transportation Manager of the Year, and in 2016, Regional Director Bill Cunningham was named Addison County’s Person of the Year. In addition, the Community Transportation Center won awards in 2013 and 2017 for innovative green building design. Based on ACTR’s record of responsible and highly effective community service, the VT Agency of Transportation (VTrans) asked ACTR leadership to enter into a management agreement with Stagecoach in 2014. Stagecoach was in crisis – facing bankruptcy and potential closure. During the three-year management agreement with ACTR, Stagecoach’s debt was paid off, it regained its status as the regional Medicaid Non-Emergency Medical trip provider, general public services were expanded, and community impact nearly doubled (from 61,400 rides in 2014 to nearly 112,600 in 2019). ACTR also benefitted by gaining shared staff, operational efficiencies and cost savings, and a deeper organizational foundation. In 2017, with the management agreement set to expire, the two Boards of Directors recognized the two agencies were stronger together than apart and Tri-Valley Transit was born. With long histories behind them, however, both divisions continued to operate under their original local branding while slowly building the TVT brand. In 2020, TVT began developing a new, unified logo with plans to implement within 3-6 months. In 2019, TVT provided more than 268,000 rides and was on track to deliver approximately 300,000 in 2020 before the COVID-19 pandemic. == Services == Dial-A-Ride programs provide more than 119,000 annual rides to elders, persons with disabilities and Medicaid members. They serve people in more remote towns where Shuttle Buses are not cost efficient. 69 volunteer drivers use their own vehicles to provide rides 7 days-a-week. TVT volunteers give more than 55,000 work hours annually, an in-kind value of almost $600,000. While most trips are provided in-county, they also bring passengers to medical specialists across the state and even occasionally as far as Boston or New York City. In FY19 the Dial-A-Ride System provided 65,500 rides to Medicaid recipients and nearly 83,400 rides to the elderly and disabled. 81% of trips are to medical facilities, 16% to grocery stores or meal sites and 3% elsewhere. Surveyed riders gave TVT Dial-a-Ride a 98% approval rating. Shuttle Bus routes operate 7 days-a-week in densely populated corridors, providing 167,000 rides annually. Every bus in the fleet is equipped with a wheelchair lift, two built-in child seats, seat belts and bike-carrying racks. More than half of the respondents to the 2019 bus rider survey reported a household income below poverty level. They also indicated riding the bus to access work, job training or school (71%), shopping (22%) and medical care (31%). 95% of bus riders say TVT routes get them where they need them to go on time. Trip planning via TVT is also available on Google Maps. Bus riders may also access real-time \"where\\'s my bus\" information with the Transit app on their mobile devices. == Ridership == U.S. Department of Commerce indicates 38% of the region’s population lives below the poverty level, is aged 65 or older or has a disability. These groups are considered “transit-dependent” because of risk indicators for isolation and poor access to the food and medicine. Aging Vermonters need more medical care and may become less fit to drive themselves. The region’s elderly population is growing (from 15% in 2000 to a projected 30% in 2030). Financial pressures create more transit need (VT people living in poverty rose from 9% in 2000 to 11.7% in 2010; and U.S. News & World Report lists Vermonters’ yearly cost of driving at $12,869/year (that’s 23% of VT’s median household income). TVT transportation services allow them to reach all the places needed to live a healthy life. Vermont’s transit-dependent population is growing quickly (from 15% in 2000 to a projected 30% in 2030) and TVT must grow to keep pace with its needs. == References == == External links == Tri-Valley Transit website',\n",
              " 'The nature of the activities of advocacy groups is highly dependent on the scope and extent on group aims and objectives. Motives for advocacy group action may be based on a shared political, religious, moral, health or commercial position. Groups use varied methods to try to achieve their aims including lobbying, media campaigns, publicity stunts, polls, research, and policy briefings. Some groups are supported or backed by powerful business or political interests and exert considerable influence on the political process, while others have few or no such resources. == Letter-writing, petitions and marches == Traditionally, the campaigns of pressure groups have included things such as letter-writing, petitions and marches. For example, in the mid-1980s, LIFE compiled a petition of more than 2,000,000 names opposed to abortion, organised a \"Mail MPs a Mountain\" campaign in 1987 and employed postcard campaigns in 1989 and 1990 against the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990.Marches and demonstrations organised by the Anti-Poll Tax Federation in 1990 were said to have contributed to Margaret Thatcher\\'s resignation as Prime Minister in November that year, and led to the subsequent replacement of the 1989 Community Charge (poll tax) with council tax in 1993. In February 2003, millions took to the streets as part of the Stop the War Coalition\\'s efforts to persuade the government not to deploy US forces in Iraq.In countries such as the United States, petition-signing and letter-writing have been used to good effect at pride marches. These have been influential in the repeal of sodomy laws, support for civil unions and same-sex marriage, and on supporting anti-discrimination legislation. For example, in the 1998 Asbury Park pride march, the New Jersey Lesbian and Gay Coalition distributed postcards to Christine Todd Whitman and to two members of the state assembly asking them to oppose a state version of the Defense of Marriage Act. The Philadelphia Lesbian and Gay Task Force also distributed an \"Update Call to Action\", urging people to make telephone calls to state officials and write letters in support of education reform, revising state education policies and encouraging lawmakers to add sexual orientation and gender identity as protected rights under the Pennsylvania Civil Rights Initiative.Following concerns over a proposed ban on hunting with dogs and lack of concern for rural issues, in 2002 the Countryside Alliance organised \"the march for Liberty and Livelihood\", which allegedly attracted over 400,000 people (including the Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith) and attracted supporters from New Zealand, Australia, Canada, the United States and across Europe. == Directly influencing the legislative process == In most liberal democracies, advocacy groups tend to use the bureaucracy as the main channel of influence – because, in liberal democracies, this is where the decision-making power lies. The aim of advocacy groups here is to attempt to influence a member of the legislature to support their cause by voting a certain way in the legislature. Access to this channel is generally restricted to groups with insider status such as large corporations and trade unions – groups with outsider status are unlikely to be able to meet with ministers or other members of the bureaucracy to discuss policy. What must be understood about groups exerting influence in the bureaucracy is; \"the crucial relationship here [in the bureaucracy] is usually that between the senior bureaucrats and leading business or industrial interests\". This supports the view that groups with greater financial resources at their disposal will generally be better able to influence the decision-making process of government. The advantages that large businesses have is mainly due to the fact that they are key producers within their countries economy and, therefore, their interests are important to the government as their contributions are important to the economy. According to George Monbiot, the influence of big business has been strengthened by \"the greater ease with which corporations can relocate production and investment in a global economy\". This suggests that in the ever modernising world, big business has an increasing role in influencing the bureaucracy and in turn, the decision-making process of government. Core insider groups have the ability to directly influence the formation of government policy at its primary sage through direct consultation with ministers, the civil service and government-appointed bodies working on these legislative proposals. Beyond these core insiders, specialist insider groups may also be called in to give specific information on a particular issue when it is necessary that their point of views or specialist interest is represented in discussions with ministers, the civil service or the government of the day.This consultation may involve informal discussions with relevant departments, or be more structured around a Green Paper Many larger groups employ lobbyists to pursue their legislative goals, and of those the richest groups maintain permanent Westminster offices. In the modern era, it has become more common for groups to employ lobbyists who will use their contacts on behalf of the pressure group in question in exchange for a fee; however, groups whose aims are local and limited in scale may be able to achieve their goals without needing to lobby, in contrast to broader-based groups.In the British cash-for-questions affair, which began when The Guardian newspaper alleged that London\\'s most successful parliamentary lobbyist, Ian Greer of Ian Greer Associates, had bribed two Conservative Members of Parliament in exchange for asking parliamentary questions, and other tasks, on behalf of the Egyptian owner of Harrods department store, Mohamed Al-Fayed. The controversy prompted John Major to instigate the Nolan Committee, to review the issue of standards in public life.Lobbying in the US and in the UK is regulated to stop the worst abuses which can develop into corruption. In the United States the Internal Revenue Service makes a clear distinction between lobbying and advocacy. == Influencing political parties == Advocacy groups can cultivate links with political parties in order to influence policy decisions. This is better done when the party is a party of opposition, as a party in government it will he hindered by time constraints, and policy formation is likely to be \"top-down\", not \"bottom-up\". However, when a party is in opposition, it will be more accepting towards a variety of ideas in order to broaden its support and formulate new policies. During Labour\\'s time in opposition, groups such as Charter 88 and the Electoral Reform Society attempted to cultivate links with the party between 1979 and 1997.Another way groups can cultivate links with political parties is through campaign finance. For instance; in the UK, as the Conservative Party\\'s campaigns are often funded by large corporations, it has been argued that many of its campaigns reflect the interests of businesses. In the United States, George W. Bush\\'s re-election campaign in 2004 was the most expensive in American history and was financed mainly by large corporations and industrial interests that the Bush administration represented in government. Conversely, left-wing parties are often funded by organised labour – when the British Labour Party was formed, it was largely funded by trade unions. Often, political parties are actually formed as a result of group pressure, for example, the Labour Party in the UK was formed out of the new trade-union movement which lobbied for the rights of workers. == Embarking on legal action == The judicial branch of government can also be used by advocacy groups to exert influence, especially in states that have codified constitutions, such as the United States. For example, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) lobbied against the Topeka Board of Education in 1954 (Brown v. Board of Education), arguing that segregation of education based on race was unconstitutional. As a result of group pressure from the NAACP, the supreme court unanimously ruled that racial segregation in education was indeed unconstitutional and such practices were banned. This is a novel example of how advocacy groups can exert influence in the judicial branch of government. Although British courts do not have the same powers of judicial review as the US Supreme Court, litigation has been deemed a successful tactic for British pressure groups. Such action generally works on four levels: Where a court finds that a government has acted ultra vires; Where the rules in place violate EU law or the European Convention on Human Rights; Where an Act of Parliament or action of a public official violates the Human Rights Act 1998; Where litigation raises public awareness of an issue, irrespective of the outcome of the case. For example, the Pro-Life Alliance attempted to use the Human Rights Act to prevent the separation of conjoined twins Jodie and Mary, where it became clear that Mary would die as a result of the procedure, in order to highlight loopholes in the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. == Direct action campaigns == Use of direct action is increasingly popular among pressure groups. The premise of direct group action stems from the concept that traditional methods of influencing government policy are flawed, and that more direct protests, acts of civil disobedience and (in more extreme cases) illegal acts and violence may offer the best opportunity of group success, as they captivate media attention.In the 1970s and 1980s, direct action was often used by gay liberation movements; for example, the Gay Activists Alliance in the United States often used \"zaps\" to gain their objectives. == References ==',\n",

              " 'Streetcars in Los Angeles over history have included horse-drawn streetcars and cable cars, and later extensive electric streetcar networks of the Los Angeles Railway and Pacific Electric Railway and their predecessors. Also included are modern light rail lines. == Horse-drawn streetcars (1874–1897) == Horse-drawn streetcars started with the Spring and Sixth Street Railroad in 1874. Single truck, open air cars traversed unpaved streets. Numerous companies built tracks, with some merging to form larger networks. More railroads of the era included the Main Street and Agricultural Park Railway, the Depot Railway, the City Railroad, and the Central Railroad. The last horsecars were converted to electric in 1897. == Cable cars (1885–1902) == Cable car street railways in Los Angeles first began operating up Bunker Hill in 1885, with a total of three companies operating in the period through 1902, when the lines were electrified and electric streetcars were introduced largely following the cable car routes. There were roughly 25 miles (40 km) of routes, connecting 1st and Main in what was then the Los Angeles Central Business District as far as the communities known today as Lincoln Heights, Echo Park/Filipinotown, and the Pico-Union district. A large viaduct over the Southern Pacific yard operated from 1889 to 1896, colloquially known as the Cape Horn Viaduct. Angel\\'s Flight should not be confused as a cable car because it is a funicular railway operating from Broadway up Bunker Hill. == Electric streetcar systems (1887–1965) == The use of cable traction in Los Angeles was short lived. The Los Angeles Electric Railway began operations in 1887. Electrically-powered streetcar systems were numerous, but were largely consolidated into two large networks. In 1901, Henry Huntington bought various electric streetcar companies operating mostly within the City of Los Angeles (and not in the San Fernando Valley, Harbor area or Westside) and combined them into the Los Angeles Railway with its \"yellow cars\". This system operated with narrow gauge tracks and primarily provided local service along its lines. This was the most popular rail operator in Los Angeles based on passenger numbers. In 1902, Huntington and banker Isaias W. Hellman established the Pacific Electric Railway, which would acquire other railways, providing interurban service to new suburban developments and surrounding towns in what is now Greater Los Angeles (Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino County and Riverside Counties). The company operated distinctive \"red cars\". The explosion of the highway construction and car ownership before and after World War II reduced the demand for passenger rail services, and many lines were controversially converted to bus service by 1955. After being transferred to municipal ownership under the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transit Authority, all former Pacific Electric and Los Angeles Railway services had ended by 1963. Elements of the film Who Framed Roger Rabbit are loosely based on the closure and dismantling of Los Angeles\\' electric streetcars. == LACMTA Metro light rail (1990–present) == The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission was formed to coordinate transit planning in the county. After the passage of Proposition A in 1980, light rail had emerged as a preferred mode for new services. Partially rebuilt on former Pacific Electric corridors, the new rail lines differ from the last generation of services by operating almost entirely in a dedicated right of way without interference from cars. As of 2021, the system consists of four lines: The A Line opened in 1990 as the Blue Line, operating both on city streets in Downtown Los Angeles and Downtown Long Beach, as well as on a dedicated surface and underground rights of way. It is built on a section of the former Pacific Electric Long Beach Line. The C Line opened as the Green Line in 1995. It operated mostly in the median of Interstate 105 between Redondo Beach, the LAX area and Norwalk. The L Line opened as the Gold Line in 2003 and now operates between Downtown L.A. and Azusa in the northeast and East Los Angeles in the southeast. It is planned to be split up and absorbed into the A an E line in the future. The E Line between Downtown L.A. and Santa Monica opened its first section in 2012 as the Expo Line. It operates on a section of the former Santa Monica Air Line.Additional services are planned in the future: The East San Fernando Light Rail Transit Project will reinstate local rail service in the San Fernando Valley, connecting to other Metro services as well as commuter rail and Amtrak services primarily via Van Nuys Boulevard and San Fernando Road. == Historic Downtown LA Streetcar (proposed) == The Historic Downtown Los Angeles Streetcar is a planned local streetcar in Downtown Los Angeles. == See also == Streetcars in San Pedro Streetcars in Long Beach Streetcars in Redlands == References ==',\n",

              " 'Devata (pl: devatas, meaning \\'the gods\\') (Devanagari: देवता; Khmer: ទេវតា (tevoda); Thai: เทวดา (tevada); Javanese, Balinese, Sundanese, Malay: dewata; Batak languages: debata (Toba), dibata (Karo), naibata (Simalungun); diwata (Philippine languages)) are smaller and more focused Devas (Deities) in Indian religions, such as Hinduism and Buddhism. The term \"devata\" itself can also mean deva. They can be either male or female. Every human activity has its devata, its spiritual counterpart or aspect. == Types == There are many kinds of devatas: vanadevatas (forest spirits, perhaps descendants of early nature-spirit cults), gramadevata (village gods), devatas of river crossings, caves, mountains, and so on. For example, in the Konkan region of India, Hindu devatas are often divided into five categories: Grama devatas or village deities who could be the founder deity such as Jathera or ancestral worship of Bali, and examples include Santoshi, Renuka, Aiyanar Sthana devatas or local deities, for example, those in certain places of pilgrimage like Rama in Nasik, Vithoba in Pandharpur, Krishna at Dwarka, Kali at Kolkata, Mahalakshmi at Kolhapur, Devi Kanya Kumari at Kanyakumari Kula devatas or family deities, like Khanderai and Muniandi Ishta devatas or chosen deities Vastu devatas or Gruha devatas, a class of deities that preside over the house.Following are some of the important types of Devatas in Sri Lankan Buddhism: Bandara Devathavo are devatas of trees, mountains, etc. Gambara Devathavo are devatas of the villages Graha Devathavo are devatas of planets == Scriptures == Some well-known Hindu-Buddhist heavenly beings belong to the group of devatas, such as apsaras or vidhyadaris (female cloud and water spirits) and their male counterparts, the gandharvas (heavenly musicians). Devatas often occur in many Buddhist Jatakas, Hindu epics such as the Ramayana and the Mahabharata and in many other Buddhist holy scriptures. The island of Bali is nicknamed Pulau Dewata (Indonesian: \"islands of devata or island of gods\") because of its vivid Hindu culture and traditions. In Indonesia, the term hyang is equivalent to devata. In Hinduism, the devatas that guard the eight, nine and ten cardinal points are called Lokapala (Guardians of the Directions) or, more specifically in ancient Java tradition, Dewata Nawa Sanga (Guardians of Nine Directions). == See also == Demigod Surya Majapahit == References == Palani, Sivasiva. \"New Angles On Angels.\" Hinduism Today, Sep 1992.

              " 'Horde (originally called Beheadoth) is the unblack metal solo project of Australian musician Jayson Sherlock, formerly of Mortification and Paramaecium. In 1994, the only studio album, Hellig Usvart, was released on Nuclear Blast Records. With a session line-up, Horde played live in 2006 in Norway and in 2010 in Finland and Germany. Hellig Usvart proved to be a seminal release for the unblack metal movement, and the album was highly controversial in the secular black metal scene at the time it was released. == History == Sherlock recorded one studio album, Hellig Usvart (\"Holy Unblack\"), under the pseudonym \"Anonymous\" (a possible play on \"Euronymous\", Mayhem guitarist), releasing it on Nuclear Blast in 1994, followed by a later re-release by Rowe Productions. The album title is Norwegian, a fact which led many to believe, while Sherlock was still anonymous, that Horde originated from Norway, a fact backed up by the poor production quality on the album, considered to be a trademark of Norwegian black metal.Upon the initial release of Hellig Usvart, a publicity campaign was launched throughout the black metal community, revolving around Sherlock being credited as \"Anonymous\". Unsuccessful death threats were given to Markus Staiger at Nuclear Blast, who founded the record label, to reveal the identity of the anonymous musician who had created the album, although the identity of the musician was later revealed as Jayson Sherlock. Horde as an entity also received death threats for being a Christian band playing black metal. Upon its original release in 1994, 4,000 copies of the album were printed. In 1999, Rowe Productions purchased the remaining copies and distributed them worldwide. Hellig Usvart was re-released for the album\\'s tenth anniversary in 2004 on Rowe Productions and Soundmass with an additional track entitled \"Mine Heart Doth Beseech Thee (O Master)\", which was originally included on Godspeed: Australian Metal Compilation in 1994 by Rowe Productions and also included on later Soundmass reissues of Hellig Usvart. The album is difficult to come by and sought after by many. In April 2007, a live album, The Day of Total Armageddon Holocaust – Alive in Oslo, was released on Veridon Music and contains the 2006 performance of Horde at Nordic Fest; a video album of the concert was released by the same label on DVD. In May 2008, Polish label Metal Mind Productions released a remaster of Hellig Usvart with three bonus tracks from the 2007 live album. In 2018, Soundmass released Hellig Usvart on vinyl and later reissued it on CD in 2019 for the album\\'s twenty-fifth anniversary. Hellig Usvart pioneered the previously unheard of genre of \"unblack metal\" (sometimes referred to as \"Holy UnBlack Metal\"); since its release, major bands such as A Hill to Die Upon, Antestor, and Crimson Moonlight and minor bands such as Dark Endless (also an unblack metal band with one member) and Hortor have emerged as proponents of Christian unblack metal. The album is satirical of the satanic black metal scene in that it twists common black metal phrases into a Christian ideal. The general message of Hellig Usvart is the destruction and rejection of Satan, in favour of God. There is also direct and indirect praise of God throughout the record. Horde\\'s music is mostly dark, simple, and very fast driving unblack metal-style with high-pitched shrieking or growling vocals. Some tracks, such as \"Invert the Inverted Cross\", utilise double-bass drum work to drive the song. Keyboards are sprinkled in throughout the album as well and appear on such tracks as \"Release and Clothe the Virgin Sacrifice\".Horde gave their first live performance at Nordic Fest in Oslo, Norway on 3 November 2006, with Jayson Sherlock as drummer and vocalist and with help from three members of the Christian unblack metal band Drottnar under the stage names Kvest, Bøddel, and Gestalt. The band played its second live show at Immortal Metal Fest, Finland on 17 April 2010, with the same live line-up as Nordic Fest. According to the festival\\'s website, Sherlock agreed to play the show because the festival celebrated its tenth anniversary. Horde was also announced to play at the Blast of Eternity festival in Germany in November 2010. == Band members == Current membersJayson \"Anonymous\" Sherlock – vocals, drums (1994–present), guitars, bass, keyboards (1994)Live musiciansSimon \"Pilgrim\" Rosen – vocals (2006, 2010) Karl Fredrik \"Kvest\" Lind – guitars (2006, 2010, 2012) Bengt \"Bøddel\" Olsson – guitars (2006, 2010, 2012) Håvar \"Gestalt\" Wormdahl – bass (2006, 2010, 2012)Timeline == Discography == Studio albumsHellig Usvart (1994)Live albumsThe Day of Total Armageddon Holocaust – Alive in Oslo (2007)Video albumsThe Day of Total Armageddon Holocaust – Alive in Oslo (2007) == References == == External links == Rowe Productions',\n",
              " 'King Edward VI High School is a coeducational secondary school and sixth form located in the Highfields area of Stafford, England. The school\\'s sixth form forms part of the Stafford Collegiate. It is a non-selective state school admitting boys and girls from ages 11–18. The school was formed in 1977 following the amalgamation of King Edward VI Boys’ Grammar School and Stafford Girls’ High School. == Introduction == King Edward VI High School serves mainly the west of Stafford to the Shropshire border, and admits students aged between 11 – 19 years. The school catchment area includes Western Downs, the Rowley Avenue area, Forebridge, Doxey, the top end of the Highfields Estate and the villages to the west of Stafford i.e. Bradley, Derrington, Seighford, Haughton, Gnosall, Church Eaton and Woodseaves. The school was formed by merging the long established selective schools, King Edward VI Boys’ Grammar School and Stafford Girls’ High School, in 1977. The selective element was removed in order to create the comprehensive school taking pupils of all abilities. The premises of the Girls’ High School were enlarged and the school was based there. The closure of the old grammar school led to the creation of the independent fee-paying Stafford Grammar School. == School history == === King Edward VI Boys Grammar School === The Free Grammar School of King Edward VI was first established in Stafford in 1550 to provide free education to young boys. In 1862 a new building was erected for the school on Newport Road and would serve as the home of the boys\\' grammar school for well over 100 years. The old King Edward VI building on Newport Road remained in education hands and was turned over to Chetwynd Middle School before later becoming what is now known as the Chetwynd Centre, home of the Stafford Collegiate, where many Post-16 subjects are taught as part of an agreement between the Stafford secondary schools and Stafford College of Further Education. === Stafford Girls\\' High School === Stafford Girls\\' High School was established in 1907 as a grammar school for girls and was based at The Oval, just off the Lichfield Road, with some accommodation for students at The Hough Cottage (now an Italian restaurant). The school later moved to a new site off West Way, close to Stafford Castle; the modern home of King Edward VI High School. In 1977 King Edward VI Grammar School and Stafford Girls\\' High School were amalgamated to create a comprehensive off West Way. === Amalgamation === The two schools merged in September 1976, with King Edwards VI Boys Grammar vacating their site to move to the Stafford Girls\\' High School site off Newport Road. The old girls\\' school buildings on The Oval also remained in education hands, later becoming an art college before being converted into residential apartments. === Recent history === In 2003, Colin Elstone was appointed as Headteacher, serving until 2010 before his retirement. The school achieved its Ofsted status as \"Good with outstanding features\" under his leadership. From 2010 to 2014 the Headteacher was Russell Davis, before the current Headteacher, and former Deputy Headteacher, Jason Christey was appointed in 2015.

It was the first rugby club formed in what is now Northern Ireland and only two other clubs - Dublin University and Wanderers - were formed earlier anywhere else in all Ireland. It was founded in 1868 by members of North of Ireland Cricket Club. NIFC also played in the first recorded rugby game in Ulster when they played a 20-a-side match against Queen\\'s University RFC. Throughout its history, NIFC was one of the most successful clubs in Ulster rugby, winning eighteen Ulster Senior League titles and eighteen Ulster Senior Cup titles. They also played several seasons in the AIB League before merging with Collegians in 1999 to form Belfast Harlequins.The club left its historic home on the Ormeau Road (one of the earliest international rugby venues in Ireland) after a series of sectarian arson attacks, including the burning of its pavilion.

              " 'The Rock \\'n\\' Roll Las Vegas Marathon & 1/2 Marathon is an annual marathon foot-race run on the Las Vegas Strip and in parts of the Las Vegas Valley, Nevada. The 26.2-mile (42.2 km) race was one of the oldest marathons in the United States, having been run between 1967 - 2019. == History == The initial concept was to attract nationally and internationally recognized runners; this was partially successful. Morris Aarbo of Canada won the first year with a time of 2:23:06, ahead of two marathoners from Turkey. A notable participant in the inaugural race was Harry Reid, who at the time was involved with local Nevada government. The subsequent 17 annual races fielded mostly local runners with a sprinkling of national- and international-caliber runners. When the Las Vegas Sun newspaper scuttled its sponsorship of the marathon in 1969, the recently formed Las Vegas Track Club took over the event. Over the ensuing years, enrollment in the race remained low—in the range of 100 to 200 entrants—until the running boom of 1978 when the numbers bumped up for a year or two. Subsequently, entrants again diminished, with fewer than 102 finishers in 1982. In 1983 Al Boka assumed directorship and inaugurated what he expected to be a very fast course. The new course bumped registration up to over 450 participants. However this downhill course proved to be too severe on the runners’ quadriceps, so after three years this route was discontinued. The course was changed to have a smaller vertical drop in 1986. Also beginning in 1986, prize money was offered to 19 age division winners. Later a half marathon was also added to the mix. Boka\\'s strategy to attract more runners was successful; by 1992 enrollment exceeded 2000.Boka remained race director of the Las Vegas Marathon for 23 years until he sold the event in 2005 to Devine Racing, a Chicago-based race organization company, which was also responsible for several other races, including the Los Angeles Marathon. That year the marathon date was changed from January to December after securing Las Vegas Events endorsement along with approval of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. Both organizations were motivated by attracting visitors during the \"slower\" December time period and their consent was necessary for holding any large downtown event. The course was also changed to take place partially in the city. === The Rock \\'n\\' Roll Era === In 2009 the race was acquired by the Competitor Group, Inc. and incorporated into its Rock \\'n\\' Roll Marathon Series and the course was changed for a fourth time since 1982.Since the Competitor Group acquired the race in 2009, the number of full distance (26.219 mi (42.195 km)) marathoners has diminished, while the overall participation has increased dramatically . The venue itself, held at night on the Strip, has become more of a pop culture phenomenon than an international marathon. Most runners elect to do the half marathon while a few run ‘half of the half ‘ or 6.555 mi (10.549 km). Runners in the 2011 event reported illness, overcrowding, and at least one person was hospitalized.In 2014 the overall entrants exceeded 38,000 participants with only 3,208 runners completing the full 26.2 miles. 25,251 runners finished the half-marathon, 2,194 runners completed the 6.555-mile course while the balance ran a 5 kilometer (3.1 mile) race the day before the main event. Many of the short-distance runners were costumed. The Monte Carlo Casino promoted a ‘run-thru wedding’ during the race. While a high volume of entrants is necessary to carry the cost of closing the Las Vegas Strip for more than 12 hours, the paucity of actual marathoners distinguish the Las Vegas event from other big city venues such as Boston, New York, Chicago, London, or Berlin where the number of marathon finishers range from about 20,000 to more than 30,000. While successful as a commercial, for profit venture, this race falls short of the original vision to make the Las Vegas Marathon a world class, competitive running event. In 2017, the race was acquired by and is now organized by the IRONMAN Group, part of Wanda Sports Holdings. Organizers decided not to hold the 2020 edition of the race on its original date in November due to the coronavirus pandemic. Entrants were given either refunds or automatic entry deferral to 2021. == Course == From 1967 to 2004 the marathon course was located on several different routes within Clark County, but outside of downtown Las Vegas. In 1983, Al Boka inaugurated a course that started on State Route 160, high in the Spring Mountains west of Las Vegas on the road to Pahrump, and descended approximately 2,900 feet (883.9m) into the valley, finishing at the Renaissance Center located at the corner of East Tropicana and Eastern Avenues. The 1986 marathon course was changed to a smaller, 700-foot (213.36m) vertical drop. The new route headed north on State Route 604 from Jean NV, paralleling Interstate 15 much of the way, to its finish point at Sunset Park. In 2005, the race course was moved from suburban Clark County to the Las Vegas \"Strip\" and partially in the city of Las Vegas. The loop course between 2005 and 2008 began and finished at Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino. After heading north on Las Vegas Boulevard (The Strip), to the Fremont Street Experience and the Downtown area, the course meandered further northwest of the city and ultimately looped back to the west before reaching Mandalay Bay\\'s parking lot at the finish. The Half Marathon Course remained along the Strip. In its most recent iteration, the full marathon began on Las Vegas Boulevard heading north through the Downtown casino area, proceeded further to the northwest, turns around and finished again on the strip near the Mirage and Venetian Casinos.The event was not held in 2020 or 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was announced in February, 2021 that Competitor group would be next hold their Las Vegas events on February 26 and 27, 2022. The decision was made to move the event due to the increasing difficulty of scheduling closures of the Las Vegas Boulevard that didn\\'t conflict with sporting events involving the Vegas Golden Knights at T-Mobile Arena or the Las Vegas Raiders at Allegiant Stadium. Furthermore, Competitor announced that the Rock \\'n Roll Las Vegas event would no longer offer the full marathon distance, due to poor feedback on the event from prior participants. Competitor will instead offer the half-marathon distance, 10 km and 5 km races. == Winners == Key: Course record (in bold) 1967 — Morris Aarbo: 2:23:06 Las Vegas Sun Marathon (first course) == Notes == == References == List of winnersLeydig, Jack & Milroy, Andy (2011-12-05).

The passengers were returning from the vacation resort of Agadir on a one-stop flight to Paris. All 45 people on Aeroflot Flight 1661 were killed after the plane collided with a weather balloon at an altitude of 5,400 metres (17,700 ft), severing the nose section and sending the plane into an uncontrollable descent. The Antonov An-24B had departed Novosibirsk 25 minutes earlier, at 3:42 a.m., and was bound for Krasnoyarsk. U.S. President Richard M.

Sargent signed the \"War Bill\" passed by both houses of the state legislature the day before. The measure, which passed 127 to 92 in the state House and 29 to 3 in the state Senate declared that no resident of Massachusetts \"shall be required to serve outside of the territorial limits of the United States in the conduct of armed hostilities not an emergency and not otherwise authorized\" by a declaration of war by the U.S. Congress. == April 3, 1970 (Friday) == In South Korea, the Japanese Red Army terrorist group accepted a proposal that Japan\\'s Vice Minister for Transport, Shinjiro Yamamura, take the place of the remaining 100 passengers held captive on Japan Airlines Flight 351. The Boeing 727 jet had been hijacked 79 hours earlier while en route from Tokyo to Fukuoka, and the crew had landed at the Kimpo airfield outside of Seoul rather than acceding to the nine hijackers\\' demand that they be flown to North Korea. The jet then flew onward to the Pyongyang airport in North Korea with Yamamura and the crew of three. Yamamura and flight crew Shinji Isida, Teiichi Esaki and Toshio Aihara were allowed to fly the Boeing 727 from Pyongyang back to Tokyo the next day. Died: Faysal al-Shaabi, 31, Prime Minister of South Yemen during 1969 until being ousted in a coup, was \"shot while trying to escape\" a week after being transferred from house arrest to a government detention camp. == April 4, 1970 (Saturday) == The disposal of the remains of Adolf Hitler was carried out at the Soviet Union\\'s military base in Magdeburg, East Germany. Only the commander of the base was aware that the burnt skeletons of Hitler, Eva Braun, General Hans Krebs, Joseph Goebbels, Magda Goebbels and the Goebbels children, had been interred there. Hitler\\'s skull had been sent to Moscow in 1945, where it was placed in the State Archives in Moscow. In that the base was scheduled to be relinquished to East Germany, the commander consulted KGB Director Yuri Andropov for instructions. To prevent the site from becoming a shrine for neo-Nazis, Andropov ordered that the grave\\'s contents be crushed, burned and scattered. The process was completed the next day at Schönebeck, and what was left over was dumped into the Elbe River. In 1995, the long secret story would be revealed in the book The Death of Hitler: The Full Story with New Evidence from Secret Russian Archives, by Ada Petrova and Peter Watson. In what the Professional Bowlers Association would rank in a 2018 poll as its most dramatic game, Don Johnson had perfection until a frustrating final moment in winning the PBA Tournament of Champions. Johnson had bowled 11 consecutive strikes, but on the 12th and final frame, the \"300 game\" was foiled when only nine of the 10 pins fell. The #10 pin in the upper right corner remained, and although Johnson finished 299 to 268 ahead of his closest challenger, Dick Ritger, the failure to reach 300 cost him a $10,000 bonus and a new car. The 222nd and last original episode of the rural situation comedy Petticoat Junction was telecast, bringing and end to the show after seven seasons that began on September 24, 1963.

Kirk reversed himself the following Sunday, after Judge Krentzman ruled that he was in contempt of court. Krentzman assessed a fine of $10,000 per day (equivalent to more than $66,500 a day fifty years later) to be paid personally by Governor Kirk for every day that he interfered with the court\\'s orders. In the worst killing in California police history, four California Highway Patrol officers were shot and killed while confronting two armed suspects outside a restaurant in Newhall, California. Officers Walt Frago, Roger Gore, George Alleyn, and James Pence were all fatally wounded within four minutes before midnight after Frago and Gore had stopped a car driven by Bobby Davis. A passenger in the car, Jack Twinning, fired the first shots after Frago made his approach to the vehicle, and Gore was killed by Davis. The next day, Twinning killed himself after being cornered by police. Davis was arrested, and eventually hanged himself in prison, 39 years after the killings. Twenty-seven people were treated at the Memorial Hospital of California in Los Angeles for food poisoning after ingesting the hallucinogen LSD on potato chips served at a private party. The 27, eight of whom were admitted, were among 40 who were taken by the Los Angeles County sheriff\\'s department after being called to the festivities at the South Bay Club, a \"singles apartment\" complex for unmarried people in Playa Del Rey, California, where 200 guests were attending a party for a departing tenant. One of the people identified as a guest would later be arrested and sentenced to six years to life in prison after pleading guilty.

The Guatemalan government refused FAR\\'s demand that 22 FAR members be released from prison, along with the payment of US$700,000 in cash, and Spreti was killed by a single gunshot to his head. == April 6, 1970 (Monday) == BBC Radio 4 broadcast the first edition of its long-running evening news programme PM. Photojournalists Sean Flynn of Time magazine, and Dana Stone of CBS, crossed into Cambodia by motorcycle to report on the Vietnam War, and disappeared. Flynn, who was the son of actor Errol Flynn, and Stone were among five journalists who had crossed together for their assignments to take photos and film footage. Captured also were freelance photographer Claude Arpin of France, and two cameramen for Japan\\'s Fuji Commercial Television, Yujiro Takagi and Akira Kusaka. The last time their colleagues saw them was when the men were waved through a roadblock set up by the North Vietnamese Army, which had used Cambodia as a base for operations. In 1986, the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency would declassify a report that had concluded that Flynn and Stone \"probably were executed in 1971 by an officer of the Khmer Rouge\". King Frederik IX of Denmark overturned his Bentley convertible automobile while driving on a Copenhagen street, but was not seriously injured. After climbing out of his car, which skidded on a slippery street, hit the curb and landed on its side\", the King rode part of the way back to the Amalienberg Palace in an ambulance, then asked the driver to stop, got out, and walked the rest of the way, \"apparently wary that his arrival by ambulance might cause alarm.\" Died: Dr. Sam Sheppard, 46, American neurosurgeon who had served 12 years in prison after being wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife; from encephalopathy associated with his consumption of alcohol.

Major League Baseball returned to Milwaukee, as the Milwaukee Brewers played their first game, only seven days after existing as the Seattle Pilots. Milwaukee\\'s previous major team, the Milwaukee Braves, had played their final game on September 12, 1965, before relocating to Atlanta. The Brewers lost to the California Angels, 12 to 0, before a crowd of 36,107 at Milwaukee County Stadium. At the Academy Awards, Midnight Cowboy became the first (and to date, the only) X-rated film to receive the Oscar for Best Picture; John Schlesinger won Best Director. John Wayne received his first and only Oscar for Best Actor, for his performance as Rooster Cogburn in the western True Grit. == April 8, 1970 (Wednesday) == Thirty-four schoolchildren in Egypt were killed, and 42 wounded, when their elementary school was struck by air-to-ground missiles and bombs by F-4 Phantom II jets flown by the Israeli Air Force. The carnage near the city of Faqous, apparently caused by the IAF impression that the building was a military target, was a factor in the ending of Israel\\'s Operation Priha five days later. A huge gas explosion at a subway construction site in Osaka, Japan killed 79 people and injured over 400. The explosions took place at about 5:30 p.m. during the evening rush hour.

Mattingly was removed from the crew and replaced by the backup CM pilot, John L. Swigert Jr. The alternative to lifting off on April 11 with a replacement crew member would have been to postpone the launch to the next favorable launch date, May 9. A pre-launch physical examination showed that Mattingly had contracted rubella (also called German measles) after exposure to the disease from another member of the backup crew, Charles M. Duke Jr. (who, in turn, had contracted the disease from one of his children). With the switch of one state legislator\\'s vote from \"no\" to \"yes\", the New York State House of Representatives cleared the way for legalized abortion in that U.S. state. The State Senate had previously voted, 31 to 26, to pass an even more wide-reaching bill. With 150 members, the State House required at least 76 votes to approve a bill, and the initial roll call vote was 74 to 74, with the House Speaker declining to cast a vote. At that point, Assemblyman George M. Michaels stood up and, crying, told the group that he was changing his vote, adding that \"I cannot go back to my family and say George Michaels killed this bill. I fully appreciate that this is the termination of my career.\" With the vote now 75 in favor, 73 against, Speaker Perry B. Duryea Jr. then added the 76th vote, clearing the way for abortions during the first 24 weeks of pregnancy. As Michaels had predicted, his yes vote did mean the end of his political career and he was never elected to another office. == April 10, 1970 (Friday) == With the page one headline \"PAUL QUITS THE BEATLES\", Britain\\'s national daily tabloid newspaper, the Daily Mirror, broke the story that Paul McCartney was leaving The Beatles. McCartney\\'s parting of ways with John Lennon, and bandmates George Harrison and Ringo Starr, effectively brought a permanent end to the most popular rock musician group in history. McCartney issued a press release later in the day in conjunction with promotional copies of his first album as a solo artist, McCartney. The Autocephalous Orthodox Church in America, the organization of several hundred Russian Orthodox congregations in the United States and Canada, was granted authority to conduct its own affairs (autocephaly) by Patriarch Alexius I and the 14 bishops of the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church.

The center engine of the Saturn S-II stage shut down about 2 minutes and 12 seconds early, but this caused no flight control problems. Born: Trevor Linden, Canadian ice hockey player who had a 19-season career in the NHL; in Medicine Hat, Alberta Died: Cathy O\\'Donnell (stage name for Ann Steely), 46, American film actress; from cancer == April 12, 1970 (Sunday) == Seventeen people were killed and 40 injured near Roseworthy, South Australia, when a double-decker bus was driven at full speed into the path of a train. The driver, who was found to have been intoxicated, apparently did not see the Bluebird railcar train moving down the tracks, and the impact caused the bus to roll over, crushing the upper deck and the people inside. Fifty-two of the surviving 125 crewmen on the Soviet submarine K-8 died when the vessel was flooded with carbon monoxide as they were attempting to extinguish a fire. Four days earlier, eight other crew had been killed when they were sealed off inside sections of the sub during an effort to fight the blaze. The remaining crew had evacuated the sub, but then were ordered to go back inside while it was being towed. After 20 of the 24 nuclear weapons on board were removed, K-8 sank in the Bay of Biscay, 490 kilometres (300 mi) northwest of Spain, with 60 members of the Soviet Navy and four nuclear torpedoes, in waters 15,350 feet (4,680 m) deep. The first major NASCAR event in Alabama, the Alabama 500, was held at the Alabama International Motor Speedway in Talladega. Pete Hamilton, who had won the 1970 Daytona 500 two months earlier, won the Alabama race after leader Buddy Baker was forced out by a car wreck with 13 laps left. Born: Nick Hexum, American musician, frontman of 311, in Madison, Wisconsin == April 13, 1970 (Monday) == At 9:08 in the evening Central Time (April 14 03:08 UTC), the Mission Control team at the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston, Texas, received word from the Apollo 13 crew that an oxygen tank in the command module had exploded, and that electrical power was gradually dropping, an event that led to an abort of the planned lunar landing. The mission shifted to recalculation of the Apollo 13 route in hopes of getting the three astronauts safely back to Earth. Nine minutes after the crew had finished a 40-minute live broadcast to television viewers, astronaut Fred Haise began alerting with the words \"Okay, Houston...\" and Jim Lovell followed with \"I believe we\\'ve had a problem here.\" When ground control asked him to repeat the statement, Lovell said, \"Houston, we\\'ve had a problem.\" Twenty-five years later, the film Apollo 13 would have actor Tom Hanks, as Lovell, saying \"Houston, we have a problem.\" The initial observation was an undervoltage in two of the power-producing cells. After 93 minutes, Haise reported that oxygen pressure in the command module was dropping, and by 10:59 p.m., Mission Control determined that the three LM fuel cells had failed, that only 15 minutes of electrical power remained, and that the crew should transfer immediately to the lunar module. In the village of Xom Bien, a massacre of about 600 ethnic Vietnamese residents of Cambodia was carried out by the Khmer National Army as part of a campaign by the government of Cambodian leader Lon Nol against the nation\\'s Vietnamese-speaking minority. Shortly after midnight, troops entered the village, founded as a Roman Catholic mission on the waters of the Mekong River in the Chrouy Changvar area near Phnom Penh and removed the men and boys, placed them on Vietnamese Navy riverboats, and shot them. Days later, hundreds of the corpses of the victims (which included more from outside of Xom Bien) were seen floating down the Mekong along South Vietnam SS La Jenelle, an idle luxury cruise ship which had formerly been called SS Bahama Star, capsized in a storm as it sat at anchor in the harbor of Port Hueneme, California, and would remain tilted at a 45 degree angle for the next two years before dismantling began in 1972. While stranded in low waters, the ship was boarded by thrillseekers, and the jetty that its remains \"created [is] one of the best surf spots in California\". At the Masters Tournament in Augusta, Georgia, Billy Casper shot a 69 to defeat Gene Littler in an 18-hole playoff to win the championship.

The new nominee, in the wake of the failure of Clement Haynsworth and G. Harrold Carswell to receive confirmation, was Judge Harry A. Blackmun Blackmun would be approved unanimously by the Senate only four weeks later. NASA canceled the scheduled landing of Apollo 13 on the Moon and began new calculations for a course that could swing the spacecraft around the Moon and then bring the command module and lunar module back to Earth. By 9:30 p.m. EST (0230 UTC 15 April), the ship had completed its circuit of the Moon and fired the engines to speed the spacecraft back toward the Earth. Born: Shizuka Kudo, Japanese actress and pop music singer with 11 number one hits on the Oricon Singles Chart; in Hamura, Tokyo == April 15, 1970 (Wednesday) == At 00:21 UTC (7:21 p.m. April 14 Eastern time), the crew of Apollo 13 was partway through its \"slingshot maneuver\" around the far side of the Moon, at an altitude of approximately 158 miles (254 km) above the lunar surface. At that point, astronauts Fred Haise, Jack Swigert, and Jim Lovell had set a record for the furthest distance that human beings had ever traveled away from the Earth. During that time, they were 248,655 miles (400,171 km) above the Earth. Born: Flex Alexander, American actor and comedian; as Mark Alexander Knox in Harlem, New York City Died: Roger Hagberg, 31, American pro football player and running back for the Oakland Raiders since 1965, was killed after being struck by a car in Lafayette, California. == April 16, 1970 (Thursday) == At 1:10 in the morning local time, an avalanche buried a tuberculosis sanatorium in the French Alps near Sallanches, killing 74 people. The avalanche, 600 ft (180 m) wide, swept down the Plateau d\\'Assy and struck the children\\'s wing of the hospital and two nursing dormitories, with a 60 ft (18 m) wide wall of snow. Most of the dead were boys under the age of 15, who were asleep when the disaster struck. Two Protestant ministers with views regarding majority rule in Northern Ireland, were elected to the Stormont, the House of Commons of Northern Ireland. Reverend Ian Paisley and his assistant, Reverend William Beattie, both of the Unionist Party, defeated Labour candidates in a by-election to fill the vacancies. The National Basketball Players Association and its attorney and executive director, Larry Fleisher, filed an antitrust lawsuit to prevent a possible merger between the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the rival American Basketball Association (ABA), until a guarantee could be assured for free agency for the players of a merged league. Filed in the name of NBAPA President (and NBA point guard) Oscar Robertson against the 11 ABA and 17 NBA team owners, the lawsuit averred that a single 28-team league would prevent players from being able to negotiate with the highest bidder between the rival circuits. A partial merger would finally take place in 1976, after a court ruling to void the reserve clause in contracts that gave teams the first option to renew a player\\'s contract, and an 18-team NBA would bring in four of the remaining ABA teams. Died: Richard Neutra, 78, Austrian-American architect == April 17, 1970 (Friday) == Apollo 13 splashed down safely in the South Pacific Ocean near American Samoa, and was recovered by the amphibious assault ship USS Iwo Jima.

Jim Lovell, Fred Haise and Jack Swigert were told by Nixon, \"You did not reach the Moon but you reached the hearts of millions of people on Earth by what you did.\" Born: Saad Hariri, Prime Minister of Lebanon from 2009 to 2011 and again from 2016 to 2020; as the son of Lebanese politician (and later Prime Minister) Rafic Hariri in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Heike Friedrich, East German swimmer who held the women\\'s record for the 200m freestyle from 1986 to 1994; winner of two gold medals in the 1988 Summer Olympics and four in the 1986 world championships Died: Michał Kalecki, 70, Polish economist and neo-Marxian economics theorist == April 19, 1970 (Sunday) == Elections were held in Colombia for a new president and for the Senate and the Chamber of Representatives. Pursuant to an agreement that Colombia\\'s Conservative Party and Liberal Party would alternate control of the presidency, all four of the candidates were from factions of the Conservative Party, and none won a majority. Misael Pastrana Borrero, formerly Colombia\\'s ambassador to the United States, received 1,625,025 votes (40.7%) of those cast. His closest challenger, former President Gustavo Rojas Pinilla of the ANAPO (Alianza Nacional Popular, the National Popular Alliance) faction, had 1,561,468 or 39.1% of the votes. Charging fraud, Rojas Pinilla threatened to capture the presidency by force (as he had done in a 1953 military coup) and President Carlos Lleras Restrepo placed the country under martial law the next day In advance of the centennial of the April 22, 1870 birth of Vladimir Lenin, a 62 ft (19 m) high statue of the father of Communism, Lenin, was dedicated in East Berlin\\'s Leninplatz. East Germany\\'s Prime Minister and Communist Party general secretary, Walter Ulbricht, told a crowd of tens of thousands that the monument would remind Germans of the more than 300,000 Soviet soldiers who died in the battle for Berlin in 1945. The granite statue would be dismantled, removed and buried in 1992, after the reunification of Germany, the head would be unearthed in 2015 for a display in an exhibition. The first Lada compact car, the initial offering of the Soviet Union\\'s AvtoVAZ automobile company, rolled off the assembly line of the Volga Automotive Plant in the city of Tolyatti, in the Russian SFSR. The original model, the VAZ-2101, was marketed in Eastern Europe as the \"Zhiguli\", and in the rest of the world as the \"Lada 2101\". The first intercontinental World Cup Rally (so called because the destination from London was the city where the quadrennial FIFA World Cup was scheduled) began at Wembley Stadium as 50,000 spectators watched the start of the 1970 London to Mexico World Cup Rally, sponsored by the London Daily Mirror tabloid. The 96 drivers (from 22 nations) drove through London and on to Dover to board the ferry across the English Channel to continental Europe, with a route going through Europe, Africa and South America before proceeding through Central America. The Ford Escort team of Finland\\'s Hannu Mikkola and Sweden\\'s Gunnar Palm arrived first in Mexico City, on May 27 Born: Luis Miguel (stage name for Luis Miguel Gallego), U.S.-born Mexican pop singer and one of the most successful recording artists in Latin American history; in San Juan, Puerto Rico == April 20, 1970 (Monday) == U.S. President Nixon announced that he would order the withdrawal of 150,000 American troops from South Vietnam over the next 12 months as part of the process of turning conduct of the Vietnam War over to the South Vietnamese people. Ten days after declaring that \"The decision I have announced tonight means that we have in sight the just peace we are seeking\", Nixon reversed the decision and announced that troop strength would not be decreased and that the war would expand into Cambodia. Hanoi and the Viet Cong had been given ample warning that they ran the risk of South Vietnamese and United States military action in Cambodia if they continued to mount attacks from neutral Cambodia as well as threatening the Lon Nol government. A new comic strip, Broom-Hilda, began its daily run in 69 American daily newspapers as one of the offerings of the Chicago Tribune Syndicate. Featuring a broom-riding witch as its title character, the strip is still drawn by cartoonist Russell Myers more than 49 years later. While Sunday, April 19, 1970, is sometimes listed as the date of the first strip, the appearance was limited to an advertisement in the Sunday comics section of the Chicago Tribune where Broom-Hilda told readers \"My friends and I will be in the Tribune every day, starting tomorrow. Come and see us.\" The New York Knicks overwhelmed the Milwaukee Bucks, 132 to 96, to win Game 5 of a best-4-of-7 semifinal and to earn the right to face the Los Angeles Lakers in the National Basketball Association championship series. The Lakers had won the NBA\\'s Western Division crown the day before against the Atlanta Hawks. Less than two weeks after the U.S. Senate declined to approve his nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court, G. Harrold Carswell resigned his lifetime appointment as a federal judge, apparently confident that he could win office as a United States Senator for Florida. Carswell failed to become the Republican Party nominee, losing by a wide margin in the September 8 primary to Congressman William C. Cramer. Born: Adriano Moraes, Brazilian professional bull rider with four world titles in professional rodeo; in Quintana, São Paulo Shemar Moore, American television actor known for The Young and the Restless; in Oakland == April 21, 1970 (Tuesday) == All 36 people on Philippine Airlines Flight 215 were killed in a crash caused by a bomb explosion in the aircraft\\'s restroom at an altitude of 10,500 feet (3,200 m). The Hawker Siddeley HS-748 had departed from Cauayan on a 174 mi (280 km) flight to Manila. Leonard Casley, a disgruntled wheat farmer in the state of Western Australia, declared his 18,500-acre (7,500 ha) farm to be the \"Hutt River Province\", and would contend for the rest of his life that his 29 sq mi (75 km2) of territory had seceded from Australia and was no longer subject to national or state laws. A little more than a year later, Casley began making money by arranging to have postage stamps printed for sale to collectors and tourists. Funded by tourism for his micronation, Casley began referring to himself as \"Prince Leonard of Hutt River\" and expanded to minting coins and printing currency. Casley died on February 13, 2019, two years after abdicating his throne to his son Graeme Casley. Born: Rob Riggle, American comedian known for Saturday Night Live; also a Lieutenant Colonel in the U.S. Marines reserve; in Louisville, Kentucky Nicole Sullivan, American comedian and actress known for MADtv and for The King of Queens; in Los Angeles == April 22, 1970 (Wednesday) == Earth Day was celebrated in the United States for the first time. The Associated Press reported the next day, \"Across the nation, trash was gathered, streets swept, ponds and parks cleaned, trees and flowers planted\" as \"youth joined hands with age across the generation gap\". In a secret meeting at the White House of his National Security Council, U.S. President Richard M. Nixon discussed the options for the United States response to the continuing use of Cambodia by the North Vietnamese Army and the Viet Cong as a base from which to launch attacks against American forces during the Vietnam War. Nixon\\'s chief national security adviser, Henry Kissinger, would recount later that the three choices were to continue the current response, favored by Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird and Secretary of State William P. Rogers; providing financial and adviser aid to an invasion by South Vietnam\\'s army without committing ground troops (favored by Kissinger); or sending U.S. troops and planes into Cambodia to attack Communist sanctuaries (favored by General Earle Wheeler, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff). While Nixon supported Kissinger\\'s option, U.S. Vice President Spiro T. Agnew made the argument for committing U.S. troops to Cambodia, the decision that Nixon ultimately adopted. A non-violent protest created Chicano Park in San Diego, California, when college student Mario Solis saw construction crews preparing to clear a popular gathering place to build a new California Highway Patrol station in a majority Hispanic-American section of the city, Barrio Logan. Much of the neighborhood had already been razed to build Interstate Highway 5 and the San Diego–Coronado Bridge. Solis quickly organized the occupation of the site by 300 neighborhood residents, and the city of San Diego and the state relented after a 12-day standoff, allowing the residents to build their own park Born: Regine Velasquez, best-selling Philippine singer and award-winning actress; in Manila == April 23, 1970 (Thursday) == The tiny European co-principality of Andorra granted women the right to vote. The decree provided the franchise to 1,300 women in the nation, located in the Pyrenees on the border between Spain and France. It was signed by its joint heads of state, Spain\\'s Bishop of Urgell (Joan Martí i Alanis) and by Martí\\'s fellow co-prince, France\\'s President Georges Pompidou. Women were still ineligible, however, to run for office.

The 346 lb (157 kg) spacecraft, named for revolutionary song \"The East Is Red\", which it transmitted continuously while making an orbit of the Earth every 114 minutes. Chiang Ching-kuo, the future President of the Republic of China (on the island of Taiwan), was shot at by a would-be assassin as he entered the Plaza Hotel in New York City. A plainclothes officer of the New York City Police Department struck the assassin\\'s arm and the deflected shot struck the hotel\\'s revolving door as Chiang was preparing to enter. The shooter, Peter Huang Wen-hsiung, was a Ph.D. candidate at Cornell University. He and his brother-in-law, Cheng Tzu-tsai, were arrested at the scene. Chiang, the son, and eventual successor, of Taiwanese President Chiang Kai-shek was the Vice-Premier of the island republic at the time. Cheng and Huang fled the United States after being released on bail and, after Chiang Ching-kuo\\'s 1988 passing, would return to Taiwan in 1996. The West African nation of Gambia became a republic shortly before midnight, after certification of the results of a four day long referendum; Gambian voters approved the measure by more than the required two-thirds needed under the former British colony\\'s constitution, with 84,968 in favor and 35,638 against The 452nd and final episode of the American western anthology series Death Valley Days was shown on syndicated television, bringing an end to the program after 18 seasons. The series had been broadcast at different times by American television stations since October 1, 1952. == April 25, 1970 (Saturday) == A mutiny of the Trinidanian Army came to a peaceful end after five days, when the government of Trinidad and Tobago negotiated a surrender of the mutineers in return for amnesty. On Tuesday, soldiers in Chaguaramas had seized the Teteron Barracks in the small Caribbean nation. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a warning, to 400,000 owners of the \"Relaxacizor\", that the machine, marketed as an electrical weight-loss device, could seriously injure or even kill its users because of its process of \"exercising\" specific muscles with electric shocks to stimulate muscle contraction. On April 14, a federal court had issued an injunction to the Eastwood General Corporation, prohibiting future sales unless the Relaxacisor was prescribed by a physician, but the order did not affect the units already sold.

Francisco Cunha Leal, 81, Prime Minister of Portugal for seven weeks in 1920 and 1921 == April 27, 1970 (Monday) == A five-member team of physicists at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in Berkeley, California, led by Albert Ghiorso, reported that they had synthesized a new chemical element (now called Dubnium) number 105 on the periodic table At the same time, the California team disputed a 1968 report from a Soviet team at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, outside of Moscow, that the Soviets had synthesized the element first. The IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party, convened by the international unions of pure and applied chemistry and of physics, would later credit both teams with the discovery. Ghiorso\\'s team had bombarded californium-249 (an isotope of element number 98) with ions of an isotope of nitrogen and concluded that it had created an isotope of 105. An unidentified 58-year-old woman became the first person to receive a heart pacemaker to be powered by an atomic battery, in a four-hour operation at the Hôpital Broussais in Paris.

Previously, under the 1907 papal decree Ne Temere, the non-Catholic husband or wife had to promise to raise any children in the Catholic faith. The new rules eliminated the promise, but did require that the Roman Catholic partner had to promise to do everything in their power \"to have all the children baptized and brought up in the Catholic Church\" as a prerequisite for the marriage to be recognized by the Church, and for the non-Catholic partner to state understanding of the Catholic obligation. The new rules were to take effect on October 1.

              " 'Ruben Lenten (born 30 March 1988) is a Dutch professional kite surfer who has won the Red Bull King of the Air in 2005. Ruben started kiteboarding at the age of 12 and quickly made a name for himself as a rider who was willing to push the sport hard and take that extra risk out on the water. For a number of years Ruben competed on the PKRA freestyle world tour with a second position overall in 2005 as his best ranking.Ruben was one of the first riders to try radical high-powered moves in gale force conditions, easily jumping over 15 m high. One of his signature moves has become the megaloop, where the kite is steered around in a tight circle while the rider is up really high in the air. (see photo link below) In recent years Ruben has moved away from the competition scene and focused on other projects like producing kiteboarding movies and creating and organizing new kiteboarding concepts and events like the LEN10 Megaloop challenge. Ruben was instrumental in developing a new competition format that caters more to the public, featuring an easy to follow scoring system and higher and more spectacular jumps. Ruben did take part in the 2014 and 2015 King of the Air competitions in South Africa. He came in third in 2014 but crashed hard in this years final, dislocating his hand in the aftermath. Together with other accomplished riders like Aaron Hadlow and Robby Naish Ruben is currently working on a project that strives to really put the kiteboarding industry on the map by making the biggest kiteboard movie to date. Ruben has worked with Aaron Hadlow in the past. Together they partnered with RedBull to make a web series called \"On the Loose\". Ruben is currently sponsored by Ozone and Mystic. == External links == Ruben\\'s personal homepage Ruben Lenten photos == References ==',\n",

              " 'David Storr Unwin (3 December 1918 – 11 February 2010), known as David Severn, was a British writer. He was the son of publisher Sir Stanley Unwin, of whom Severn wrote a biography in 1982, Fifty Years with Father. He had Who\\'s Who entries throughout his writing career. Severn attended Abbotsholme School, Derbyshire, 1933–36, and worked for the League of Nations Secretariat, Geneva (1938), Unwin Brothers (printers), 1939, Blackwells (1940) and George Allen & Unwin (1941–43), having been declared medically unfit for the armed services. His first series for children (1942–46) featured \"Crusoe\" Robinson, who was befriended by youngsters in holiday adventures, many featuring a Romany group. The Warner family series followed (1947–52), featuring pheasants, ponies and country life. The scraperboard illustrations of Joan Kiddell-Monroe greatly enhance these two series. A number of books experimented with the paranormal and time-slip, and can be compared with many modern books revisiting supernatural themes. Drumbeats! has a musical youngster beating a native drum which transports children to a lost expedition to Africa twenty years earlier. Dream Gold shows the hypnotic power of one boy over another, with dreams reliving the conflicts of their ancestors. These are his most interesting books, and the ones he wished to be remembered by. The Future Took Us is a time-slip into 3,000 C.E. The Girl in the Grove, his longest book, is a psychological ghost story. He also produced illustrated books for younger children. Only his last three books were published by Allen & Unwin. == Books for children as David Severn == (Published in London by The Bodley Head unless indicated, selected titles in New York by Houghton Mifflin 1946–47 and thereafter Macmillan.
