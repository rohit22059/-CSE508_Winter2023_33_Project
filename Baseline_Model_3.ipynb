            "thomas woodrow wilson december 28 1856 february 3 1924 was an american politician and academic who served as the 28th president of the united states from 1913 to 1921 a member of the democratic party wilson served as the president of princeton university and as the governor of new jersey before winning the 1912 presidential election as president wilson changed the nations economic policies and led the united states into world war i in 1917 he was the leading architect of the league of nations and his progressive stance on foreign policy came to be known as wilsonianism wilson grew up in the american south mainly in augusta georgia during the civil war and reconstruction after earning a phd in history and political science from johns hopkins university wilson taught at various colleges before becoming the president of princeton university and a spokesman for progressivism in higher education as governor of new jersey from 1911 to 1913 wilson broke with party bosses and won the passage of several progressive reforms to win the presidential nomination he mobilized progressives and southerners to his cause at the 1912 democratic national convention wilson defeated incumbent republican william howard taft and thirdparty nominee theodore roosevelt to easily win the 1912 united states presidential election becoming the first southerner to do so since 1848 during his first year as president wilson authorized the widespread imposition of segregation inside the federal bureaucracy his first term was largely devoted to pursuing passage of his progressive new freedom domestic agenda his first major priority was the revenue act of 1913 which lowered tariffs and began the modern income tax wilson also negotiated the passage of the federal reserve act which created the federal reserve system two major laws the federal trade commission act and the clayton antitrust act were enacted to promote business competition and combat extreme corporate power at the outbreak of world war i in 1914 the us declared neutrality as wilson tried to negotiate a peace between the allied and central powers he narrowly won reelection in the 1916 united states presidential election boasting how he kept the nation out of wars in europe and mexico in april 1917 wilson asked congress for a declaration of war against germany in response to its policy of unrestricted submarine warfare that sank american merchant ships wilson nominally presided over wartime mobilization and left military matters to the generals he instead concentrated on diplomacy issuing the fourteen points that the allies and germany accepted as a basis for postwar peace he wanted the offyear elections of 1918 to be a referendum endorsing his policies but instead the republicans took control of congress after the allied victory in november 1918 wilson went to paris where he and the british and french leaders dominated the paris peace conference wilson successfully advocated for the establishment of a multinational organization the league of nations it was incorporated into the treaty of versailles that he signed wilson had refused to bring any leading republican into the paris talks and back home he rejected a republican compromise that would have allowed the senate to ratify the versailles treaty and join the league wilson had intended to seek a third term in office but suffered a severe stroke in october 1919 that left him incapacitated his wife and his doctor controlled wilson and no significant decisions were made meanwhile his policies alienated german and irish democrats and the republicans won a landslide in the 1920 presidential election scholars have generally ranked wilson in the upper tier of us presidents although he has been criticized for supporting racial segregation his liberalism nevertheless lives on as a major factor in american foreign policy and his vision of ethnic selfdetermination resonated globally early life thomas woodrow wilson was born to a family of scotsirish and scottish descent in staunton virginia he was the third of four children and the first son of joseph ruggles wilson and jessie janet woodrow wilsons paternal grandparents had immigrated to the united states from strabane county tyrone ireland in 1807 settling in steubenville ohio his grandfather james wilson published a protariff and antislavery newspaper the western herald and gazette wilsons maternal grandfather reverend thomas woodrow moved from paisley renfrewshire scotland to carlisle cumbria england before migrating to chillicothe ohio in the late 1830s joseph met jessie while she was attending a girls academy in steubenville and the two married on june 7 1849 soon after the wedding joseph was ordained as a presbyterian pastor and assigned to serve in staunton thomas was born in the manse a house of the staunton first presbyterian church where joseph served before he was two the family moved to augusta georgia wilsons earliest memory was of playing in his yard and standing near the front gate of the augusta parsonage at the age of three when he heard a passerby announce in disgust that abraham lincoln had been elected and that a war was coming wilson was one of only two us presidents to be a citizen of the confederate states of america the other being john tyler wilsons family identified with the southern united states and were staunch supporters of the confederacy during the american civil warwilsons father was one of the founders of the southern presbyterian church in the united states pcus after it split from the northern presbyterians in 1861 he became minister of the first presbyterian church in augusta and the family lived there until 1870 from 1870 to 1874 wilson lived in columbia south carolina where his father was a theology professor at the columbia theological seminary in 1873 wilson became a communicant member of the columbia first presbyterian church he remained a member throughout his lifewilson attended davidson college in north carolina for the 187374 school year but transferred as a freshman to the college of new jersey now princeton university he studied political philosophy and history joined the phi kappa psi fraternity and was active in the whig literary and debating society he was also elected secretary of the schools football association president of the schools baseball association and managing editor of the student newspaper in the hotly contested presidential election of 1876 wilson declared his support for the democratic party and its nominee samuel j tilden after graduating from princeton in 1879 wilson attended the university of virginia school of law where he was involved in the virginia glee club and served as president of the jefferson literary and debating society after poor health forced his withdrawal from the university of virginia he continued to study law on his own while living with his parents in wilmington north carolina wilson was admitted to the georgia bar and made a brief attempt at establishing a law firm in atlanta in 1882 though he found legal history and substantive jurisprudence interesting he abhorred the daytoday procedural aspects after less than a year he abandoned his legal practice to pursue the study of political science and history marriage and family in 1883 wilson met and fell in love with ellen louise axson the daughter of a presbyterian minister from savannah georgia he proposed marriage in september 1883 she accepted but they agreed to postpone marriage while wilson attended graduate school ellen graduated from art students league of new york worked in portraiture and received a medal for one of her works from the exposition universelle 1878 in paris she agreed to sacrifice further independent artistic pursuits in order to marry wilson in 1885 she learned german so that she could help translate works of political science that were relevant to wilsons research their first child margaret was born in april 1886 and their second jessie in august 1887 their third and final child eleanor was born in october 1889 in 1913 jessie married francis bowes sayre sr who later was high commissioner to the philippines in 1914 eleanor married william gibbs mcadoo the secretary of the treasury under wilson and later a senator for california academic career professor in late 1883 wilson enrolled at the recently established johns hopkins university in baltimore for doctoral studies built on the humboldtian model of higher education johns hopkins was inspired particularly from germanys historic heidelberg university in that it was committed to research as a central part of its academic mission wilson studied history political science german and other areas wilson hoped to become a professor writing that a professorship was the only feasible place for me the only place that would afford leisure for reading and for original work the only strictly literary berth with an income attached wilson spent much of his time at johns hopkins writing congressional government a study in american politics which grew out of a series of essays in which he examined the workings of the federal government he received a phd in history and government from johns hopkins in 1886 making him the only us president who has possessed a phd in early 1885 houghton mifflin published congressional government which received a strong reception one critic called it the best critical writing on the american constitution which has appeared since the federalist papersin 1885 to 1888 wilson accepted a teaching position at bryn mawr college a newly established womens college near philadelphia wilson taught ancient greek and roman history american history political science and other subjects there were only 42 students nearly all of them too passive for his taste m carey thomas the dean was an aggressive feminist and wilson was in a bitter dispute with the president about his contract he left as soon as possible and was not given a farewellin 1888 wilson left bryn mawr for wesleyan university in connecticut an elite undergraduate college for men he coached the football team founded a debate team and taught graduate courses in political economy and western historyin february 1890 with the help of friends wilson was appointed by princeton to the chair of jurisprudence and political economy at an annual salary of 3000 equivalent to 90478 in 2021 he quickly gained a reputation as a compelling speaker in 1896 francis landey patton announced that the college of new jersey would henceforth be known as princeton university an ambitious program of expansion followed with the name change in the 1896 presidential election wilson rejected democratic nominee william jennings bryan as too far to the left he supported the conservative gold democrat nominee john m palmer wilsons academic reputation continued to grow throughout the 1890s and he turned down multiple positions elsewhere including at johns hopkins and the university of virginiawilson published several works of history and political science and was a regular contributor to political science quarterly wilsons textbook the state was widely used in american college courses until the 1920s in the state wilson wrote that governments could legitimately promote the general welfare by forbidding child labor by supervising the sanitary conditions of factories by limiting the employment of women in occupations hurtful to their health by instituting official tests of the purity or the quality of goods sold by limiting the hours of labor in certain trades and by a hundred and one limitations of the power of unscrupulous or heartless men to outdo the scrupulous and merciful in trade or industry he also wrote that charity efforts should be removed from the private domain and made the imperative legal duty of the whole a position which according to historian robert m saunders seemed to indicate that wilson was laying the groundwork for the modern welfare state his third book division and reunion 1893 became a standard university textbook for teaching mid and late19th century us history president of princeton university in june 1902 princeton trustees promoted professor wilson to president replacing patton whom the trustees perceived to be an inefficient administrator wilson aspired as he told alumni to transform thoughtless boys performing tasks into thinking men he tried to raise admission standards and to replace the gentlemans c with serious study to emphasize the development of expertise wilson instituted academic departments and a system of core requirements students were to meet in groups of six under the guidance of teaching assistants known as preceptors to fund these new programs wilson undertook an ambitious and successful fundraising campaign convincing alumni such as moses taylor pyne and philanthropists such as andrew carnegie to donate to the school wilson appointed the first jew and the first roman catholic to the faculty and helped liberate the board from domination by conservative presbyterians he also worked to keep african americans out of the school even as other ivy league schools were accepting small numbers of black peoplewilsons efforts to reform princeton earned him national notoriety but they also took a toll on his health in 1906 wilson awoke to find himself blind in the left eye the result of a blood clot and hypertension modern medical opinion surmises wilson had had a strokehe later was diagnosed as his father had been with hardening of the arteries he began to exhibit his fathers traits of impatience and intolerance which would on occasion lead to errors of judgment when wilson began vacationing in bermuda in 1906 he met a socialite mary hulbert peck according to biographer august heckscher ii wilsons friendship with peck became the topic of frank discussion between wilson and his wife although wilson historians have not conclusively established there was an affair wilson also sent very personal letters to her which were later used against him by his adversarieshaving reorganized the schools curriculum and established the preceptorial system wilson next attempted to curtail the influence of social elites at princeton by abolishing the upperclass eating clubs he proposed moving the students into colleges also known as quadrangles but wilsons quad plan was met with fierce opposition from princetons alumni in october 1907 due to the intensity of alumni opposition the board of trustees instructed wilson to withdraw the quad plan late in his tenure wilson had a confrontation with andrew fleming west dean of the graduate school and also wests ally expresident grover cleveland who was a trustee wilson wanted to integrate a proposed graduate school building into the campus core while west preferred a more distant campus site in 1909 princetons board accepted a gift made to the graduate school campaign subject to the graduate school being located off campuswilson became disenchanted with his job due to the resistance to his recommendations and he began considering a run for office prior to the 1908 democratic national convention wilson dropped hints to some influential players in the democratic party of his interest in the ticket while he had no real expectations of being placed on the ticket he left instructions that he should not be offered the vice presidential nomination party regulars considered his ideas politically as well as geographically detached and fanciful but the seeds had been sown in 1956 mcgeorge bundy described wilsons contribution to princeton wilson was right in his conviction that princeton must be more than a wonderfully pleasant and decent home for nice young men it has been more ever since his time governor of new jersey 19111913 by january 1910 wilson had drawn the attention of james smith jr and george brinton mcclellan harvey two leaders of new jerseys democratic party as a potential candidate in the upcoming gubernatorial election having lost the last five gubernatorial elections new jersey democratic leaders decided to throw their support behind wilson an untested and unconventional candidate party leaders believed that wilsons academic reputation made him the ideal spokesman against trusts and corruption but they also hoped his inexperience in governing would make him easy to influence wilson agreed to accept the nomination if it came to me unsought unanimously and without pledges to anybody about anythingat the state party convention the bosses marshaled their forces and won the nomination for wilson he submitted his letter of resignation to princeton on october 20 wilsons campaign focused on his promise to be independent of party bosses he quickly shed his professorial style for more emboldened speechmaking and presented himself as a fullfledged progressive though republican william howard taft had carried new jersey in the 1908 presidential election by more than 82000 votes wilson soundly defeated republican gubernatorial nominee vivian m lewis by a margin of more than 65000 votes democrats also took control of the general assembly in the 1910 elections though the state senate remained in republican hands after winning the election wilson appointed joseph patrick tumulty as his private secretary a position he held throughout wilsons political careerwilson began formulating his reformist agenda intending to ignore the demands of his party machinery smith asked wilson to endorse his bid for the us senate but wilson refused and instead endorsed smiths opponent james edgar martine who had won the democratic primary martines victory in the senate election helped wilson position himself as an independent force in the new jersey democratic party by the time wilson took office new jersey had gained a reputation for public corruption the state was known as the mother of trusts because it allowed companies like standard oil to escape the antitrust laws of other states wilson and his allies quickly won passage of the geran bill which undercut the power of the political bosses by requiring primaries for all elective offices and party officials a corrupt practices law and a workmens compensation statute that wilson supported won passage shortly thereafter for his success in passing these laws during the first months of his gubernatorial term wilson won national and bipartisan recognition as a reformer and a leader of the progressive movementrepublicans took control of the state assembly in early 1912 and wilson spent much of the rest of his tenure vetoing bills nonetheless he won passage of laws that restricted labor by women and children and increased standards for factory working conditions a new state board of education was set up with the power to conduct inspections and enforce standards regulate districts borrowing authority and require special classes for students with handicaps before leaving office wilson oversaw the establishment of free dental clinics and enacted a comprehensive and scientific poor law trained nursing was standardized while contract labor in all reformatories and prisons was abolished and an indeterminate sentence act passed a law was introduced that compelled all railroad companies to pay their employees twice monthly while regulation of the working hours health safety employment and age of people employed in mercantile establishments was carried out shortly before leaving office wilson signed a series of antitrust laws known as the seven sisters as well as another law that removed the power to select juries from local sheriffs presidential election of 1912 democratic nomination wilson became a prominent 1912 presidential contender immediately upon his election as governor of new jersey in 1910 and his clashes with state party bosses enhanced his reputation with the rising progressive movement in addition to progressives wilson enjoyed the support of princeton alumni such as cyrus mccormick and southerners such as walter hines page who believed that wilsons status as a transplanted southerner gave him broad appeal though wilsons shift to the left won the admiration of many it also created enemies such as george brinton mcclellan harvey a former wilson supporter who had close ties to wall street in july 1911 wilson brought william gibbs mcadoo and colonel edward m house in to manage the campaign prior to the 1912 democratic national convention wilson made a special effort to win the approval of threetime democratic presidential nominee william jennings bryan whose followers had largely dominated the democratic party since the 1896 presidential electionspeaker of the house champ clark of missouri was viewed by many as the frontrunner for the nomination while house majority leader oscar underwood of alabama also loomed as a challenger clark found support among the bryan wing of the party while underwood appealed to the conservative bourbon democrats especially in the south in the 1912 democratic party presidential primaries clark won several of the early contests but wilson finished strong with victories in texas the northeast and the midwest on the first presidential ballot of the democratic convention clark won a plurality of delegates his support continued to grow after the new york tammany hall machine swung behind him on the tenth ballot tammanys support backfired for clark as bryan announced that he would not support any candidate that had tammanys backing and clark began losing delegates on subsequent ballots wilson gained the support of roger charles sullivan and thomas taggart by promising the vice presidency to governor thomas r marshall of indiana and several southern delegations shifted their support from underwood to wilson wilson finally won twothirds of the vote on the conventions 46th ballot and marshall became wilsons running mate general election in the 1912 general election wilson faced two major opponents oneterm republican incumbent william howard taft and former republican president theodore roosevelt who ran a third party campaign as the bull moose party nominee the fourth candidate was eugene v debs of the socialist party roosevelt had broken with his former party at the 1912 republican national convention after taft narrowly won renomination and the split in the republican party made democrats hopeful that they could win the presidency for the first time since the 1892 presidential electionroosevelt emerged as wilsons main challenger and wilson and roosevelt largely campaigned against each other despite sharing similarly progressive platforms that called for an interventionist central government wilson directed campaign finance chairman henry morgenthau not to accept contributions from corporations and to prioritize smaller donations from the widest possible quarters of the public during the election campaign wilson asserted that it was the task of government to make those adjustments of life which will put every man in a position to claim his normal rights as a living human being with the help of legal scholar louis brandeis he developed his new freedom platform focusing especially on breaking up trusts and lowering tariff rates brandeis and wilson rejected roosevelts proposal to establish a powerful bureaucracy charged with regulating large corporations instead favoring the breakup of large corporations in order to create a level economic playing fieldwilson engaged in a spirited campaign crisscrossing the country to deliver numerous speeches ultimately he took 42 percent of the popular vote and 435 of the 531 electoral votes roosevelt won most of the remaining electoral votes and 274 percent of the popular vote one of the strongest third party performances in us history taft won 232 percent of the popular vote but just 8 electoral votes while debs won 6 percent of the popular vote in the concurrent congressional elections democrats retained control of the house and won a majority in the senate wilsons victory made him the first southerner to win a presidential election since the civil war the first democratic president since grover cleveland left office in 1897 and the first president to hold a phd presidency 19131921 after the election wilson chose william jennings bryan as secretary of state and bryan offered advice on the remaining members of wilsons cabinet william gibbs mcadoo a prominent wilson supporter who married wilsons daughter in 1914 became secretary of the treasury and james clark mcreynolds who had successfully prosecuted several prominent antitrust cases was chosen as attorney general publisher josephus daniels a party loyalist and prominent white supremacist from north carolina was chosen to be secretary of the navy while young new york attorney franklin d roosevelt became assistant secretary of the navy wilsons chief of staff secretary was joseph patrick tumulty who acted as a political buffer and intermediary with the press the most important foreign policy adviser and confidant was colonel edward m house berg writes that in access and influence house outranked everybody in wilsons cabinet new freedom domestic agenda wilson introduced a comprehensive program of domestic legislation at the outset of his administration something no president had ever done before he announced four major domestic priorities the conservation of natural resources banking reform tariff reduction and better access to raw materials for farmers by breaking up western mining trusts wilson introduced these proposals in april 1913 in a speech delivered to a joint session of congress becoming the first president since john adams to address congress in person wilsons first two years in office largely focused on the his domestic agenda with trouble with mexico and the outbreak of world war i in 1914 foreign affairs increasingly dominated his presidency tariff and tax legislation democrats had long seen high tariff rates as equivalent to unfair taxes on consumers and tariff reduction was their first priority he argued that the system of high tariffs cuts us off from our proper part in the commerce of the world violates the just principles of taxation and makes the government a facile instrument in the hands of private interests by late may 1913 house majority leader oscar underwood had passed a bill in the house that cut the average tariff rate by 10 percent and imposed a tax on personal income above 4000 underwoods bill represented the largest downward revision of the tariff since the civil war it aggressively cut rates for raw materials goods deemed to be necessities and products produced domestically by trusts but it retained higher tariff rates for luxury goodsnevertheless the passage of the tariff bill in the senate was a challenge some southern and western democrats wanted the continued protection of their wool and sugar industries and democrats had a narrower majority in the upper house wilson met extensively with democratic senators and appealed directly to the people through the press after weeks of hearings and debate wilson and secretary of state bryan managed to unite senate democrats behind the bill the senate voted 44 to 37 in favor of the bill with only one democrat voting against it and only one republican voting for it wilson signed the revenue act of 1913 called the underwood tariff into law on october 3 1913 the revenue act of 1913 reduced tariffs and replaced the lost revenue with a federal income tax of one percent on incomes above 3000 affecting the richest three percent of the population the policies of the wilson administration had a durable impact on the composition of government revenue which now primarily came from taxation rather than tariffs federal reserve system wilson did not wait to complete the revenue act of 1913 before proceeding to the next item on his agendabanking by the time wilson took office countries like britain and germany had established governmentrun central banks but the united states had not had a central bank since the bank war of the 1830s in the aftermath of the nationwide financial crisis in 1907 there was general agreement to create some sort of central banking system to provide a more elastic currency and to coordinate responses to financial panics wilson sought a middle ground between progressives such as bryan and conservative republicans like nelson aldrich who as chairman of the national monetary commission had put forward a plan for a central bank that would give private financial interests a large degree of control over the monetary system wilson declared that the banking system must be public not private and must be vested in the government itself so that the banks must be the instruments not the masters of businessdemocrats crafted a compromise plan in which private banks would control twelve regional federal reserve banks but a controlling interest in the system was placed in a central board filled with presidential appointees wilson convinced democrats on the left that the new plan met their demands finally the senate voted 5434 to approve the federal reserve act the new system began operations in 1915 and it played a key role in financing the allied and american war efforts in world war i antitrust legislation having passed major legislation lowering the tariff and reforming the banking structure wilson next sought antitrust legislation to enhance the sherman antitrust act of 1890 the sherman antitrust act barred any contract combinationor conspiracy in restraint of trade but had proved ineffective in preventing the rise of large business combinations known as trusts an elite group of businessmen dominated the boards of major banks and railroads and they used their power to prevent competition by new companies with wilsons support congressman henry clayton jr introduced a bill that would ban several anticompetitive practices such as discriminatory pricing tying exclusive dealing and interlocking directoratesas the difficulty of banning all anticompetitive practices via legislation became clear wilson came to back legislation that would create a new agency the federal trade commission ftc to investigate antitrust violations and enforce antitrust laws independently of the justice department with bipartisan support congress passed the federal trade commission act of 1914 which incorporated wilsons ideas regarding the ftc one month after signing the federal trade commission act of 1914 wilson signed the clayton antitrust act of 1914 which built on the sherman act by defining and banning several anticompetitive practices labor and agriculture wilson thought a child labor law would probably be unconstitutional but reversed himself in 1916 with a close election approaching in 1916 after intense campaigns by the national child labor committee nclc and the national consumers league the congress passed the keatingowen act making it illegal to ship goods in interstate commerce if they were made in factories employing children under specified ages southern democrats were opposed but did not filibuster wilson endorsed the bill at the last minute under pressure from party leaders who stressed how popular the idea was especially among the emerging class of women voters he told democratic congressmen they needed to pass this law and also a workmans compensation law to satisfy the national progressive movement and to win the 1916 election against a reunited gop it was the first federal child labor law however the us supreme court struck down the law in hammer v dagenhart 1918 congress then passed a law taxing businesses that used child labor but that was struck down by the supreme court in bailey v drexel furniture 1923 child labor was finally ended in the 1930s he approved the goal of upgrading the harsh working conditions for merchant sailors and signed lafollettes seamens act of 1915wilson called on the labor department to mediate conflicts between labor and management in 1914 wilson dispatched soldiers to help bring an end to the colorado coalfield war one of the deadliest labor disputes in american history in 1916 he pushed congress to enact the eighthour work day for railroad workers which ended a major strike it was the boldest intervention in labor relations that any president had yet attemptedwilson disliked the excessive government involvement in the federal farm loan act which created twelve regional banks empowered to provide lowinterest loans to farmers nevertheless he needed the farm vote to survive the upcoming 1916 election so he signed it territories and immigration wilson embraced the longstanding democratic policy against owning colonies and he worked for the gradual autonomy and ultimate independence of the philippines which had been acquired in 1898 wilson increased selfgovernance on the islands by granting filipinos greater control over the philippine legislature the jones act of 1916 committed the united states to the eventual independence of the philippines independence took place in 1946 in 1916 wilson purchased by treaty the danish west indies renamed as the united states virgin islandsimmigration from europe declined significantly once world war i began and wilson paid little attention to the issue during his presidency however he looked favorably upon the new immigrants from southern and eastern europe and twice vetoed laws passed by congress intended to restrict their entry though the later veto was overridden judicial appointments wilson nominated three men to the united states supreme court all of whom were confirmed by the us senate in 1914 wilson nominated sitting attorney general james clark mcreynolds despite his credentials as an ardent trust buster mcreynolds became a staple of the courts conservative bloc until his retirement in 1941 according to berg wilson considered appointing mcreynolds one of his biggest mistakes in office in 1916 wilson nominated louis brandeis to the court setting off a major debate in the senate over brandeiss progressive ideology and his religion brandeis was the first jewish nominee to the supreme court ultimately wilson was able to convince senate democrats to vote to confirm brandeis who served on the court until 1939 in contrast to mcreynolds brandeis became one of the courts leading progressive voices when a second vacancy arose in 1916 wilson appointed progressive lawyer john hessin clarke clarke was confirmed by the senate and served on the court until retiring in 1922 firstterm foreign policy latin america wilson sought to move away from the foreign policy of his predecessors which he viewed as imperialistic and he rejected tafts dollar diplomacy nonetheless he frequently intervened in latin american affairs saying in 1913 i am going to teach the south american republics to elect good men the 1914 bryanchamorro treaty converted nicaragua into a de facto protectorate and the us stationed soldiers there throughout wilsons presidency the wilson administration sent troops to occupy the dominican republic and intervene in haiti and wilson also authorized military interventions in cuba panama and honduraswilson took office during the mexican revolution which had begun in 1911 after liberals overthrew the military dictatorship of porfirio d√≠az shortly before wilson took office conservatives retook power through a coup led by victoriano huerta wilson rejected the legitimacy of huertas government of butchers and demanded mexico hold democratic elections after huerta arrested us navy personnel who had accidentally landed in a restricted zone near the northern port town of tampico wilson dispatched the navy to occupy the mexican city of veracruz a strong backlash against the american intervention among mexicans of all political affiliations convinced wilson to abandon his plans to expand the us military intervention but the intervention nonetheless helped convince huerta to flee from the country a group led by venustiano carranza established control over a significant proportion of mexico and wilson recognized carranzas government in october 1915carranza continued to face various opponents within mexico including pancho villa whom wilson had earlier described as a sort of robin hood in early 1916 pancho villa raided the village of columbus new mexico killing or wounding dozens of americans and causing an enormous nationwide american demand for his punishment wilson ordered general john j pershing and 4000 troops across the border to capture villa by april pershings forces had broken up and dispersed villas bands but villa remained on the loose and pershing continued his pursuit deep into mexico carranza then pivoted against the americans and accused them of a punitive invasion leading to several incidents that nearly led to war tensions subsided after mexico agreed to release several american prisoners and bilateral negotiations began under the auspices of the mexicanamerican joint high commission eager to withdraw from mexico due to tensions in europe wilson ordered pershing to withdraw and the last american soldiers left in february 1917 neutrality in world war i world war i broke out in july 1914 pitting the central powers germany austriahungary the ottoman empire and later bulgaria against the allied powers britain france russia serbia and several other countries the war fell into a long stalemate with very high casualties on the western front in france both sides rejected offers by wilson and house to mediate an end the conflict from 1914 until early 1917 wilsons primary foreign policy objectives were to keep the united states out of the war in europe and to broker a peace agreement he insisted that all us government actions be neutral stating that americans must be impartial in thought as well as in action must put a curb upon our sentiments as well as upon every transaction that might be construed as a preference of one party to the struggle before another as a neutral power the us insisted on its right to trade with both sides however the powerful british royal navy imposed a blockade of germany to appease washington london agreed to continue purchasing certain major american commodities such as cotton at prewar prices and in the event an american merchant vessel was caught with contraband the royal navy was under orders to buy the entire cargo and release the vessel wilson passively accepted this situationin response to the british blockade germany launched a submarine campaign against merchant vessels in the seas surrounding the british isles in early 1915 the germans sank three american ships wilson took the view based on some reasonable evidence that these incidents were accidental and a settlement of claims could be postponed until the end of the war in may 1915 a german submarine torpedoed the british ocean liner rms lusitania killing 1198 passengers including 128 american citizens wilson publicly responded by saying there is such a thing as a man being too proud to fight there is such a thing as a nation being so right that it does not need to convince others by force that it is right wilson demanded that the german government take immediate steps to prevent the recurrence of incidents like the sinking of the lusitania in response bryan who believed that wilson had placed the defense of american trade rights above neutrality resigned from the cabinet in march 1916 the ss sussex an unarmed ferry under the french flag was torpedoed in the english channel and four americans were counted among the dead wilson extracted from germany a pledge to constrain submarine warfare to the rules of cruiser warfare which represented a major diplomatic concessioninterventionists led by theodore roosevelt wanted war with germany and attacked wilsons refusal to build up the army in anticipation of war after the sinking of the lusitania and the resignation of bryan wilson publicly committed himself to what became known as the preparedness movement and began to build up the army and the navy in june 1916 congress passed the national defense act of 1916 which established the reserve officers training corps and expanded the national guard later in the year congress passed the naval act of 1916 which provided for a major expansion of the navy remarriage the health of wilsons wife ellen declined after he entered office and doctors diagnosed her with brights disease in july 1914 she died on august 6 1914 wilson was deeply affected by the loss falling into depression on march 18 1915 wilson met edith bolling galt at a white house tea galt was a widow and jeweler who was also from the south after several meetings wilson fell in love with her and he proposed marriage to her in may 1915 galt initially rebuffed him but wilson was undeterred and continued the courtship edith gradually warmed to the relationship and they became engaged in september 1915 they were married on december 18 1915 wilson joined john tyler and grover cleveland as the only presidents to marry while in office presidential election of 1916 wilson was renominated at the 1916 democratic national convention without opposition in an effort to win progressive voters wilson called for legislation providing for an eighthour day and sixday workweek health and safety measures the prohibition of child labor and safeguards for female workers he also favored a minimum wage for all work performed by and for the federal government the democrats also campaigned on the slogan he kept us out of war and warned that a republican victory would mean war with germany hoping to reunify the progressive and conservative wings of the party the 1916 republican national convention nominated supreme court justice charles evans hughes for president as a justice he had been totally out of politics in 1912 though republicans attacked wilsons foreign policy on various grounds domestic affairs generally dominated the campaign republicans campaigned against wilsons new freedom policies especially tariff reduction the new income taxes and the adamson act which they derided as class legislation the election was close and the outcome was in doubt with hughes ahead in the east and wilson in the south and west the decision came down to california on november 10 california certified that wilson had won the state by 3806 votes giving him a majority of the electoral vote nationally wilson won 277 electoral votes and 492 percent of the popular vote while hughes won 254 electoral votes and 461 percent of the popular vote wilson was able to win by picking up many votes that had gone to roosevelt or debs in 1912 he swept the solid south and won all but a handful of western states while hughes won most of the northeastern and midwestern states wilsons reelection made him the first democrat since andrew jackson in 1832 to win two consecutive terms the democrats kept control of congress entering the war in january 1917 the germans initiated a new policy of unrestricted submarine warfare against ships in the seas around the british isles german leaders knew that the policy would likely provoke us entrance into the war but they hoped to defeat the allied powers before the us could fully mobilize in late february the us public learned of the zimmermann telegram a secret diplomatic communication in which germany sought to convince mexico to join it in a war against the united states after a series of attacks on american ships wilson held a cabinet meeting on march 20 all cabinet members agreed that the time had come for the united states to enter the war the cabinet members believed that germany was engaged in a commercial war against the united states and that the united states had to respond with a formal declaration of waron april 2 1917 wilson asked congress for a declaration of war against germany arguing that germany was engaged in nothing less than war against the government and people of the united states he requested a military draft to raise the army increased taxes to pay for military expenses loans to allied governments and increased industrial and agricultural production he stated we have no selfish ends to serve we desire no conquest no dominion no material compensation for the sacrifices we shall freely make we are but one of the champions of the rights of mankind we shall be satisfied when those rights have been made as secure as the faith and freedom of the nations can make them the declaration of war by the united states against germany passed congress with strong bipartisan majorities on april 6 1917 the united states later declared war against austriahungary in december 1917with the us entrance into the war wilson and secretary of war newton d baker launched an expansion of the army with the goal of creating a 300000member regular army a 440000member national guard and a 500000member conscripted force known as the national army despite some resistance to conscription and to the commitment of american soldiers abroad large majorities of both houses of congress voted to impose conscription with the selective service act of 1917 seeking to avoid the draft riots of the civil war the bill established local draft boards that were charged with determining who should be drafted by the end of the war nearly 3 million men had been drafted the navy also saw tremendous expansion and allied shipping losses dropped substantially due to us contributions and a new emphasis on the convoy system the fourteen points wilson sought the establishment of an organized common peace that would help prevent future conflicts in this goal he was opposed not just by the central powers but also the other allied powers who to various degrees sought to win concessions and to impose a punitive peace agreement on the central powers on january 8 1918 wilson delivered a speech known as the fourteen points wherein he articulated his administrations long term war objectives wilson called for the establishment of an association of nations to guarantee the independence and territorial integrity of all nationsa league of nations other points included the evacuation of occupied territory the establishment of an independent poland and selfdetermination for the peoples of austriahungary and the ottoman empire course of the war under the command of general pershing the american expeditionary forces first arrived in france in mid1917 wilson and pershing rejected the british and french proposal that american soldiers integrate into existing allied units giving the united states more freedom of action but requiring for the creation of new organizations and supply chains russia exited the war after signing the treaty of brestlitovsk in march 1918 allowing germany to shift soldiers from the eastern front of the war hoping to break allied lines before american soldiers could arrive in full force the germans launched the spring offensive on the western front both sides suffered hundreds of thousands of casualties as the germans forced back the british and french but germany was unable to capture the french capital of paris there were only 175000 american soldiers in europe at the end of 1917 but by mid1918 10000 americans were arriving in europe per day with american forces having joined in the fight the allies defeated germany in the battle of belleau wood and the battle of ch√¢teauthierry beginning in august the allies launched the hundred days offensive pushing back the exhausted german army meanwhile french and british leaders convinced wilson to send a few thousand american soldiers to join the allied intervention in russia which was in the midst of a civil war between the communist bolsheviks and the white movementby the end of september 1918 the german leadership no longer believed it could win the war and kaiser wilhelm ii appointed a new government led by prince maximilian of baden baden immediately sought an armistice with wilson with the fourteen points to serve as the basis of the german surrender house procured agreement to the armistice from france and britain but only after threatening to conclude a unilateral armistice without them germany and the allied powers brought an end to the fighting with the signing of the armistice of 11 november 1918 austriahungary had signed the armistice of villa giusti eight days earlier while the ottoman empire had signed the armistice of mudros in october by the end of the war 116000 american servicemen had died and another 200000 had been wounded home front with the american entrance into world war i in april 1917 wilson became a wartime president the war industries board headed by bernard baruch was established to set us war manufacturing policies and goals future president herbert hoover led the food administration the federal fuel administration run by harry augustus garfield introduced daylight saving time and rationed fuel supplies william mcadoo was in charge of war bond efforts vance c mccormick headed the war trade board these men known collectively as the war cabinet met weekly with wilson because he was heavily focused on foreign policy during world war i wilson delegated a large degree of authority over the home front to his subordinates in the midst of the war the federal budget soared from 1 billion in fiscal year 1916 to 19 billion in fiscal year 1919 in addition to spending on its own military buildup wall street in 19141916 and the treasury in 19171918 provided large loans to the allied countries thus financing the war effort of britain and franceseeking to avoid the high levels of inflation that had accompanied the heavy borrowing of the american civil war the wilson administration raised taxes during the war the war revenue act of 1917 and the revenue act of 1918 raised the top tax rate to 77 percent greatly increased the number of americans paying the income tax and levied an excess profits tax on businesses and individuals despite these tax acts the united states was forced to borrow heavily to finance the war effort treasury secretary mcadoo authorized the issuing of lowinterest war bonds and to attract investors made interest on the bonds taxfree the bonds proved so popular among investors that many borrowed money in order to buy more bonds the purchase of bonds along with other wartime pressures resulted in rising inflation though this inflation was partly matched by rising wages and profitsto shape public opinion wilson in 1917 established the first modern propaganda office the committee on public information cpi headed by george creelwilson called on voters in the 1918 offyear elections to elect democrats as an endorsement of his policies however the republicans won over alienated germanamericans and took control wilson refused to coordinate or compromise with the new leaders of house and senatesenator henry cabot lodge became his nemesisin november 1919 wilsons attorney general a mitchell palmer began to target anarchists industrial workers of the world members and other antiwar groups in what became known as the palmer raids thousands were arrested for incitement to violence espionage or sedition wilson by that point was incapacitated and was not told what was happening aftermath of world war i paris peace conference after the signing of the armistice wilson traveled to europe to lead the american delegation to the paris peace conference thereby becoming the first incumbent president to travel to europe although republicans now controlled congress wilson shut them out senate republicans and even some senate democrats complained about their lack of representation in the delegation it consisted of wilson colonel house secretary of state robert lansing general tasker h bliss and diplomat henry white was the only republican and he was not an active partisan save for a twoweek return to the united states wilson remained in europe for six months where he focused on reaching a peace treaty to formally end the war wilson british prime minister david lloyd george french prime minister georges clemenceau and italian prime minister vittorio emanuele orlando made up the big four the allied leaders with the most influence at the paris peace conference wilson had an illness during the conference and some experts believe the spanish flu was the causeunlike other allied leaders wilson did not seek territorial gains or material concessions from the central powers his chief goal was the establishment of the league of nations which he saw as the keystone of the whole programme wilson himself presided over the committee that drafted the covenant of the league of nations the covenant bound members to respect freedom of religion treat racial minorities fairly and peacefully settle disputes through organizations like the permanent court of international justice article x of the league covenant required all nations to defend league members against external aggression japan proposed that the conference endorse a racial equality clause wilson was indifferent to the issue but acceded to strong opposition from australia and britain the covenant of the league of nations was incorporated into the conferences treaty of versailles which ended the war with germany and into other peace treaties aside from the establishment the league of nations and solidifying a lasting world peace wilsons other main goal at the paris peace conference was that selfdetermination be the primary basis used for drawing new international borders however in pursuit of his league of nations wilson conceded several points to the other powers present at the conference germany was required to permanently cede territory pay war reparations relinquish all of her overseas colonies and dependencies and submit to military occupation in the rhineland additionally a clause in the treaty specifically named germany as responsible for the war wilson agreed to allowing the allied european powers and japan to essentially expand their empires by establishing de facto colonies in the middle east africa and asia out the former german and ottoman empires these territorial awards to the victorious countries were thinly disguised as league of nations mandates the japanese acquisition of german interests in the shandong peninsula of china proved especially unpopular as it undercut wilsons promise of selfgovernment wilsons hopes for achieving selfdetermination saw some success when the conference recognized multiple new and independent states created in eastern europe including albania czechoslovakia poland and yugoslaviathe conference finished negotiations in may 1919 at which point the new leaders of republican germany viewed the treaty for the first time some german leaders favored repudiating the peace due to the harshness of the terms though ultimately germany signed the treaty on june 28 1919 wilson was unable to convince the other allied powers france in particular to temper the harshness of the settlement being leveled at the defeated central powers especially germany for his efforts towards creating a lasting world peace wilson was awarded the 1919 nobel peace prize ratification debate and defeat ratification of the treaty of versailles required the support of twothirds of the senate a difficult proposition given that republicans held a narrow majority in the senate after the 1918 us elections republicans were outraged by wilsons failure to discuss the war or its aftermath with them and an intensely partisan battle developed in the senate republican senator henry cabot lodge supported a version of the treaty that required wilson to compromise wilson refused some republicans including former president taft and former secretary of state elihu root favored ratification of the treaty with some modifications and their public support gave wilson some chance of winning the treatys ratificationthe debate over the treaty centered around a debate over the american role in the world community in the postwar era and senators fell into three main groups the first group consisting of most democrats favored the treaty fourteen senators mostly republicans were known as the irreconcilables as they completely opposed us entrance into the league of nations some of these irreconcilables opposed the treaty for its failure to emphasize decolonization and disarmament while others feared surrendering american freedom of action to an international organization the remaining group of senators known as reservationists accepted the idea of the league but sought varying degrees of change to ensure the protection of american sovereignty and the right of congress to decide on going to wararticle x of the league covenant which sought to create a system of collective security by requiring league members to protect one another against external aggression seemed to force the us to join in any war the league decided upon wilson consistently refused to compromise partly due to concerns about having to reopen negotiations with the other treaty signatories when lodge was on the verge of building a twothirds majority to ratify the treaty with ten reservations wilson forced his supporters to vote nay on march 19 1920 thereby closing the issue cooper says that nearly every league advocate went along with lodge but their efforts failed solely because wilson admittedly rejected all reservations proposed in the senate thomas a bailey calls wilsons action the supreme act of infanticide he adds the treaty was slain in the house of its friends rather than in the house of its enemies in the final analysis it was not the twothirds rule or the irreconcilables or lodge or the strong and mild reservationists but wilson and his docile following who delivered the fatal stab health collapses to bolster public support for ratification wilson barnstormed the western states but he returned to the white house in late september due to health problems on october 2 1919 wilson suffered a serious stroke leaving him paralyzed on his left side and with only partial vision in the right eye he was confined to bed for weeks and sequestered from everyone except his wife and his physician dr cary grayson dr bert e park a neurosurgeon who examined wilsons medical records after his death writes that wilsons illness affected his personality in various ways making him prone to disorders of emotion impaired impulse control and defective judgment anxious to help the president recover tumulty grayson and the first lady determined what documents the president read and who was allowed to communicate with him for her influence in the administration some have described edith wilson as the first female president of the united states link states that by november 1919 wilsons recovery was only partial at best his mind remained relatively clear but he was physically enfeebled and the disease had wrecked his emotional constitution and aggravated all his more unfortunate personal traitsthroughout late 1919 wilsons inner circle concealed the severity of his health issues by february 1920 the presidents true condition was publicly known many expressed qualms about wilsons fitness for the presidency at a time when the league fight was reaching a climax and domestic issues such as strikes unemployment inflation and the threat of communism were ablaze in midmarch 1920 lodge and his republicans formed a coalition with the protreaty democrats to pass a treaty with reservations but wilson rejected this compromise and enough democrats followed his lead to defeat ratification no one close to wilson was willing to certify as required by the constitution his inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office though some members of congress encouraged vice president marshall to assert his claim to the presidency marshall never attempted to replace wilson wilsons lengthy period of incapacity while serving as president was nearly unprecedented of the previous presidents only james garfield had been in a similar situation but garfield retained greater control of his mental faculties and faced relatively few pressing issues demobilization when the war ended the wilson administration dismantled the wartime boards and regulatory agencies demobilization was chaotic and at times violent four million soldiers were sent home with little money and few benefits in 1919 strikes in major industries broke out disrupting the economy the country experienced further turbulence as a series of race riots broke out in the summer of 1919 in 1920 the economy plunged into a severe economic depression unemployment rose to 12 percent and the price of agricultural products sharply declined red scare and palmer raids following the bolshevik revolution in russia and similar attempts in germany and hungary many americans feared the possibility of terrorism in the united states such concerns were inflamed by the bombings in april 1919 when anarchists mailed 38 bombs to prominent americans one person was killed but most packages were intercepted nine more mail bombs were sent in june injuring several people fresh fears combined with a patriotic national mood sparking the first red scare in 1919 attorney general palmer from november 1919 to january 1920 launched the palmer raids to suppress radical organizations over 10000 people were arrested and 556 aliens were deported including emma goldman palmers activities met resistance from the courts and some senior administration officials no one told wilson what palmer was doing later in 1920 the wall street bombing on september 16 killed 40 and injured hundreds in the deadliest terrorist attack on american soil up to that point anarchists took credit and promised more violence to come they escaped capture prohibition and womens suffrage prohibition developed as an unstoppable reform during the war but the wilson administration played only a minor role the eighteenth amendment passed congress and was ratified by the states in 1919 in october 1919 wilson vetoed the volstead act legislation designed to enforce prohibition but his veto was overridden by congresswilson personally opposed womens suffrage in 1911 because he believed women lacked the public experience needed to be good voters the actual evidence of how women voters behaved in the western states changed his mind and he came to feel they could indeed be good voters he did not speak publicly on the issue except to echo the democratic party position that suffrage was a state matter primarily because of strong opposition in the white south to black voting rightsin a 1918 speech before congress wilson for the first time backed a national right to vote we have made partners of the women in this warshall we admit them only to a partnership of suffering and sacrifice and toil and not to a partnership of privilege and right the house passed a constitutional amendment providing for womens suffrage nationwide but this stalled in the senate wilson continually pressured the senate to vote for the amendment telling senators that its ratification was vital to winning the war the senate finally approved it in june 1919 and the requisite number of states ratified the nineteenth amendment in august 1920 1920 election despite his medical incapacity wilson wanted to run for a third term while the 1920 democratic national convention strongly endorsed wilsons policies democratic leaders refused nominating instead a ticket consisting of governor james m cox and assistant secretary of the navy franklin d roosevelt the republicans centered their campaign around opposition to wilsons policies with senator warren g harding promising a return to normalcy wilson largely stayed out of the campaign although he endorsed cox and continued to advocate for us membership in the league of nations harding won a landslide winning over 60 of the popular vote and every state outside of the south wilson met with harding for tea on his last day in office march 3 1921 due to his health wilson was unable to attend the inaugurationon december 10 1920 wilson was awarded the 1919 nobel peace prize for his role as founder of the league of nations wilson became the second sitting united states president after theodore roosevelt to become a nobel peace laureate final years and death 19211924 after the end of his second term in 1921 wilson and his wife moved from the white house to a town house in the kalorama section of washington dc he continued to follow politics as president harding and the republican congress repudiated membership in the league of nations cut taxes and raised tariffs in 1921 wilson opened a law practice with former secretary of state bainbridge colby wilson showed up the first day but never returned and the practice was closed by the end of 1922 wilson tried writing and he produced a few short essays after enormous effort they marked a sad finish to a formerly great literary career he declined to write memoirs but frequently met with ray stannard baker who wrote a threevolume biography of wilson that was published in 1922 in august 1923 wilson attended the funeral of his successor warren harding on november 10 1923 wilson made his last national address delivering a short armistice day radio speech from the library of his home wilsons health did not markedly improve after leaving office declining rapidly in january 1924 woodrow wilson died on february 3 1924 at the age of 67 he was interred in washington national cathedral being the only president whose final resting place lies within the nations capital race relations wilson was born and raised in the south by parents who were committed supporters of both slavery and the confederacy academically wilson was an apologist for slavery and the redeemers and one of the foremost promoters of the lost cause mythology wilson was the first southerner elected president since zachary taylor in 1848 and the only former subject of the confederacy wilsons election was celebrated by southern segregationists at princeton wilson actively dissuaded the admission of africanamericans as students several historians have spotlighted consistent examples in the public record of wilsons overtly racist policies and the inclusion of segregationists in his cabinet other sources say wilson defended segregation as a rational scientific policy in private and describe him as a man who loved to tell racist darky jokes about black americansduring wilsons presidency d w griffiths proku klux klan film the birth of a nation 1915 was the first motion picture to be screened in the white house though he was not initially critical of the movie wilson distanced himself from it as public backlash mounted and eventually released a statement condemning the films message while denying he had been aware of it prior to the screening segregating the federal bureaucracy by the 1910s africanamericans had become effectively shut out of elected office obtaining an executive appointment to a position within the federal bureaucracy was usually the only option for africanamerican statesmen according to berg wilson continued to appoint africanamericans to positions that had traditionally been filled by black people overcoming opposition from many southern senators oswald garrison villard who later became an opponent of his initially thought that wilson was not a bigot and supported progress for black people and he was frustrated by southern opposition in the senate to which wilson capitulated in a conversation with wilson journalist john palmer gavit came to the realization that opposition to those views would certainly precipitate a conflict which would put a complete stop to any legislative program since the end of reconstruction both parties recognized certain appointments as unofficially reserved for qualified africanamericans wilson appointed a total of nine africanamericans to prominent positions in the federal bureaucracy eight of whom were republican carryovers for comparison william howard taft was met with disdain and outrage from republicans of both races for appointing thirtyone black officeholders a record low for a republican president upon taking office wilson fired all but two of the seventeen black supervisors in the federal bureaucracy appointed by taftsince 1863 the us mission to haiti and santo domingo was almost always led by an africanamerican diplomat regardless of what party the sitting president belonged to wilson ended this halfcenturyold tradition but continued to appoint black diplomats like george washington buckner as well as joseph l johnson to head the mission to liberia since the end of reconstruction the federal bureaucracy had been possibly the only career path where africanamericans could experience some measure of equality and was the life blood and foundation of the black middleclass wilsons administration escalated the discriminatory hiring policies and segregation of government offices that had begun under theodore roosevelt and continued under taft in wilsons first month in office postmaster general albert s burleson urged the president to establish segregated government offices wilson did not adopt burlesons proposal but allowed cabinet secretaries discretion to segregate their respective departments by the end of 1913 many departments including the navy treasury and post office had segregated work spaces restrooms and cafeterias many agencies used segregation as a pretext to adopt a whitesonly employment policy claiming they lacked facilities for black workers in these instances africanamericans employed prior to the wilson administration were either offered early retirement transferred or simply firedracial discrimination in federal hiring increased further when after 1914 the united states civil service commission instituted a new policy requiring job applicants to submit a personal photo with their application as a federal enclave washington dc had long offered africanamericans greater opportunities for employment and less glaring discrimination in 1919 black veterans returning home to dc were shocked to discover jim crow laws had set in many could not go back to the jobs they held prior to the war or even enter the same building they used to work in due to the color of their skin booker t washington described the situation i had never seen the colored people so discouraged and bitter as they are at the present time africanamericans in the armed forces while segregation had been present in the army prior to wilson its severity increased significantly under his election during wilsons first term the army and navy refused to commission new black officers black officers already serving experienced increased discrimination and were often forced out or discharged on dubious grounds following the entry of the us into world war i the war department drafted hundreds of thousands of black people into the army and draftees were paid equally regardless of race commissioning of africanamericans officers resumed but units remained segregated and most allblack units were led by white officersunlike the army the us navy was never formally segregated following wilsons appointment of josephus daniels as secretary of the navy a system of jim crow was swiftly implemented with ships training facilities restrooms and cafeterias all becoming segregated while daniels significantly expanded opportunities for advancement and training available to white sailors by the time the us entered world war i africanamerican sailors had been relegated almost entirely to mess and custodial duties often assigned to act as servants for white officers response to racial violence in response to the demand for industrial labor the great migration of african americans out of the south surged in 1917 and 1918 this migration sparked race riots including the east st louis riots of 1917 in response to these riots but only after much public outcry wilson asked attorney general thomas watt gregory if the federal government could intervene to check these disgraceful outrages on the advice of gregory wilson did not take direct action against the riots in 1918 wilson spoke out against lynching in the united states stating i say plainly that every american who takes part in the action of mob or gives it any sort of continence is no true son of this great democracy but its betrayer and discredits her by that single disloyalty to her standards of law and of rights in 1919 another series of race riots occurred in chicago omaha and two dozen other major cities in the north the federal government did not become involved just as it had not become involved previously legacy historical reputation wilson is generally ranked by historians and political scientists as an above average president in the view of some historians wilson more than any of his predecessors took steps towards the creation of a strong federal government that would protect ordinary citizens against the overwhelming power of large corporations he is generally regarded as a key figure in the establishment of modern american liberalism and a strong influence on future presidents such as franklin d roosevelt and lyndon b johnson cooper argues that in terms of impact and ambition only the new deal and the great society rival the domestic accomplishments of wilsons presidency many of wilsons accomplishments including the federal reserve the federal trade commission the graduated income tax and labor laws continued to influence the united states long after wilsons deathmany conservatives have attacked wilson for his role in expanding the federal government in 2018 conservative columnist george will wrote in the washington post that theodore roosevelt and wilson were the progenitors of todays imperial presidency wilsons idealistic foreign policy which came to be known as wilsonianism also cast a long shadow over american foreign policy and wilsons league of nations influenced the development of the united nations saladin ambar writes that wilson was the first statesman of world stature to speak out not only against european imperialism but against the newer form of economic domination sometimes described as informal imperialismnotwithstanding his accomplishments in office wilson has received criticism for his record on race relations and civil liberties for his interventions in latin america and for his failure to win ratification of the treaty of versailles despite his southern roots and record at princeton wilson became the first democrat to receive widespread support from the africanamerican community in a presidential election wilsons africanamerican supporters many of whom had crossed party lines to vote for him in 1912 found themselves bitterly disappointed by the wilson presidency his decision to allow the imposition of jim crow within the federal bureaucracy in particularross kennedy writes that wilsons support of segregation complied with predominant public opinion a scott berg argues wilson accepted segregation as part of a policy to promote racial progress by shocking the social system as little as possible the ultimate result of this policy was unprecedented levels of segregation within the federal bureaucracy and far fewer opportunities for employment and promotion being open to africanamericans than before historian kendrick clements argues wilson had none of the crude vicious racism of james k vardaman or benjamin r tillman but he was insensitive to africanamerican feelings and aspirations a 2021 study in the quarterly journal of economics found that wilsons segregation of the civil service increased the blackwhite earnings gap by 3469 percentage points as existing black civil servants were driven to lowerpaid positions black civil servants who were exposed to wilsons segregationist policies experienced a relative decline in home ownership rates with suggestive evidence of lasting adverse effects for the descendants of those black civil servants in the wake of the charleston church shooting some individuals demanded the removal of wilsons name from institutions affiliated with princeton due to his stance on race memorials the woodrow wilson

swedish ancestry brians two younger brothers dennis and carl were born in 1944 and 1946 respectively shortly after dennis birth the family moved from inglewood to 3701 west 119th street in nearby hawthorne california like his brothers brian suffered abuse from his father that was mostly psychological and sometimes physical he characterized his father as violent and cruel however many of the stories which later circulated about his fathers treatment were dirty lies according to wilson and that even the things that are true had been misreportedfrom an early age wilson demonstrated an extraordinary skill for learning by ear speaking of his unusual musical abilities prior to his first birthday his father said that as a baby he could repeat the melody from when the caissons go rolling along after only a few verses had been sung by the father the wilsons father encouraged his children in the music field in numerous ways as a child wilson was given six weeks of lessons on a toy accordion and at seven and eight sang solos in church with a choir behind him there his choir director discovered that wilson had perfect pitch after the wilson family purchased a piano for their home brian abandoned his accordion and devoted hours to learning his favorite songs on piano later he learned to write manuscript music from a friend of his fathers wilson sang with various students at school functions and with his family and friends at home teaching his two brothers harmony parts that all three would then practice he also played piano obsessively after school deconstructing the harmonies of the four freshmen by listening to short segments of their songs on a phonograph then working to recreate the blended sounds note by note on the keyboard moreover he owned an educational record called the instruments of the orchestra and frequently listened to his favorite radio station at the time kfwb he was introduced to rb by carl and taught to play boogie woogie piano by their uncle charlie according to brian he and carl often stayed up all night listening to johnny otis kfox radio show to discuss its rb songs and add them to our musical vocabulary carl said that by the time brian was ten he could play great boogiewoogie pianoone of brians first songwriting exercises penned on a sheet of paper when he was nine was a rewriting of the lyrics to stephen fosters oh susannah in his 1991 memoir he recalls writing his first song for a 4th grade school project concerning paul bunyan in a 2005 interview he said that he began composing original music in 1955 when he was 12carl said there were many years of brians life where he did nothing but play the piano months at a time days on end four freshmen records just all music dennis remembered brian was the freak he used to stay in his room all day listening to records rather than play baseball their mother recalled that brian constantly listened to the radio in his room during his junior high school years murry once said to me do you think we should worry about him i said no hes just loving the music high school and college in high school wilson was quarterback on his local football team at hawthorne high he also played baseball and was a crosscountry runner in his senior year before his success in music wilsons only paid employment was a parttime job sweeping at a jewelry store for four months when he was 15 on weekends he was also a cleaner for his fathers machining company able around this time wilson auditioned to be the singer of the record to mark the launch of the original sound record company chapel of love unrelated to the 1964 song but he was rejected for being too young for his 16th birthday he received a portable twotrack wollensak tape recorder allowing him to experiment with recording songs group vocals and rudimentary production techniques biographer peter ames carlin writes that the tapes suggest that brian liked nothing more than to gather his friends around the piano most often hed harmonize with friends from his senior class written for his senior problems course in october 1959 wilson submitted an essay my philosophy in which he stated that his ambitions were to make a name for myself in music one of wilsons earliest public performances was at a fall arts program at his high school he enlisted his cousin and frequent singing partner mike love and to entice carl into the group named the newly formed membership carl and the passions the performance featured tunes by dion and the belmonts and the four freshmen its a blue world the latter of which proved difficult for the ensemble the event was notable for the impression which it made on another musician and classmate of wilsons in the audience al jardinefred morgan wilsons high school music teacher remembered that wilson at 17 had demonstrated an aboveaverage understanding of bach and beethoven nonetheless he gave wilson a final grade of c for his piano and harmony course due to incomplete assignments for his final project instead of composing a 120measure piano sonata wilson submitted a 32measure piece morgan gave the work an f reflecting on his last year of high school brian said that he was very happy i wouldnt say i was popular in school but i was associated with popular peoplewilson enrolled as a psychology major at el camino junior college in los angeles in september 1960 while simultaneously continuing his musical studies at the community college as well he was disappointed to find that his music teachers strongly disapproved of pop music and he quit college after a year and half by wilsons account he wrote his first alloriginal melody loosely based on a dion and the belmonts version of when you wish upon a star in 1961 the song was eventually known as surfer girl however wilsons closest high school friends disputed this recalling that wilson had written numerous songs prior to surfer girl formation of the beach boys wilson brothers carl and dennis cousin mike love and their friend al jardine first appeared as a music group in the autumn of 1961 initially under the name the pendletones after being prodded by dennis to write a song about the local watersports craze wilson and mike love together created what became the first single for the band surfin around this time the group rented an amplifier a microphone and a standup bass for jardine to play after the boys rehearsed for several weeks in the wilsons music room his parents returned home from a brief trip to mexico eventually impressed murry wilson proclaimed himself the groups manager and the band embarked on serious rehearsals for a proper studio sessionrecorded by hite and dorinda morgan and released on the small candix records label surfin became a top local hit in los angeles and reached number 75 on the national billboard sales charts dennis later described the first time that his older brother heard their song on the radio as the three wilson brothers and david marks drove in wilsons 1957 ford in the rain nothing will ever top the expression on brians face ever that was the alltime moment however the pendletones were no more as candix records had changed their name to the beach boys wilson and his bandmates following a set by ike tina turner performed their first major live show at the ritchie valens memorial dance on new years eve 1961 three days previously wilsons father had bought him an electric bass and amplifier wilson had learned to play the instrument in that short period of time with jardine moving to rhythm guitar when candix records ran into money problems and sold the beach boys master recordings to another label wilsons father terminated the contract as surfin faded from the charts wilson who had forged a songwriting partnership with local musician gary usher created several new songs including a car song 409 that usher helped them write wilson and the beach boys cut new tracks at western recorders in hollywood including surfin safari and 409 these songs convinced capitol records to release the demos as a single they became a doublesided national hit 19621966 peak years early productions and freelance work as a member of the beach boys wilson was signed by capitol records nick venet to a sevenyear contract in 1962 recording sessions for the bands first album surfin safari took place in capitols basement studios in the famous tower building in august but early on wilson lobbied for a different place to cut beach boys tracks the large rooms were built to record the big orchestras and ensembles of the 1950s not small rock groups at wilsons insistence capitol agreed to let the beach boys pay for their own outside recording sessions to which capitol would own all the rights additionally during the taping of their first lp wilson fought for and won the right to helm the production though this fact was not acknowledged with a production credit in the album liner noteswilson remarked ive always felt i was a behindthescenes man rather than an entertainer he had been a massive fan of phil spector who had risen to fame with the teddy bears and aspired to model his burgeoning career after the record producer with gary usher wilson wrote numerous songs patterned after the teddy bears and they wrote and produced some records for local talent albeit with no commercial success brian gradually dissolved his partnership with usher due to interference from murry brians first record that he produced outside of the beach boys albeit uncredited was rachel and the revolvers the revolution written with usher and issued by dot records in septemberby mid1962 brian was writing songs with dj roger christian whom he had met through either murry or usher and guitarist bob norberg who became wilsons roommate david marks said he was obsessed with it brian was writing song with people off the street in front of his house disc jockeys anyone he had so much stuff flowing through him at once he could hardly handle it in october safari records a label created by murry released the single the surfer moon by bob sheri it was the first record that bore the label produced by brian wilson the only other record the label issued was bob sheris humpty dumpty both songs were written by wilson from january to march 1963 wilson produced the beach boys second album surfin usa to focus his efforts on writing and recording he limited his public appearances with the group to television gigs and local shows otherwise david marks acted as wilsons substitute on vocals in march capitol released the beach boys first topten single surfin usa which began their long run of highly successful recording efforts at western the surfin usa album was also a big hit in the us reaching number two on the national sales charts by july the beach boys had become a toprank recording and touring bandagainst venets wishes wilson worked with noncapitol acts shortly after meeting liberty records jan and dean likely in august 1962 wilson offered them a new song he had written surf city which the duo soon recorded on july 20 1963 surf city which wilson cowrote with jan berry was his first composition to reach the top of the us charts the resulting success pleased wilson but angered both murry and capitol records murry went so far as to order his oldest son to sever any future collaborations with jan and dean although they continued to appear on each others records wilsons hits with jan and dean effectively revitalized the music duos thenfaltering career around the same time wilson began producing a girl group the honeys consisting of sisters marilyn and diane rovell and their cousin ginger blake who were local high school students he had met at a beach boys concert during the previous august wilson pitched the honeys to capitol envisioning them as a female counterpart to the beach boys the company released several honeys recordings as singles although they sold poorly in the meantime wilson became closely acquainted with the rovell family and made their home his primary residence for most of 1963 and 1964wilson was for the first time officially credited as the beach boys producer on the album surfer girl recorded in june and july 1963 and released that september this lp reached number seven on the national charts with similarly successful singles he also produced a set of largely caroriented tunes for the beach boys fourth album little deuce coupe which was released in october 1963 only three weeks after the surfer girl lp still resistant to touring wilson was replaced onstage for many of the bands live performances in mid1963 by al jardine who had briefly quit the band to focus on school wilson was forced to rejoin the touring lineup upon marks departure in late 1963towards the end of 1963 wilson formed a record production company brian wilson productions with an office on sunset boulevard and a music publishing company ocean music for songs he wrote for other artists excepting his work with the beach boys for the whole of 1963 wilson had written arranged produced or performed on at least 42 songs with the honeys jan and dean the survivors sharon marie the timers the castells i do bob norberg vickie kocher gary usher christian paul petersen she rides with me and larry denton endless sleep international success and first nervous breakdown throughout 1964 wilson engaged in worldwide concert tours with the beach boys while continuing to write and produce for the group whose studio output for this year included the albums shut down volume 2 march all summer long june and the beach boys christmas album november following a particularly stressful australasian tour in early 1964 it was agreed by the group to dismiss murry from his managerial duties murry still had a subsequent influence over the bands activities and kept a direct correspondence with brian giving him thoughts about the groups decisions wilson also periodically sought music opinions from his fatherin february beatlemania swept the us a development that deeply disturbed wilson in a 1966 interview he commented the beatles invasion shook me up a lot they eclipsed a lot of what wed worked for the beach boys supremacy as the number one vocal group in america was being challenged so we stepped on the gas a little bit author james perone identifies the beach boys may single i get around their first us number one hit as representing both a successful response by wilson to the british invasion and the beginning of an unofficial rivalry between him and the beatles principally paul mccartney the bside dont worry baby was cited by wilson in a 1970 interview as probably the best record weve donethe increasing pressures of wilsons career and personal life pushed him to a psychological breaking point he had ceased writing surfingthemed material after dont back down in april and during the groups first major european tour in late 1964 replied angrily to a journalist when asked how he felt about originating the surfing sound wilson resented being identified with surf and car songs explaining that he had only intended to produce a sound that teens dig and that can be applied to any theme were just gonna stay on the life of a social teenager he later described himself as a mr everything that had been so run down mentally and emotionally to the point where i had no peace of mind and no chance to actually sit down and think or even rest adding to his concerns was the groups business operations and the quality of their records which he believed suffered from this arrangement on december 7 in an effort to bring himself more emotional stability wilson impulsively married marilyn rovell on december 23 wilson was to accompany his bandmates on a twoweek us tour but while on a flight from los angeles to houston began sobbing uncontrollably over his marriage al jardine who had sat next to wilson on the plane later said none of us had ever witnessed something like that wilson played the show in houston later that day but was replaced by session musician glen campbell for the rest of the tour dates at the time wilson described it as the first of a series of three breakdowns i had when the group resumed recording their next album in january 1965 wilson declared to his bandmates that he would be withdrawing from future tours he later told a journalist that his decision had been a byproduct of his fucked up jealousy toward spector and the beatles growing drug use lsd and religious epiphany in 1965 wilson immediately showcased great advances in his musical development with the albums the beach boys today march and summer days and summer nights june campbell remained on tour with the band until he was no longer able to in february as a thanks wilson produced a single for campbell in march guess im dumb after which the band recruited columbia records staff producer bruce johnston as wilsons substitute on tour in february march july and october wilson rejoined the live group for oneoff occasionswith his bandmates often away on tour wilson distanced himself socially from the other beach boys since the autumn of 1964 he had moved from the rovells home to a onebedroom apartment at 7235 hollywood boulevard and given his newfound independence had begun forming a new social circle for himself through the industry connections he had accumulated biographer steven gaines writes brian had total freedom from family restraints for the first time he was finally able to make a new set of friends without parental interference by gary ushers account wilson had had few close friends and was like a piece of clay waiting to be molded by the end of the year wilson was one of the most successful influential and soughtafter young musicians in los angeles however a wider public recognition of wilsons talents eluded him until 1966wilson stated that a lot of his friends who were drug users had turned him on to drugs while he had been touring with the group beforehand according to mike love wilson had been known to be strictly opposed to drugs wilsons closest friend in this period was loren schwartz a talent agent that he had met at a hollywood studio through schwartz wilson was exposed to a wealth of literature and mystical topics largely of philosophy and world religions that he formed a deep fascination with schwartz also introduced marijuana and hashish to wilson whose habitual use of the drug caused a rift in his marriage to marilyn further strained by his frequent visitations to schwartzs apartment beginning with please let me wonder 1965 wilson wrote songs while under the influence of marijuana as his 2016 memoir suggested smoking a little bit of pot changed the way i heard arrangements his drug use was initially kept hidden from the rest of his family and group early in 1965 a few weeks after wilson and his wife moved into a new apartment on west hollywoods gardner street wilson took the psychedelic drug lsd or acid for the first time under schwartz supervision schwartz recalled that wilsons dosage was 125 micrograms of pure owsley and that his first experience included the fullon ego death marilyn recalled that wilson returned home the next day and recounted his experience telling her repeatedly that his mind was blown and that he had seen god in wilsons words i took lsd and it just tore my head off you just come to grips with what you are what you can do and cant do and learn to face itduring his first acid trip wilson went to a piano and devised the riff for the bands next single california girls he later described the instrumental tracking for the song held on april 6 as my favorite session and the opening orchestral section as the greatest piece of music that ive ever written for the remainder of the year he experienced considerable paranoia wilsons 2016 memoir states that he refrained from dropping lsd for a second time until he was twentythree in 1966 or 1967 marilyn believed that her husband likely took dozens of lsd trips in the subsequent years although she had been only aware of the two trips at the time conversely brians second wife melinda ledbetter claimed in 2004 that brian took only three lsd trips in his lifetimefollowing unsuccessful attempts to dissuade him from his constant fraternizing with schwartz marilyn separated from brian for at least a month she later said he was not the same brian that he was before the drugs these people were very hurtful and i tried to get that through to brian in mid1965 at the suggestion of four freshmen manager bill wagner brian consulted with a ucla psychiatrist on the adverse effects of lsd the psychiatrist later told wagner i dont know if he is savable he gives me the impression hes been on it for a while and hes entirely enamored of it speaking in 1966 wilson said that he had developed an interest in pills for the purpose of selfdiscovery not recreation and believed that the usage of psychedelics wont hurt you pet sounds genius campaign and smile brian and marilyn eventually reconciled and in october 1965 moved into a new home at 1448 laurel way in beverly hills wilson said that he spent five months planning an album that would reflect his growing interest in the making of music for people on a spiritual level he recalled having an unexpected rush of creative ideas and that he didnt mind the constant presence of visitors at his home so long as there werent too many and provided i could cop out and sit thinking i had a big spanish table and i sat there hour after hour making the tunes inside my head i was taking a lot of drugs fooling around with pills a lot of pills and it fouled me up for a while it got me really introspectivein december 1965 tony asher a jingle writer whom wilson had recently met accepted wilsons offer to be his writing partner for what became the beach boys next album pet sounds may 1966 he produced most of pet sounds from january to april 1966 at four hollywood studios mainly employing his bandmates on vocals and his usual pool of session musicians for the backing tracks among the album tracks he later described lets go away for awhile as the most satisfying piece of music he had made to date and i just wasnt made for these times as an autobiographical song about a guy who was crying because he thought he was too advanced in 1995 he referred to caroline no as probably the best ive ever written released in march 1966 the albums first single caroline no marked the first record credited to wilson as a solo artist it led to speculation that he was considering leaving the band wilson recalled i explained to the rest of the group its ok it is only a temporary rift where i have something to say i wanted to step out of the group a little bit and sure enough i was able to caroline no ultimately stalled at number 32 in the us pet sounds faced similarly underwhelming sales wilson was mortified that his artistic growth failed to translate into a numberone album according to marilyn when it wasnt received by the public the way he thought it would be received it made him hold back but he didnt stop he couldnt stop he needed to create morethanks to mutual connections wilson had been introduced to the beatles former press officer derek taylor who was subsequently employed as the beach boys publicist responding to brians request to inspire a greater public appreciation for his talents taylor initiated a media campaign that proclaimed wilson to be a genius taylors prestige was crucial in offering a credible perspective to those on the outside and his efforts are widely recognized as instrumental in the albums success in britain in turn however wilson resented that the branding had the effect of creating higher public expectations for himself the fact that the music press had begun undervaluing the contributions of the rest of the group also frustrated him and his bandmates including love and carl wilson for the remainder of 1966 wilson focused on completing the bands single good vibrations which became a numberone hit in december and a new batch of songs written with session musician van dyke parks for inclusion on smile the album planned to follow pet sounds wilson touted the album as a teenage symphony to god and continued to involve more people in his social business and creative affairs parks said that eventually it wasnt just brian and me in a room it was brian and me and all kinds of selfinterested people pulling him in various directions television producer david oppenheim who attended these scenes to film the documentary inside pop the rock revolution 1967 characterized wilsons home as a playpen of irresponsible people 19661973 decline home studio transition smile was never finished due in large part to wilsons worsening mental condition and exhaustion his friends family and colleagues often date the projects unraveling and wilsons onset of erratic behavior to around november 1966 namely when he recorded the wouldbe album track mrs olearys cow or fire in april 1967 wilson and his wife put their laurel way home up for sale and took residence at a newly purchased mansion on 10452 bellagio road in bel air wilson also set to work on constructing a personal home studio by then most of his new contacts had disassociated or were exiled from his social circle in may derek taylor announced that the sixmonthsoverdue smile album had been scrapped wilson explained in a 1968 interview we pulled out of that production pace really because i was about ready to die i was trying so hard so all of a sudden i decided not to try any more the underwhelming critical and commercial response to the bands july single heroes and villains has been cited as another exacerbating factor in wilsons professional and psychological declinestarting with smiley smile september 1967 the band made wilsons home their primary base of recording operations until 1972 the album was also the first in which production was credited to the entire group instead of wilson alone producer terry melcher attributed this change to wilsons selfconsciousness over his reputation unwilling to put his stamp on records so that peers will have a brian wilson track to criticize in august wilson rejoined the live band for two oneoff appearances in honolulu the shows were recorded for a planned live album leid in hawaii that was never finished during the sessions for wild honey december brian requested carl to contribute more to the recordmaking process brian also attempted to produce an album for singer danny huttons new group redwood but after the recording of three songs including time to get alone and darlin this motion was halted by mike love and carl wilson who wanted brian to focus on the beach boys contractual obligations friends june 1968 was recorded during a period of emotional recovery for wilson although it included more contributions from the rest of the group he actively led the studio sessions even on the songs that he did not write he later referred to it as his second solo album the first being pet sounds as well as his favorite beach boys album institutionalization and bedroom tapes for the remainder of 1968 wilsons songwriting output declined substantially as did his emotional state leading him to selfmedicate with the excessive consumption of food alcohol and drugs amid the looming financial insolvency of the beach boys he began to supplement his regular use of amphetamines and marijuana with cocaine hutton who had introduced wilson to cocaine recalled that wilson expressed suicidal wishes at the time and that it was when his real decline startedin mid1968 wilson was admitted to a psychiatric hospital possibly of his own volition his issues were not disclosed to the public and sessions for 2020 february 1969 continued in his absence journalist nik cohn writing in 1968 said that wilson had been rumored to be increasingly withdrawn brooding hermitic and occasionally he is to be seen in the back of some limousine cruising around hollywood bleary and unshaven huddled way tight into himself once discharged later in the year wilson rarely finished any tracks for the band leaving much of his subsequent output for carl wilson to complete regarding brians participation in the groups recordings from that time band engineer stephen desper said that brian remained indirectly involved with production through carl the bathrobeclad wilson would occasionally appear from his bedroom to preview a new song for the group an event that melcher likened to aesop delivering a new fable otherwise he stayed in his bedroom upstairs while his bandmates recorded in the studio down below he would occasionally visit a session if he had heard a piece of music that he felt should be changedconversely dennis wilson recalled that his elder brother began to have no involvement at all with the beach boys which forced the group to find things that he worked on and try and piece it together marilyn wilson recalled that her husband withdrew because of perceived resentment from the group it was like ok you assholes you think you can do as good as me or whatever go ahead you do it you think its so easy you do it referencing the accusation that the beach boys refused to let brian work dennis said i would go to his house daily and beg what can i do to help you i said forget recording forget all of it it got to brians healthjournalist brian chidester coined bedroom tapes as a loose umbrella term for wilsons subsequent unreleased output until 1975 despite the fact that his home studio was dismantled in 1972 much of the material that wilson recorded from the epoch remains unreleased and unheard by the public chidester states that some of it has been described as schizophrenia on tape and intensely personal songs of gentle humanism and strange experimentation which reflected on his thenfragile emotional state wilsons daughter wendy remembered where other people might take a run to release some stress he would go to the piano and write a 5minute song radiant radish and sunflower early in 1969 the beach boys commenced recording their album sunflower august 1970 wilson was an active participant in the yearlong sessions writing more than an albums worth of material by himself or with collaborators most of which was left off the record he recorded a single for the band break away that was cowritten with his father after which he was rarely in the studio until august 1969 due to his poor reputation in the music industry the beach boys struggled to secure a record contract with another label in may he revealed to reporters that the group were on the verge of bankruptcy his remarks had the effect of ruining negotiations with deutsche grammophon and nearly compromised the bands imminent tour of the uk and europe in july wilson opened a shortlived health food store the radiant radish with his friend arnie geller and cousin steve korthof in august sea of tunes the bands publishing company that held the rights to their song catalog was sold to irving almo music for 700000 equivalent to 517 million in 2021 wilson signed the consent letter at his fathers behest according to marilyn the sale devastated brian it killed him killed him i dont think he talked for days brian took it as a personal thing murry not believing in him anymore around this period wilson attempted to drive his vehicle off a cliff and on another occasion demanded that he be pushed into and buried in a grave that he had dug in his backyard he channeled his despondence into the writing of his song til i die which he described as the summation of everything i had to say at the timelater in 1969 wilson produced a collection of spokenword recordings a world of peace must come for poet stephen kalinich in november wilson and his band signed to reprise records a subsidiary of warner bros part of the contract stipulated wilsons proactive involvement with the group in all albums van dyke parks who brokered the deal said that they the band were considered a problem at that time everyone at the label just wanted brian wilson to come over and write some songs before the contract was effectuated wilson attended a band meeting with reprise executives with his face painted bright green asked why he did this wilson responded just seeing what would happenwilson briefly substituted for love on the road in march 1970 later calling the experience the best three days of my life i guess in april he attempted to produce a country and western album for the bands comanager fred vail cows in the pasture that was never finished in mid1970 wilson was reported to be working on a chorus of frogs piece for kalinich and contemplated scoring an andy warhol film about a homosexual surfer spring and holland stay wilson was deeply affected by the poor commercial response to sunflower and resumed having minimal contributions to the beach boys records bruce johnston characterized him as merely a visitor to the sessions for surfs up august 1971 in november 1970 wilson joined the live band for oneandahalf dates at the whisky a go go following this wilson told melody maker that although he had been quite happy living at home he felt that he was not as creative as i once was and im not participating as much as i should have done he identified himself as a kind of dropout who sleeps into the afternoon and potters around doing nothing muchspeaking to a reporter one year later in september 1971 wilson said that he had recently returned to arranging doing that more than writing now in december while at a concert in long beach manager jack rieley coaxed wilson into performing with the beach boys although his time on stage lasted only minutes in february 1972 wilson went to an america gig at the whisky a go go according to dan peek he held court like a mad king as danny hutton scurried about like his court jester during the bands performancefrom late 1971 to early 1972 wilson and musician david sandler collaborated on spring the first album by marilyn wilson and diane rovells new group american spring as with much of brians work in the era his contributions ebbed and flowed it was the most involved wilson had been in an albums production since friends in 1968 meanwhile blondie chaplin stated that wilson rarely left his bedroom during the recording of carl and the passions april 1972 but when he came down his contribution was amazing wilsons unavailability was such that his image had to be superimposed into the group portrait included in the records inner sleeveduring the summer of 1972 wilson joined his bandmates when they temporarily moved base to holland albeit after much cajoling while living in a dutch house called flowers and listening repeatedly to randy newmans newest album sail away wilson was inspired to write a fairy tale mount vernon and fairway loosely based on his memories listening to the radio at mike loves family home as a teenager the group rejected his proposal to include the fairy tale on their next album holland january 1973 instead it was packaged with holland as a bonus ep in 1973 jan berry under the alias jan released the single dont you just know it a duet featuring wilson that april wilson briefly joined his bandmates onstage during an encore for the groups concert at the hollywood palladium 19731975 recluse period after his fathers death in june 1973 wilson secluded himself in the chauffeurs quarters of his home where he spent his time sleeping abusing drugs and alcohol overeating and exhibiting selfdestructive behavior he rarely ventured outside wearing anything but pajamas and later said that his fathers death had a lot to do with my retreating wilsons family were eventually forced to take control of his financial affairs due to his irresponsible drug expenditures this led brian to occasionally wander the city begging for rides drugs and alcohol according to wilson from 1974 to 1975 he recorded only skimpy little bits and pieces little fragments due to a loss of the ability to concentrate enough to follow through reflecting on this period wilson said that he was preoccupied with snorting cocaine reading magazines such as playboy and penthouse and hanging out with danny hutton whose laurel canyon house had become the center of wilsons social life although increasingly reclusive during the day wilson spent many nights at huttons house fraternizing with colleagues such as alice cooper and iggy pop who were mutually bemused by an extended wilsonled singalong of the folk song shortnin bread according to cooper wilson proclaimed that it was the greatest song ever written other visitors of huttons home included harry nilsson john lennon ringo starr and keith moon on several occasions marilyn wilson sent her friends to climb huttons fence and retrieve her husbandof wilson in the early 1970s music historian charles granata writes the storiesmany of them dubiousare legendary wilson stated in a 2001 interview that he had never met john lennon however cooper told another story in which he had witnessed wilson at a party with lennon repeatedly asking fellow attendees to introduce him to the beatle one after another micky dolenz recalling an occasion in which he took lsd with wilson nilsson and lennon in malibu said that wilson played just one note on a piano over and over again john sebastian often showed up at wilsons home to jam and later recalled of wilsons situation it wasnt all grimness jeff foskett then a beach boys fan who had visited wilsons home unannounced said that wilson was cordial and belied the popular myths surrounding him a perception reaffirmed by wilsons mistress at the time debbie keilpaul mccartney and his wife linda visited wilson in april 1974 but wilson refused to let them inside his home jimmy webb reported wilsons presence at an august session for nilssons salmon falls he kept in the back of the studio playing da doo ron ron haphazardly on a b3 organ later that month he played on the sessions for keith moons solo album two sides of the moon and was photographed at moons 28th birthday party held on august 28 at the beverly wilshire hotel wearing only his bathrobe on another occasion that year wilson interrupted a set by jazz musician larry coryell at the troubadour by leaping on stage and singing bebopalula again wearing slippers and a bathrobe musician todd rundgren who had accompanied wilson to the concert later wrote in his memoir ive wondered since the troubadour incident whether the nature of the music had an effect on brians actions perhaps his behavior was actually a precursor to the blurring of the line between audience and performer that the punk movement engendered perhaps i had witnessed the birth of a revolutionthe beach boys greatest hits compilation endless summer was a surprise success becoming the bands second numberone us album in october 1974 to take advantage of their sudden resurgence in popularity wilson agreed to join his bandmates in colorado for the recording of a new album at james william guercios caribou ranch studio the group completed a few tracks including child of winter christmas song but ultimately abandoned the project released as a single at the end of december 1974 child of winter was their first record that displayed the credit produced by brian wilson since 1966early in 1975 while still under contract with warner bros wilson signed a shortlived sideline production deal with bruce johnston and terry melchers equinox records together they founded the looseknit supergroup known as california music which also included involvement from gary usher curt boettcher and other los angeles musicians along with his guest appearances on johnny rivers rendition of help me rhonda and jackie deshannons boat to sail wilsons production of california musics single why do fools fall in love represents his only serious work throughout this period of semiinactivityan event that wilson remembered as the most embarrassing in his life was when he met elvis presley at rca victor studio in 1975 when presley was recording pieces of my life wilson was accordingly so nervous that he attempted to karate chop the singer also in 1975 nme published an extended threepart piece by journalist nick kent the last beach movie which depicted wilson in a highly unfavorable light johnston stated in another music magazine that wilson became suicidally depressed after reading the article 19751982 brians back 15 big ones love you and adultchild wilsons overconsumption of food cigarettes alcohol and other drugs which now sometimes included heroin further strained his marriage to marilyn who responded by threatening her husband with divorce or committing him to a mental institution by then wilsons weight had ballooned to 240 pounds 110 kg to help reverse his physical decline in 1975 band manager stephen love appointed his brother stan a basketball player as wilsons bodyguard trainer and caretaker marilyn also called in the bands lawyers and accountants to remind her husband that pursuant to the terms of his contract with warner bros he was legally obliged to write and produce for the beach boys or else he would be sued by the label and lose his home stan was successful in improving wilsons health but after several months went back to working with the nba wilson then volunteered into psychologist eugene landys radical 24hour therapy program in october under landys care wilson became more stable and socially engaged with his productivity increasing once again throughout 1976 the tagline brians back became a major promotional tool for the bands concert tours as well as their july release 15 big ones the first beach boys album that credited wilson as the sole producer since pet sounds the sessions were fraught with tension as wilsons bandmates fought against his wish to record a covers album and did not feel that he was ready to assume control of their studio proceedings ultimately a compromise was reached with the album including a mix of covers and originalsstarting on july 2 1976 wilson made regular concert appearances with his bandmates for the first time since december 1964 singing and alternating between bass guitar and piano in august wilson traveled with his group for concert dates outside of california the first time he had done so since march 1970 nbc also premiered a lorne michaelsproduced television special about the band called simply the beach boys which included recent concert footage interviews and a comedy sketch involving wilson and nbcs saturday night cast members dan aykroyd and john belushi despite its success the brians back promotion proved controversial wilsons remarks to interviewers suggested that he had yet to fully recover from his addictions and he remarked on one occasion that he felt like a prisoner a concert reviewer noted that wilson seemed uncomfortable on stage and contributed nil from october 1976 to january 1977 wilson produced a large collection of studio recordings largely by himself while his bandmates were preoccupied with other personal and creative affairs released in april 1977 the beach boys love you was the beach boys first album to feature wilson as a primary composer since wild honey in 1967 originally titled brian loves you wilson played virtually all of the instruments on the album once again he was credited as producer although carl was credited as mixdown producer band engineer earle mankey described it as brian wilson giving what he had to make a serious autobiographical album asked for his favorite beach boys albums in a 1998 interview wilson responded with 15 big ones and love youwilsons family and management relieved landy of his services at the end of 1976 when he raised his monthly fees to 20000 equivalent to 95000 in 2021 shortly afterward wilson told a journalist that he felt the treatment had been a success despite the exorbitant fees landys role as wilsons handler and constant supervisor was immediately taken over by wilsons cousins steve korthof and stan love and a professional model rocky pamplin who had been friends with love in college wilson maintained a healthy drugfree disposition for several months under their auspicesin early 1977 wilson produced adultchild the intended followup to love you but it was kept unreleased due to artistic disputes in march the beach boys signed to cbs records whose contract stipulated that wilson compose most of the material on all of the groups albums according to gaines when brian signed the contract he cried knowing he would now have to go back to the studio fulltime referencing the sessions for miu album october 1978 wilson said that he went through a mental blankout during this period wilson was credited as the albums executive producer likely for contractual reasons stan said that wilson was depressed and didnt want to write with mike anymore but of course mike tried to hang on around this time wilson attempted to produce an album for pamplin that would have featured the honeys as backing vocalists hospitalizations and cocaine sessions wilson entered a period of regression over the subsequent years particularly after the bands disastrous tour of australia in 1978 and found ways of obtaining cocaine and barbiturates without the knowledge of his handlers in mid1978 a day after he overdosed on a combination of drugs he disappeared from his family and went hitchhiking in west hollywood ultimately arriving at a gay bar where he played piano for drinks after this he was driven to mexico by a bar patron and then hitchhiked to san diego days later police officers discovered wilson lying under a tree in balboa park without shoes money or a wallet they promptly took him to alvarado hospital for detox from alcohol poisoning once discharged wilson immediately joined his bandmates for the recording of la light album march 1979 but after producing some demos requested that

and a joint and tell dennis he shouldnt drink according to stebbins the brothers held secret recording sessions together these were concealed due to the fact that no effort was spared to keep brian

audreenumerous reports from this period suggested that wilson was being pressured to have a career and exploited by those close to him including melinda wilsons daughter carnie referred to ledbetter as melandy and ginger blake a family friend characterized wilson as complacent and basically surrendered mike love stated that he was in favor of reuniting the beach boys with wilson however brian usually has someone in his life who tells him what to do and now that person kinda wants to keep him away from us i dont know why youd have to ask her i guess asked if he still considered himself a beach boy wilson replied no maybe a little bit referencing wilsons longtime dependencies on his father and landy westwords michael roberts wrote in 2000 that his public statements over time have

write an overture arrangement of wilsons songs critic geoff edgers wrote that the historical importance of the tour was comparable to that of syd barrett or jd salinger emerging from their decadeslong reclusion although the tour was positively received by critics it was poorly attended and financial losses ran up to hundreds of thousands of dollars in march 2001 wilson attended a tribute show held in his honor at the radio city music hall in new york where he sang heroes and villains before a public audience for the first time in decadesthe pet sounds tour was followed by another in 2002 this

joined by parks who was brought in to contribute additional lyrics brian wilson presents smile bwps premiered at the royal festival hall in london in february 2004 encouraged by the positive reception a studio album adaptation was soon recorded wilsons engineer mark linett recalled that when he handed wilson the cd of the completed album i swear you could see something change in him and hes been

concert tour in which he performed the album in its entirety in october 2011 the record was followed by in the key of disney which peaked at number 83 in the us the album was largely overshadowed by the release of the smile sessions one week later whether wilson had truly consented to his semiregular touring schedule since the 2000s remained a subject of debate among fans wilson himself frequently stated that he enjoyed live performances however writing in his 2011 book about the beach boys jon stebbins concluded his handlers managers and wife insist that he works its all a bit landylike when you look behind the curtain stebbins referred to a recent interview in which brian was asked what he disliked the most about touring and brian replied that it was going on stage and performing upon hearing brian say that his handler quickly reminded brian through a fake smile that he loved performing asked about wilsons alleged exploitation in an interview jeff foskett denied the reportsin mid2011 wilson reunited with his bandmates to rerecord do it again surreptitiously for a potential 50th anniversary album rumors that the group would reunite for a world tour soon appeared

between wilson and joe thomas featuring guest appearances from jardine marks chaplin and others fans reacted negatively to the announcement that wilson would be recording a duets album describing it as a cashin a facebook post attributed to wilson responded to the feedback in my life in music ive been told too many times not to fuck with the formula but as an artist its my job to do that the album reached the us top 30 but critical reaction was mixed due to the adult contemporary arrangements and excessive use of autotune later in the year sahanaja was asked if wilson was reaching the end of his career as a performing artist he answered i gotta be honest each of the past five years i thought to myself well this is probably going to be it in march 2016 wilson embarked on the pet sounds 50th anniversary world tour promoted as his final performances of the album in october his second memoir i am brian wilson was published it was written by journalist ben greenman through several months of interviews with wilson also in october wilson announced a new album sensitive music for sensitive people comprising originals and rock and roll cover songs he described the name as a working title and said that recording would begin in decemberasked about negative remarks made against him in wilsons book love disputed that wilsons printed statements were actually spoken by him and suggested that wilson is not in charge of his life like i am mine but i dont like to put undue pressure on him because i know he has a lot of issues during the filming of the 2021 documentary brian wilson long promised road wilson remarked that he had not had a friend to talk to in three yearsin a 2016 rolling stone interview wilson responded to a question about retiring retirement oh man no retiring if i retired i wouldnt know what to do with my time what would i do sit there and go oh i dont want to be 74 id rather get on the road and do concerts and take airplane flights similarly in 2017 wilson told rolling stone that he had not written a song since 2012 but still had no intentions of retiring from the road in 2019 wilson embarked on a coheadlining tour with the zombies performing selections from friends and surfs uparound this time wilson had two back surgeries that left him unable to get around without a walker wilson was still performing concerts shows at the time the covid19 pandemic emerged in early 2020 he resumed his concert touring in august 2021 with many dates rescheduled to the next year two releases followed in november the first at my piano was issued by decca and consists of new instrumental rerecordings of wilsons songs played by himself on piano the second was the soundtrack to long promised road which includes new and previously unreleased recordings by wilson 2022present retirement from touring on july 26 2022 wilson played his final concert as part of a joint tour with chicago at the pine knob music theatre in clarkston michigan where he was reported to have sat rigid and expressionless throughout the performance days later he cancelled his remaining tour dates for that year with his management citing unforeseen health reasons as the reason during a january 2023 appearance on a beach boys fan podcast wilsons daughter carnie reported that her father was probably not going to tour anymore which is heartbreaking artistry influences early influences chordwise wilsons main music influences come from rock and roll doowop and vocalbased jazz at about age two he heard glenn millers 1943 rendition of gershwins rhapsody in blue which had a profound emotional impact on him wilson said it sort of became a general life theme for me as a child his favorite artists included roy rogers carl perkins bill haley elvis presley henry mancini and rosemary clooney asked for the first music that he had felt compelled to learn and sing repeatedly wilson answered with haleys 1954 recording of rock around the clock most of wilsons education in music composition and jazz harmony came from deconstructing the harmonies of his favorite vocal group the four freshmen whose repertoire included songs by gershwin jerome kern and cole porterwilson credited his mother with introducing him to the four freshmen and he attributed his love for harmonies and the human voice to the group whom he considered had a groovy sectional sound their 1956 album freshmen favorites was the first pop album that wilson listened to in its entirety and he cited voices in love 1958 as probably the greatest single vocal album ive ever heard he referred to their arranger dick reynolds as just about a god to me and later employed his services for the beach boys christmas album and adultchild it is likely that wilson learned virtually the entirety of the four freshmens recorded repertoire up through 1961 after which his obsession with the group was reducedinquired for his music tastes in 1961 wilson replied top 10 referring to essentially any of the top hits of the era particular favorites included many songs by chuck berry the coasters and the everly brothers later in his career wilson recorded renditions of certain favorites including the everly brothers devoted to you 1958 the robins smokey joes cafe 1955 the olympics hully gully 1960 the shirelles mama said 1961 and the regents barbara ann 1961he disliked surf music when the beach boys began forming in the estimation of biographer timothy white wilson instead aspired for a new plateau midway between gershwin and the best four freshmen material gershwins influence became more apparent in wilsons music later in his career particularly after the 1970s when he dedicated himself to learning the violin parts from rhapsody in blue for the first time in 1994 wilson recorded a choral version of rhapsody in blue with van dyke parks spector and bacharach phil spectors influence on wilson is welldocumented in a 1966 article wilson referred to spector as the single most influential producer he reaffirmed in 2000 that spector was probably the biggest influence of all anybody with a good ear can hear that i was influenced by spector i would listen to his records and pick up ideas wilson particularly admired spectors treatment of the song as one giant instrument size was so important to him how big everything sounded and he had the best drums i ever heard he often cited spectors christmas album as his favorite album of all time wilson stated that he was made aware of spectors records via bob norberg according to white the crystals spectorproduced hit hes a rebel 1962 hit brian hardest when it was released wilson recalled that when he heard the ronettes 1963 hit be my baby for the first time through his car radio he immediately pulled over to the side of the road and deemed it the greatest record he had ever heard his 2016 memoir states that he met spector only a few days latermost accounts suggest that spector had not shared the same admiration for wilsons music but according to larry levine brian was one of the few people in the music business phil respected phil would tell anybody who listened that brian was one of the great producers he remembered that when wilson attended spectors sessions wilson would ask questions but he always understood what was happening in the studio they had a good rapportafter spectors youve lost that lovin feelin 1964 became a hit for the righteous brothers wilson personally phoned spectors cowriters barry mann and cynthia weil to praise it as the greatest record ever and expressed a wish to be their cowriter on future songs wilson unsuccessfully submitted two of his compositions to the producer dont worry baby and dont hurt my little sister both written with the ronettes in mind in 1977 wilson wrote a 1950s style love song mona whose lyrics discuss some of his favorite songs by spector including da doo ron ron and be my baby burt bacharach is among the oftenoverlooked influences on wilsons music he named bacharach along with spector and chuck berry as his main influences chordwise in 1966 he said burt bacharach and hal david are more like me theyre also the best pop team per se today as a producer bacharach has a very fresh new approach he later said that bacharachs work had a profound influence that got me going in a different direction wilson produced renditions of bacharachs my little red book and walk on by in 1967 and 1968 respectively but left the recordings unreleased asked for anybodys songs that he wished he had written he listed three youve lost that lovin feelin be my baby and bacharachs here i am others although it is often reported that the beach boys and the beatles reciprocated each others musical developments wilson rebuked the suggestion that he had been influenced by his rivals the beatles inspired me they didnt influence me carl wilson supported that his brother preferred the music of phil spector over the beatles he loved the beatles later music when they evolved and started making intelligent masterful music but before that phil was it in a 1969 interview mike love rejected the notion of brian being influenced by the beatles adding that brian was in his own world believe mewilson acknowledged that he was highly selfconscious of the beatles as a cultural force he recalled that he and mike love immediately felt threatened by the beatles and added that he knew the beach boys could never match the excitement created by the beatles as performers and that this realization led him to concentrate his efforts on trying to outdo them in the recording studio in a 2002 interview wilson said that each new beatles release particularly over 196465 pushed him to try something new in his work he praised paul mccartneys bass playing calling it technically fantastic but his harmonies and the psychological thing he brings to the music comes through psychologically he is really strong the other thing that i could never get was how versatile he was we would spend ages trying to work out where he got all those different types of songs fromgranata writes that wilson also admired frankie valli and the four seasons although wilson rarely singled them out in interviews wilson has referred to motown as another influence cultural historian hal lifson argued that wilsons symphonic element was influenced by disney film soundtracks such as mary poppins 1964 in 1986 wilson told ethnomusicologist david toop i listened to a lot of orchestral music i learned a lot of tricks too nelson riddle taught me a lot about arranging asked about soul music in 2004 he cited smokey robinson and stevie wonder as influences wendy carloss 1969 album switchedon bach described by wilson as one of the most electrifying records he had ever heard influenced his use of synthesizersin 1976 wilson commented that he felt contemporary popular music had lacked the artistic integrity it once had with queens bohemian rhapsody 1975 being one exception in a 1988 interview he named the 1982 compilation stevie wonders original musiquarium i and paul simons 1986 release graceland among his ten favorite albums of all time in 2007 he cited billy joel as his favorite pianist as of 2015 wilson maintained that he does not listen to modern music only oldies but goodies singing through listening to four freshmen records wilson developed a distinctive singing stylea versatile head voice that allowed him to sing high without engaging in falsetto although he did also sing in falsetto on some beach boys songs wilson recalled that he learned how to sing falsetto through listening to the four freshmens renditions of songs like im always chasing rainbows ill remember april and day by day another strong influence was rosemary clooney whom he said taught me to sing with love in my heart i would sing along with her recording of hey there studying her phrasing and thats how i learned to sing with feeling in 1966 he said that the highest note he could sing was d5wilson typically sang in a pure tenor voice until later in his adult life when he began invoking his tenor only on rare occasions he was sometimes embarrassed by his singing as he was worried of being perceived as a homosexual and would avoid performing in a high voice for this reason after the early 1970s wilsons voice degraded due to his excessive consumption of cigarettes and cocaine 15 big ones marked the introduction of what biographer peter ames carlin terms wilsons baritone croak in a 1999 interview wilson remarked you know bob dylan well live you know he sort of has this harsh raspy voice thats what i have im like the bob dylan of the 90s songwriting musical structures explaining his writing process in 1966 wilson stated that he started with finding a basic chord pattern and rhythm that he described as feels or brief note sequences fragments of ideas and once theyre out of my head and into the open air i can see them and touch them firmly theyre not feels anymore he wrote that he aspired to write songs that appear simple no matter how complex it really is in a 2009 interview he stated that his favorite chord is e major seventh while his favorite key signatures to play in are b c e and e common devices in wilsons musical structures include jazz chords such as sevenths and ninths chord inversions especially a tonic with a fifth in the bass prominent melodic bass parts functional ambiguity key changes within verse and choruses including truck drivers modulations i iv i v chord progressions derived from da doo ron ron a circle of fifths run that begins with the mediant iii derived from be my baby stepwisefalling melodic lines stepwise diatonic rises such as i iii iv v wholestep root movement such as i vii vi v tertian movement chromatic harmony including diminished seventh chords chromatic bass descents most prominently demonstrated in our prayer alternations between supertonic and dominant chords ii v or tonic and flattened subtonic chords i vii sudden breaks into a cappella another technique borrowed from the four freshmen syncopated exercises and counterpoints piled on top of jittery eighthnote clusters and loping shuffle grooves features that producer alan boyd said took an almost manic edge in wilsons work during the 1970swilson also composed his own arrangements an unusual practice among rock groups of the 1960s lyrics wilson typically wrote songs in conjunction with another lyricist although there are several examples of songs in which he composed both the music and words alone including surfer girl girl dont tell me im bugged at my ol man busy doin nothin this whole world til i die and love and mercy in his 2008 book dark mirror the pathology of the singersongwriter donald brackett identifies wilson as the carl sandburg and robert frost of popular musicdeceptively simple colloquial in phrasing with a spare and evocative lyrical style embedded in the culture that created it most of wilsons songs relate to introspective themes although the beach boys were known for their surfing imagery his songs typically avoided such topics when he wrote with collaborators outside of his bands circle such as in the 1963 songs lonely sea and in my room in several of his other songs the male object or narrator is portrayed as a loser such as on she knows me too well dont hurt my little sister merry christmas baby and all dressed up for school brackett argues that although john lennon came close there have been very few singersongwriters that have expressed intense fragility or emotional vulnerability as deeply or severely as brian wilson didother recurring themes in wilsons songs include feminine objectification youthful innocence slice of life stories or observations and health and fitness unlike his contemporaries social issues were never referenced in his lyrics wilson acknowledged that he had never been the type to preach social messages in his songs recording in the 1960s studios and musicians on the subject of recording wilson said i was unable to really think as a producer up until the time where i really got familiar with phil spectors work that was when i started to design the experience to be a record rather than just a song wilson often attended spectors recording sessions taking notes on the producers arranging and recording methods later dubbed the wall of sound and adopted the same choice of studios and session musicians as spector this collective of studio musicians later became known as the wrecking crewrather than using gold star studios spectors favorite studio wilson preferred working at the studio 3 room of western for its privacy and for the presence of staff engineer chuck britz from 1962 to 1967 britz acted as wilsons righthand man although more technical recording details such as level mixing and microphone placement were usually handled by britz wilson would adjust the configuration to a large extent once britz assembled a preliminary recording setup wilson would take over the console directing the session musicians from the booth using an intercom or verbal gestures after supplying them with chord charts according to britz brian would work with the players until he got the sound he wanted the process often took hourswilson first used the wrecking crew for his productions with the honeys in march 1963 two months later during the sessions for surfer girl he began gradually integrating these musicians on the beach boys records still the band members almost always performed the instrumentation on their records until 1965 by then a typical wilson session would feature about 11 or more musicians in 1966 and 1967 wilson almost exclusively relied on the wrecking crew for the recording of the beach boys backing tracks after 1967 his use of these musicians was considerably reducedwilsons musicians many of whom had studied in conservatories were astounded by his abilities among them guitarist jerry cole said we would walk out of brians sessions shaking our heads saying this son of a bitch is either crazy or hes an absolute genius and the latter came to pass keyboardist don randi admired wilsons chord choices and referred to him as the bill evans of rock n roll bassist carol kaye remembered we had to create instrumental parts for all the other groups we cut for but not brian we were in awe of brian drummer hal blaine who was similarly amazed by wilsons talents slightly differed in his account of the players contributions everyone helped arrange as far as im concerned for his part wilson said that he would work out about a third of the finished arrangement of a song as he was writing it leaving the rest to studio experimentation production style wilsons bestknown productions typically employed instruments such as saxophones and bass harmonicas he usually instructed blaine to play only the snare and floortom afterbeats used on spectors records owing further to spectors influence wilson rarely used ride or crash cymbals in his work and often combined color tones such as a banjo doubled with a harpsichord to produce novel sounds among other practices that wilson copied directly from spector was recording two echo chambers simultaneously as well as having standup bass and fender bass play identical parts his bass parts were usually played with a hard plectrum giving the instrument a more percussive sound a practice he had drawn from motownstring ensembles were rarely used in wilsons productions prior to pet sounds and he did not usually record strings as part of the basic track instead preferring to overdub them afterward once the instrumental track was completed vocals would then be overdubbed beginning with the 1963 song surfin usa wilson doubletracked the vocals resulting in a deeper and more resonant sound according to wilson after his first nervous breakdown in 1964 he endeavored to take the things i learned from phil spector and use more instruments whenever i couldstarting in 1964 wilson performed tape splices on his recordings usually to allow difficult vocal sections to be performed by the group by 1965 he had become more adventurous in his use of tape splicing such as on the song and your dream comes true which was recorded in sections and then edited together to create the final song these experiments culminated with the similar but more complex editing processes adopted for good vibrations and smile mark linett who has engineered wilsons recordings since the 1980s stated he certainly wasnt the first person to do edits but it was unusual to record a song in four or five sections and then cut it togetherin priores assessment wilson reconfigured spectors wall of sound techniques in the pursuit of audio clarity and a more lush comfortable feel the 2003 book temples of sound states that wilson distinguished himself from spector through the usage of certain instruments such as banjo and that spectors productions do not possess the clean muscle of brians work danny hutton who attended many of wilsons recording sessions felt that wilsons engineering talents had been underrated by the public hutton noted somebody could go in right after brians session and try to record and they could never get the sound he got there was a lot of subtle stuff he did he was just handson he would change the reverb and the echo and all of a sudden something just whoa got twice as big and fat personal life deafness in right ear at age 11 during a christmas choir recital wilson was discovered to have significantly diminished hearing in his right ear a family doctor soon diagnosed the issue as a nerve impingement the cause is unclear theories range from it being a birth defect to him being struck by either his father or a neighborhood boyit is unlikely for wilson to have been born partially deaf since such congenital defects usually appear at an earlier age brians father murry offered he was injured in some football game or some injury of some kind or it just happened who knows according to brians mother audree brian thinks it happened when he was around ten some kid down the street really whacked him in the ear on another occasion audree said that the deafness was caused by murry hitting brian with an iron while brian was asleepone account from wilson suggested that the deafness was caused by his father slapping his ear shortly before his third birthday timothy white states that brian rarely discussed the issue with murry after the father had reacted so menacingly the one time brian had brought up the subject brian said of his father in a 2000 interview i was born deaf he hit me with a 24 but i was already deaf by that time in his 2016 memoir the blame is given to a neighborhood boydue to this infirmity wilson developed a habit of speaking from the side of his mouth giving the false impression that he had had a stroke he also had ringing in the ear that worsens when he is tired or subjected to loud noise in the late 1960s he underwent corrective surgery that was unsuccessful in restoring his hearing relationships and children wilsons first serious relationship was with judy bowles a girl he had met at a baseball game in mid1961 she inspired his songs judy 1962 surfer girl 1963 and the warmth of the sun 1964 during their relationship wilson gradually became more romantically involved with marilyn rovell a 14yearold high school student he had met in august 1962 wilsons all summer long 1964 nodded to their first meeting with the lyric remember when you spilled coke all over your blouse inspired by a remark from her older sister diane rovell wilson later wrote dont hurt my little sister 1965 about the affair wilson and bowles were engaged during christmas 1963 and planned to be married the next december but ultimately had separated by then wilson and marilyn were married in december 1964 together they had two daughters carnie and wendy born 1968 and 1969 respectively who later had musical success of their own as twothirds of the group wilson phillips wilson believed that he wasnt a good husband nor much of a father marilyn said that her husband completely backed out of the responsibility of raising their children because he felt that he was an unfit parent and would repeat the same mistakes of his own father biographer peter ames carlin referred to a disturbing anecdote printed in a 1971 rolling stone article in which brian discussed his childs sexual experiments brian had remarked it just goes to prove that if you dont hide anything from kids theyll start doing things they normally wouldnt do until much latermuch of the lyrical content from pet sounds reflected the couples early marital struggles a few years into his marriage to marilyn wilson encouraged her to have affairs with other men including songwriter tandyn almer in turn wilson had simultaneous affairs with diane and a teenage telephone operator named debbie keil to marilyns chagrin wilson permitted keils frequent visitations to the wilson household wilson wrote the night was so young 1977 about keil and her nightly visits and my diane 1978 about his affair with his sisterinlawinitially debbie keil had been a beach boys fan who according to biographer steven gaines had moved from kansas to los angeles with the purpose of getting close to wilson from 1969 to 1970 she worked for the band as a fan mail sorter keil ultimately contributed many of the anonymous insider quotes that were published in david leafs 1978 biography the beach boys and the california myth writing in the books 2022 revision leaf explained debbie never tried to shape the narrative i felt her observations were insightful very different from what id been readingsinger linda ronstadts 2013 memoir simple dreams implies that she briefly dated wilson in the 1970sin july 1978 wilson and marilyn separated with wilson filing for divorce in january 1979 marilyn was given custody of their children he subsequently maintained a relationship with keil until 1981 keil later told leaf i always felt that to survive as the girlfriend i would ultimately have to be a father figure for him every so often he seemed to always be looking for something to rebel against and withhold from i didnt have it in me following this wilson entered a relationship with one of his nurses a black woman named carolyn williams he had met in 1979 which lasted until january 1983 his 2016 memoir says of williams my head wasnt on straight at all and i would sometimes say stupid things to her once i got impatient and said get your black ass in there and make me lunch i apologized immediately but i didnt feel right about it she split pretty soon and it was mostly because of me im sorry about it even todaywilson initially dated former model and car saleswoman melinda kae ledbetter from 1986 to late 1989 ledbetter stated that the relationship ended prematurely due to interference from landy after wilson parted ways with his psychiatrist in 1991 he and ledbetter reconnected and were married on february 6 1995 since 1999 ledbetter has been wilsons manager a job which she has said is basically negotiating and thats what i did every single day when i sold cars they adopted five children daria rose born 1996 delanie rae born 1998 dylan born 2004 dash born 2009 and dakota rose born 2010 by 2012 wilson had six grandchildren two daughters of carnie and four sons of wendy beliefs wilson grew up in a presbyterian family later in various interviews he frequently emphasized the spiritual qualities of his music particularly with respect to pet sounds wilson also had a fascination with matters such as astrology numerology and the occult that was reflected in his original conceptions for smile in 1966 he stated that he believed all music starts with religion and that although he believed in some higher being who is better than we are he was not religious in a formal sense asked whether his music was religiously influenced in 1988 he referred to the 1962 book a toehold on zen and said that he believed that he possessed what is called a toehold he explained say somebody had a grasp on life a good graspthey ought to be able to transfer that over to another thing in 1990 wilson said that his lsd flirtations in the mid1960s led to him developing a jesus christ complex which was weird although he added to live is to be a christ to be aliveduring the late 1960s wilson joined his bandmates in the promotion of transcendental meditation tm in a 1968 interview he stated that religion and meditation were the same and felt relieved that all of society had attained a personal path to god something that he believed had not happened since i dont know how many millions of years or thousands or hundreds of years ago he recalled that he had already been initiated into tm beforehand but for some ridiculous reason i hadnt followed through with it and when you dont follow through with something you can get all clogged up wilson soon lost interest in tm saying that it just doesnt do shit for me ive given up on it he revealed to the public that his mantra was eyenehmah during a 1976 television appearance moments after declaring that the maharishi mahesh yogi had bestowed him the mantra and had asked him to keep it privatewilson described himself in 1976 as someone who had read too many books and went through a thing of having too many paths to choose from and of wanting to do everything and not being able to do it all he maintained that he still believed as he did in the 1960s that the coming of the great messiah came in the form of drugs even though his own drug experiences really didnt work out so well so positively according to friend stanley shapiro he and dennis once discovered a tape reel labelled song to god and attempted to play it in brians home brian immediately rushed in the room confiscated the tape and shouted dont you ever touch that again thats between me and god the tape has since been lost in a 1977 interview wilson promoted sexual deprivation as a means of becoming cosmically conscious in another interview from 1995 he revealed that abstinence was the secret to how he functions calling it an einsteinian formula that creates a void in your brainin 1999 when asked for his religious beliefs wilson responded i believe in phil spector asked again in 2011 he said that while he had spiritual beliefs he did not follow any particular religion asked in 2004 for his favorite book wilson answered the bible and questioned if he believed in life after death wilson replied i dontwilson wrote the warmth of the sun as a tribute to john f kennedy following his assassination in 1963 asked if he still drew inspiration from modern politics in 2011 wilson responded politics goes in one ear and out the other i dont even know the presidents name for sure laughs thats how stupid i am he voted for republican candidate john mccain during the 2008 us presidential elections mental health wilson is diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and mild manic depression he regularly experiences auditory hallucinations that present in the form of disembodied voices according to wilson he began having hallucinations at the age of 22 in 1965 shortly after starting to use psychedelic drugs but the age of 21 has also been reported part of his paranoid delusions involved the belief that these voices were satan coming in the form of other people that were competing with me and had ideas of killing me the messages from these imagined characters are mostly derogatory and sometimes positive wilson aware of the fact that they are fantasies referred to the voices as heroes and villains that had forced him into a life of scare asked in 2015 if these hallucinations had inspired songs wilson responded every now and thenaccording to gaines in his 1986 biography of the beach boys wilsons family and friends had often struggled to tell how much of his behavior was out of true craziness and how much was brians clever faking wilsons 1991 memoir suggests that his houston flight incident from december 1964 made him conscious of the fact that he could manipulate people to get my way through displays of craziness after the incident marilyn brought wilson to his first visit to a psychiatrist who ruled that wilsons condition was simply a byproduct of work fatigue wilson typically refused counseling and it had been long thought by his family that rather than mental illness his idiosyncrasies stemmed from his drug habits or were merely natural to his personalitymarilyn said that while brian had displayed instances of odd behavior she began having serious concerns about his mental wellbeing after the birth of their first child in 1968 later that year brian was admitted to a psychiatric hospital where he was prescribed thorazine for severe anxiety disorder carlin speculated that wilson may have selfadmitted and may have been administered treatments ranging from talking therapies to doses of lithium and electroconvulsive therapy during this stay responding to accusations of neglect marilyn stated that she had sought professional help for her husband for many years brians ability to put on these professionals made it difficult to find someone who could deal with him on his own level i am tired of hearing that brians problems were never addressed for those who say that were not there and do not know the truthfollowing his admission to landys program wilson was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia with doctors finding evidence of brain damage caused by excessive and sustained drug use the paranoid schizophrenia diagnosis was later retracted under landys regimen wilson developed facial tics called tardive dyskinesia that were symptomatic of the excessive psychotropic medications he was taking therapist peter reum a fan who had met wilson on several occasions stated that wilson would have deteroriated into a drooling palsied mental patient and died of heart failure had he continued this drug regimen however wilson intimated in a 2002 interview i dont regret the landy program i loved the guyhe saved me after wilson sought medical care elsewhere he was declared to have organic personality disorder musician sean ohagan who was invited to collaborate with wilson in the 1990s characterized wilson as totally dependent on other people and had a kinda weird adult autism wilsons mental condition improved in later years although his auditory hallucinations were not eliminated as the voices become more pronounced when he would perform onstage he credits his relationship with his second wife for allowing him to resume his career as a musician in his own words he said that he should have spent the early 2000s in a mental institution under heavy sedation due to the stresses of his condition however things have started to get a little bit easier but im not always in a positive happy place in 2002 he said that he felt that his successful treatment inhibited his creativity and songwritingin 2019 wilson postponed some concert dates due to worsening mental health his social media stated ive been struggling with stuff in my head and saying things i dont mean and i dont know why its sic something ive never dealt with before and we cant quite figure it out just yet the next month his social media declared that he had recovered and would resume touring interviews during his comeback in the late 1970s wilson stated that he believed interviews are for publicity at the time he often solicited drugs from journalists midinterview leaf writes that this was a game on brians part as one friend notes if he had really wanted to get drugs he would have known where to get them nonetheless journalist alexis petridis characterized wilsons interviews from this period as heartbreaking and horrifying in equal measure depicting a halting visibly terrified man who said he felt like a prisoner in later years many writers have accused wilson of being difficult to interview as his responses are usually curt or lacking in substance edgers wrote in 2000 that no writer will ever understand brian wilson as wilson often gives clipped and conflicting answers to questions both pointed and banal and generally makes it clear to interviewers that he would rather be somewhere else and thats when hes feeling good according to salon writer peter gilstrap in 2015 hes also been known to get up extend a hand and blurt out thanks well before the allotted time is up and sometimes he just gets tired and shuts down none of this however is due to a bad attitudeduring one 2007 interview wilson was asked about good movies he had watched recently and answered with norbit then asked for his favorite movie ever wilson again answered norbit writing in a spin piece marking the tenth anniversary of the exchange journalist winston cookwilson no relation referred to it as a typical example of brians terseness and jokingly as one of the most important blog posts in recent american historywilson has admitted to having a poor memory and occasionally lying in interviews to test people david oppenheim who interviewed wilson in 1966 remembered that we tried to talk with him but didnt get much out of him some guy said hes not verbal journalist verlyn klinkenborg who interviewed wilson in 1988 observed that although wilson has a reputation for blurting out the truth no matter how unflattering it may be in reality the truth he pours out it seems is whats true for him at that moment and if you ask him the same question the next day he may give you another truthful answer thats 180 degrees removed in 2017 the charlotte observers theoden janes surmised that while his past struggles with mental illness are widely documented wilson was still faring well enough to author his second memoir as well as to embark on a hugely ambitious concert tour so presumably is capable of telling people who work for him that hes not up for interviews if he isnt cultural impact and influence sales achievements from 1962 to 1979 wilson wrote or cowrote more than two dozen us top 40 hits for the beach boys eleven of those reached the top 10 including the numberones i get around 1964 help me rhonda 1965 and good vibrations 1966 three more that he produced but did not write were the bands barbara ann number 2 in 1965 sloop john b number 3 in 1966 and rock and roll music number 5 in 1976 among his other top 10 hits wilson cowrote jan and deans surf city the first charttopping surf song and dead mans curve number 8 in 1963 and the hondells little honda number 9 in 1964 popular music and record production wilson is widely regarded as one of the most innovative and significant songwriters of the late 20th century writing on the topic of his harmonic ingenuity musicologist philip lambert states that wilsons harmonic language represents a mastery and expansion of the britishamerican pop idiom of the 1960s and that his range of harmonic imagination represents a distinguished contribution to music in the second half of the twentieth century and beyond balancing the achievements of his artistic forebearsthe level of creative control that wilson asserted over his own record output was unprecedented in the music industry leading him to become the first pop artist credited for writing arranging producing and performing his own material although there had been numerous examples of artists who were essentially selfproduced wilson distinguished himself for having directed every phase of an albums production biographer james murphy writes no other recording artist had wrested complete creative control of his music away from a major record company its recording studios engineers and the watchful but often intrusive ar man assigned to produce the group armed with this unprecedented artistic freedom brian began transforming popular music and equally important the industrys perception of it in addition to being one of the first music producer auteurs wilson helped popularize the idea of the recording studio as a compositional tool and he was the first rock producer to use the studio in this fashion granata writes that wilsons authoritative approach affected his contemporaries and thus redefined the role of the producer in his 2015 book electric shock peter doggett identifies wilson as the most emblematic artist of an era when some of the most notorious pop battles were conducted between idealistic musicians and the businessmen who had to finance their increasingly crazy ideas brians brother carl commented record companies were used to having absolute control over their artists but what could they say brian made good records beatles producer george martin said no one made a greater impact on the beatles than brian the musician who challenged them most of all jimmy webb explained as far as a major modern producer who was working right in the middle of the pop milieu no one was doing what brian was doing we didnt even know that it was possible until he did it david crosby of the byrds remarked of wilson he was the most highly regarded pop musician in america hands down everybody by that time had figured out who was writing it all and who was arranging it allhis accomplishments as a producer effectively set a precedent that allowed subsequent bands and artists to enter a recording studio and act as producers either autonomously or in conjunction with other like minds and music producers afterward drew on his influence following his exercise of total creative autonomy wilson ignited an explosion of likeminded california producers supplanting new york as the center of popular records then wilson pioneered project recording where an artist records by himself instead of going into an established studiothe 1967 cbs documentary inside pop the rock revolution hosted by the classical conductor leonard bernstein described wilson as one of todays most important pop musicians in virgil moorefields 2010 book the producer as composer shaping the sounds of popular music wilson is acknowledged as a brilliant producer and a major innovator in the field of music production many other musicians have voiced admiration for wilson or cited him as an influence including bob dylan neil young ray davies john cale david byrne todd rundgren patti smith mick jagger keith richards eric clapton bruce springsteen randy newman ray charles and chrissie hynde art pop pop art psychedelia and progressive music further to his invention of new musical textures and his novel applications of quasisymphonic orchestras wilson helped propel the mid1960s art pop movement and with pet sounds was immediately heralded as art rocks leading figure carlin writes that wilson originated a new kind of artrock that would combine the transcendent possibilities of art with the mainstream accessibility of pop music according to journalist erik davis not only did he write a soundtrack to the early 60s but brian let loose a delicate and joyful art pop unique in music history and presaged the mellowness so fundamental to 70s california popacademic larry starr writes in a sense brian wilson was the first selfconscious secondgeneration rock n roller as well as the first fully realized example of both an innovative and majorly successful pop musician starr credits wilson with establishing a successful career model that was then followed by the beatles and other mid1960s british invasion acts start out by demonstrating a mastery of the basic early rock n roll ballad and uptempo styles create original material based on and extending those styles eventually branch out totally beyond the traditional forms sounds and lyric content of rock n roll to create something truly different and unique velvet underground cofounder lou reed who was mentored by andy warhol wrote in 1966 there is no god and brian wilson is his son van dyke parks stated brian wilson was not imitative he was inventive for people who dont write songs its hard to understand how inventive he really was parks elaborated that wilson made music as accessible as a cartoon and yet rewarded repeated listening as much as bach and he too suggested that wilsons sensibilities overlapped with those espoused by other pop artists of the era including warhol and roy lichtenstein in his 1969 book awopbopaloobop alopbamboom the golden age of rock nik cohn recognizes wilson as a creator of genuine pop art simply hed taken high school and raised it to completely new levels hed turned it into mythunder wilsons creative leadership the beach boys became major contributors to the development of psychedelic music although they are rarely credited for this distinction in an editorial piece on sunshine pop a subgenre closely associated with psychedelia the av clubs noel murray recognized wilson as among studio rats that set the pace for how pop music could and should sound in the flower power era at once starryeyed and wistful murray added that wilson himself rarely produced true sunshine pop music but was still hugely influential to the genres developmentwilsons work with the beach boys especially on pet sounds good vibrations and smile marked the beginnings of progressive pop a genre that is distinguished by sophisticated and unorthodox approaches to pop music writing in 1978 david leaf identified wilsons 1960s productions as a chief influence on bands such as queen electric light orchestra elo 10cc and crosby stills nash young among others musicologist bill martin an author of books about progressive rock acknowledged wilsons influence on the prog movement particularly through his complex songwriting and basslines adding that wilson alongside the who frontman pete townshend showed that adolescence can be the subject of great musicwriting in 2016 the atlantics jason guriel credits pet sounds with inventing the modern pop album stating that wilson paved the way for auteurs and anticipated the rise of the producer and the modern popcentric era which privileges producer over artist and blurs the line between entertainment and art among the later artists situated within wilsons template are prince michael jackson radiohead and kanye west na√Øve art rockpop division and outsider music wilsons popularity and success is partly attributed to the perceived na√Øvet√© of his work and personality david marks opined that although wilsons early records could appear campy and corny brian was dead serious about them all and thats what made them work its hard to believe that anyone could be that naive and honest but he was thats what made those records so successful you could feel the sincerity in them in music journalist barney hoskyns description the particular appeal of wilsons genius can be traced to his singular naivety and ingenuousness alongside the fact that his band was the very obverse of hip john cale argued what brian came to mean was an ideal of na√Øvet√© and innocence pet sounds was adult and childlike at the same timethe most culturally significant tragedy in 1960s rock according to journalist richard goldstein was wilsons failure to overcome his insecurities and realize his full potential as a composer after having anticipated developments such as electronica and minimalism writing in 1981 sociomusicologist simon frith identified wilsons withdrawal in 1967 along with phil spectors selfimposed retirement in 1966 as the catalysts for the rockpop split that has afflicted american music ever since frith added that while the influence of both these producers was evident in 1967 hit songs by the electric prunes the turtles strawberry alarm clock tommy james and the shondells and the 5th dimension the most enduring and successful american pop act was the monkees which had been created as an obvious imitation of the beatlesspeaking in a 1997 interview musician sean ohagan felt that rock musics domination of mass culture following the mid1960s had the effect of artistically stifling contemporary pop composers who until then had been guided by wilsons increasingly ambitious creative advancements in her article which dubbed him the godfather of sensitive pop music journalist patricia c√°rdenas credits wilson with ultimately inspiring many musicians to value the craft of pop songwriting as much as the primal harddriving rock n roll the world had come to know since then by the mid1970s wilson had tied with expink floyd member syd barrett for rock musics foremost mythical casualty timothy white wrote that wilsons ensuing legend rivaled that of the california myth promoted by the beach boys while brackett characterized wilsons rise and fall and rise as a downright shakespearean story with wilson elevated to olympian status by every serious musician sinceultimately wilson became regarded as the most famous outsider musician author irwin chusid who codified the term outsider music noted wilson as a potentially unconvincing example of the genre due to wilsons commercial successes but argued that the musician should be considered an outsider due to his tormented background past issues with drug dependencies and unorthodox songwriting other critics have drawn comparisons between wilson and the outsider musician daniel johnston who also struggled with lifelong mental illness and a genius labeling alternative music and continued cultural resonance wilson has also been declared the godfather of punk indie rock and emo principally through his early records wilson alongside his collaborator mike love was a key influence on the development of punk rock and the movements evolution into indie rock according to critic carl wilson no relation to the beach boys carl wilson the ramones for instance seized on and subverted the early wilson template be true to your school became rocknroll high school the critic also notes for the artier branches of postpunk wilsons pained vulnerability his uses of offbeat instruments and his intricate harmonies not to mention the smile saga itself became a touchstone especially for such bands as pere ubu xtc u2 rem the pixies and my bloody valentinelater in the 20th century wilson became known as the godfather to an era of independently produced music that was heavily indebted to his melodic sensibilities chamber pop orchestrations and recording experiments author nathan wisemantrowse credited wilson alongside spector with having arguably pioneered in popular music the approach to the sheer physicality of sound an integral characteristic of the dream pop genre newer acts who were influenced by wilson or that voiced their admiration included robyn hitchcock redd kross the church rain parade big dipper the gobetweens psychic tv the feelies and the dbsmany of the most popular acts of the 1980s and 1990s recorded songs that celebrated or referenced wilsons music including rem bruce springsteen barenaked

development of nascent indie music scenes and chillwave in particular to the themes of wilsons songs and his reputation for being an emotionally fragile dude with mental health problems who coped by taking drugs writing in his 2011 book on the beach boys mark dillon stated that tributes to wilson remained common among musicians young enough to be his childrenwilsons influence continues to be

james callaghan wilson remained in the house of commons until retiring in 1983 when he was elevated to the house of lords as lord wilson of rievaulx historians evaluate wilson in terms of leading the labour party through difficult political issues with considerable skill wilsons reputation was low when he left office and was still poor in 2016 key issues he faced included the role of public ownership membership of the european communities and how to avoid committing british troops to the vietnam war wilsons approach to socialism was regarded by some in the labour party as too moderate by others too leftwing a member of labours soft left he joked about leading a cabinet made up mostly of social democrats comparing himself to a bolshevik revolutionary presiding over a tsarist cabinet but there was little to divide him ideologically from the majority of his cabinet his stated ambitions of substantially improving britains longterm economic performance applying technology more democratically and reducing inequality went to some extent unfulfilled early life wilson was born at warneford road cowlersley in the western suburbs of the mill town of huddersfield in the west

study modern history at jesus college oxford from 1934 at oxford wilson was moderately active in politics as a member of the liberal party but was strongly influenced by g d h cole his politics tutor r b mccallum considered wilson as the best student he ever had he graduated in ppe philosophy politics and economics with an outstanding first class bachelor of arts degree with alphas on every paper in the final examinations and a series of major academic awards biographer roy jenkins wrote academically his results put him among prime ministers in the category of peel gladstone asquith and no one else buthe lacked originality what he was superb at was the quick assimilation of knowledge combined with an ability to keep it ordered in his mind and to present it lucidly in a form welcome to his examiners he continued in academia becoming one of the youngest oxford dons of the century at the age of 21 he was a lecturer in economic history at new college from 1937 and a research fellow at university college marriage on new years day 1940 in the chapel of mansfield college oxford he married mary baldwin who remained his wife until his death mary wilson became a published poet they had

from the ira because of their fathers prominence war service on the outbreak of the second world war wilson volunteered for military service but was classed as a specialist and moved into the civil service instead for much of this time he was a research assistant to william beveridge the master of university college working on the issues of unemployment and the trade cycle wilson later became a statistician and economist for the coal industry he was director of economics and statistics at the ministry of fuel and power in 194344 and was made an obe for his serviceshe was to remain passionately interested in statistics becoming a fellow of the royal statistical society in 1943 as president of the board of trade he was the driving force behind the statistics of trade act 1947 which is still the authority governing most economic statistics in great britain he was instrumental as prime minister in appointing claus moser as head of the central statistical office and was president of the royal statistical society between 1972 and 1973 member of parliament 19451964 as the war drew to an end he searched for a seat to contest at the impending general election he was selected for the constituency of ormskirk then held by stephen kinghall wilson agreed to be adopted as the candidate immediately rather than delay until the election was called and was therefore compelled to resign from his position in the civil service he served as praelector in economics at university college between his resignation and his election to the house of commons he also used this time to write a new deal for coal which used his wartime experience to argue for the nationalisation of the coal mines on the grounds of the improved efficiency he predicted would ensue in the 1945 general election wilson won his seat in the labour landslide to his surprise he was immediately appointed to the government by prime minister clement attlee as parliamentary secretary to the ministry of works two years later he became secretary for overseas trade in which capacity he made several official trips to the soviet union to negotiate supply contracts the boundaries of his ormskirk constituency were significantly altered before the general election of 1950 he stood instead for the new seat of huyton near liverpool and was narrowly elected he served there for 33 years until 1983 cabinet minister 19471951 bonfire of controls wilson was appointed president of the board of trade on 29 september 1947 becoming at the age of 31 the youngest member of a british cabinet in the 20th century initially wilson favoured a more interventionist policy seeking requirements for government officials to be seated on private boards of directors further price controls and nationalizations of private industries which opposed government policy however he abandoned these plans after his colleagues disagreed he made it a priority to reduce wartime rationing which he referred to as a bonfire of controls wilson decided that the massive number of wartime controls was slowing the conversion to peacetime prosperity and he was committed to removing them as fast as possible he ended rationing of potatoes bread and jam as well as shoes and some other clothing controls in november 1948 wilson announced his board of trade had removed the need for over 200000 licenses and permits by march 1949 he promised to remove the need for another 900000 although meat remained in short supply and was still rationed as was petrol henry irvine argues that wilsons success with the bonfire controls established his reputation as a modernizing specialist with both the general public and the political elite irving also argues that the selection timing and especially the publicity wilson devoted to the bonfire represented the emerging skills of a brilliant young politician while each major bonfire was justified in terms of technical economic advantages it was selected and publicized widely to reach the largest possible audience so that everybody could understand that their bread and jam became free again three ambitious young men in mid1949 with chancellor of the exchequer stafford cripps having gone to switzerland in an attempt to recover his health wilson was one of a group of three young ministers all of them former economics dons and wartime civil servants convened to advise prime minister attlee on financial matters the others were douglas jay economic secretary to the treasury and hugh gaitskell minister of fuel and power both of whom soon grew to distrust him jay wrote of wilsons role in the debates over whether or not to devalue sterling that he changed sides three times within eight days and finished up facing both ways wilson was given the task during his swiss holiday of taking a letter to cripps informing him of the decision to devalue to which cripps had been opposed wilson had tarnished his reputation in both political and official circles although a successful minister he was regarded as selfimportant he was not seriously considered for the job of chancellor when cripps stepped down in october 1950it was given to gaitskellpossibly in part because of his cautious role during devaluationwilson was becoming known in the labour party as a leftwinger and joined aneurin bevan and john freeman in resigning from the government in april 1951 in protest at the introduction of national health service nhs medical charges to meet the financial demands imposed by the korean war at this time wilson was not yet regarded as a heavyweight politician hugh dalton referred to him scornfully as nye bevans dogafter labour lost the 1951 election he became the chairman of keep left bevans political group at the bitter morecambe conference in late 1952 wilson was one of the bevanites elected as constituency representatives to labours national executive committee nec whilst senior rightwingers such as dalton and herbert morrison were voted off shadow cabinet 19541963 wilson had never made much secret that his support of the leftwing aneurin bevan was opportunistic in early 1954 bevan resigned from the shadow cabinet elected by labour mps when the party was in opposition over labours support for the settingup of the southeast asia treaty organization seato wilson who had been runnerup in the elections stepped up to fill the vacant place he was supported in this by richard crossman but his actions angered bevan and the other bevaniteswilsons course in intraparty matters in the 1950s and early 1960s left him neither fully accepted nor trusted by the left or the right in the labour party despite his earlier association with bevan in 1955 he backed hugh gaitskell the rightwing candidate in internal labour party terms against bevan for the party leadership election gaitskell appointed him shadow chancellor of the exchequer in 1955 and he proved to be very effective one of his procedural moves caused a substantial delay to the progress of the governments finance bill in 1955 and his speeches as shadow chancellor from 1956 were widely praised for their clarity and wit he coined the term gnomes of z√ºrich to ridicule swiss bankers for selling britain short and pushing the pound sterling down by speculation he conducted an inquiry into the labour partys organisation following its defeat in the 1955 general election its report compared labours organisation to an antiquated penny farthing bicycle and made various recommendations for improvements unusually wilson combined the job of chairman of the house of commons public accounts committee with that of shadow chancellor from 1959 holding that position until 1963 gaitskells leadership was weakened after the labour partys 1959 defeat his controversial attempt to ditch labours commitment to nationalisation by scrapping clause four and his defeat at the 1960 party conference over a motion supporting unilateral nuclear disarmament bevan had died in july 1960 so wilson established himself as a leader of the labour left by launching an opportunistic but unsuccessful challenge to gaitskells leadership in november 1960 wilson would later be moved to the position of shadow foreign secretary in 1961 before he challenged for the deputy leadership in 1962 but was defeated by george brown opposition leader 196364 gaitskell died in january 1963 just as the labour party had begun to unite and appeared to have a very good chance of winning the next election with the macmillan government running into trouble timothy heppell has explored how wilson won the labour party leadership election wilson had alienated the right wing of the party by his angry attempts to defeat gaitskell in 1960 for the leadership and george brown in 1962 for the deputy leadership these misadventures gave wilson a reputation for disloyalty and divisiveness heppell identifies three factors whereby wilson overcame these disadvantages firstly he had united the partys left wing behind him and they showed no willingness to compromise secondly the right wing although more numerous was deeply split between brown and james callaghan wilson took the lead on the first ballot and gained momentum on the second finally brown proved a poor campaigner emphasizing divisive factors rather than his own credentials allowing wilson to emerge surprisingly as the unity candidate thus becoming the leader of the labour party and the leader of the oppositionat the partys 1963 annual conference wilson made his bestremembered speech on the implications of scientific and technological change he argued that the britain that is going to be forged in the white heat of this revolution will be no place for restrictive practices or for outdated measures on either side of industry this speech did much to set wilsons reputation as a technocrat not tied to the prevailing class systemlabours 1964 election campaign was aided by the profumo affair a ministerial sex scandal that had mortally wounded harold macmillan and hurt the conservatives wilson made capital without getting involved in the less salubrious aspects asked for a statement on the scandal he reportedly said no comment in glorious technicolor sir alec douglashome was an aristocrat who had given up his peerage to sit in the house of commons and become prime minister upon macmillans resignation to wilsons comment that he was out of touch with ordinary people since he was the 14th earl of home home retorted i suppose mr wilson is the fourteenth mr wilson first period as prime minister 19641970 labour won the 1964 general election with a narrow majority of four seats and wilson became prime minister the youngest person to hold that office since lord rosebery 70 years earlier during 1965 byelection losses reduced the governments majority to a single seat but in march 1966 wilson took the gamble of calling another general election the gamble paid off because this time labour achieved a 96seat majority over the conservatives who the previous year had made edward heath their leader domestic affairs the 19641970 labour government carried out a broad range of reforms during its time in office in such areas as social security civil liberties housing health education and workers rightsit is perhaps best remembered for the liberal social reforms introduced or supported by home secretary roy jenkins notable amongst these was the partial decriminalisation of male homosexuality and abortion reform of divorce laws the abolition of theatre censorship and capital punishment except for a small number of offences notably high treason and various pieces of legislation addressing race relations and racial discriminationhis government also undertook the easing of means testing for noncontributory welfare benefits the linking of pensions to earnings and the provision of industrialinjury benefits wilsons government also made significant reforms to education most notably the expansion of comprehensive education and the creation of the open university economic policies wilsons government put faith in economic planning as a way to solve britains economic problems the governments strategy involved setting up a department of economic affairs dea which would draw up a national plan which was intended to promote growth and investment wilson believed that scientific progress was the key to economic and social advancement as such he famously referred to the white heat of technology in reference to the modernisation of british industry this was to be achieved through a new ministry of technology shortened to mintech which would coordinate research and development and support the swift adoption of new technology by industry aided by governmentfunded infrastructure improvementsin practice however events derailed much of the initial optimism upon coming to power the government was informed that they had inherited an exceptionally large deficit of 800 million on britains external balance of trade this partly reflected the preceding governments expansive fiscal policy in the runup to the 1964 election immediately the pound came under enormous pressure and many economists advocated devaluation of the pound in response but wilson resisted reportedly in part out of concern that labour which had previously devalued sterling in 1949 would become tagged as the party of devaluation wilson also believed that a devaluation would disproportionately harm lowincome britons with savings and poorer commonwealth of nations countries in the sterling area the government instead opted to deal with the problem by imposing a temporary surcharge on imports and a series of deflationary measures designed to reduce demand and therefore the inflow of imports in the latter half of 1967 an attempt was made to prevent the recession in activity from going too far in the form of a stimulus to consumer durable spending through an easing of credit which in turn prevented a rise in unemploymentafter a costly battle market pressures forced the government to devalue the pound by 14 from 280 to 240 in november 1967 wilson was much criticised for a broadcast soon after in which he assured listeners that the pound in your pocket had not lost its value economic performance did show some improvement after the devaluation as economists had predicted the devaluation with accompanying austerity measures which ensured resources went into exports rather than domestic consumption successfully restored the trade balance to surplus by 1969 in retrospect wilson has been widely criticised for not devaluing earlier however he believed there were strong arguments against it including the fear that it would set off a round of competitive devaluations and concern about the impact price rises following a devaluation would have on people on low incomesthe governments decision over its first three years to defend sterlings parity with traditional deflationary measures ran counter to hopes for an expansionist push for growth the national plan produced by the dea in 1965 targeted an annual growth rate of 38 however under the restrained circumstances the actual average rate of growth between 1964 and 1970 was a far more modest 22 the dea itself was wound up in 1969 the governments other main initiative mintech did have some success at switching research and development spending from military to civilian purposes and of achieving increases in industrial productivity although persuading industry to adopt new technology proved more difficult than had been hoped faith in indicative planning as a pathway to growth embodied in the dea and mintech was at the time by no means confined to the labour party wilson built on foundations that had been laid by his conservative predecessors in the shape for example of the national economic development council known as neddy and its regional counterparts the little neddies government intervention in industry was greatly enhanced with the national economic development office greatly strengthened and the number of little neddies was increased from eight in 1964 to twentyone in 1970 the governments policy of selective economic intervention was later characterised by the establishment of a new superministry of technology a connexion not always publicly grasped under tony bennthe continued relevance of industrial nationalisation a centrepiece of the postwar labour governments programme had been a key point of contention in labours internal struggles of the 1950s and early 1960s wilsons predecessor as leader hugh gaitskell had tried in 1960 to tackle the controversy headon with a proposal to expunge clause four the public ownership clause from the partys constitution but had been forced to climb down wilson took a characteristically more subtle approach no significant expansion of public ownership took place under wilsons government however he placated the partys leftwing by renationalising the steel industry under the iron and steel act 1967 which had been denationalised by the conservatives in the 1950s creating the british steel corporationone innovation of the wilson government was the creation in 1968 of the girobank a publicly owned bank which operated via the general post office network as most workingclass people in the 1960s did not have bank accounts this was designed to serve their needs as such it was billed as the peoples bank girobank was a longterm success surviving until 2003wilsons government presided over a rate of unemployment which was low by historic and later standards but did rise during his period in office between 1964 and 1966 the average rate of unemployment was 16 while between 1966 and 1970 the average stood at 25 he had entered power at a time when unemployment stood at around 400000 it still stood at 371000 by early 1966 after a steady fall during 1965 but by march 1967 it stood at 631000 it fell again towards the end of the decade standing at 582000 by the time of the general election in june 1970despite the economic difficulties faced by wilsons government it was able to achieve important advances in several domestic policy areas as reflected by wilson in 1971 it was a government which faced disappointment after disappointment and none greater than the economic restraints in our ability to carry through the social revolution to which we were committed at the speed we would have wished yet despite those restraints and the need to transfer resources from domestic expenditure private and public to the needs of our export markets we carried through an expansion in the social services health welfare and housing unparalleled in our history social issues several liberalising social reforms were passed through parliament during wilsons first period in government these dealt with the death penalty homosexual acts abortion censorship and the voting age there were new restrictions on immigration wilson personally coming culturally from a provincial nonconformist background showed no particular enthusiasm for much of this agenda education education held special significance for a socialist of wilsons generation given its role in both opening up opportunities for children from workingclass backgrounds and enabling britain to seize the potential benefits of scientific advances under the first wilson government for the first time in british history more money was allocated to education than to defence wilson continued the rapid creation of new universities in line with the recommendations of the robbins report a bipartisan policy already in train when labour took power wilson promoted the concept of an open university to give adults who had missed out on tertiary education a second chance through parttime study and distance learning his political commitment included assigning implementation responsibility to baroness lee the widow of aneurin bevan by 1981 45000 students had received degrees through the open university money was also channelled into localauthority run colleges of educationwilsons record on secondary education is by contrast highly controversial pressure grew for the abolition of the selective principle underlying the elevenplus and replacement with comprehensive schools which would serve the full range of children see the article grammar schools debate comprehensive education became labour party policy from 1966 to 1970 the proportion of children in comprehensive schools increased from about 10 to over 30labour pressed local authorities to convert grammar schools into comprehensives conversion continued on a large scale during the subsequent conservative heath administration although the secretary of state margaret thatcher ended the compulsion of local governments to convert a major controversy that arose during wilsons first government was the decision that the government could not fulfil its longheld promise to raise the school leaving age to 16 because of the investment required in infrastructure such as extra classrooms and teachers overall public expenditure on education rose as a proportion of gnp from 48 in 1964 to 59 in 1968 and the number of teachers in training increased by more than a third between 1964 and 1967 the percentage of students staying on at school after the age of sixteen increased similarly and the student population increased by over 10 each year pupilteacher ratios were also steadily reduced as a result of the first wilson governments educational policies opportunities for workingclass children were improved while overall access to education in 1970 was broader than in 1964 as summarised by brian lapping the years 196470 were largely taken up with creating extra places in universities polytechnics technical colleges colleges of education preparing for the day when a new act would make it the right of a student on leaving school to have a place in an institution of further education in 1966 wilson was created the first chancellor of the newly created university of bradford a position he held until 1985 housing housing was a major policy area under the first wilson government during wilsons time in office from 1964 to 1970 more new houses were built than in the last six years of the previous conservative government the proportion of council housing rose from 42 to 50 of the total while the number of council homes built increased steadily from 119000 in 1964 to 133000 in 1965 and 142000 in 1966 allowing for demolitions 13 million new homes were built between 1965 and 1970 to encourage homeownership the government introduced the option mortgage scheme 1968 which made lowincome housebuyers eligible for subsidies equivalent to tax relief on mortgage interest payments this scheme had the effect of reducing housing costs for buyers on low incomes and enabling more people to become owneroccupiers in addition house owners were exempted from capital gains tax together with the option mortgage scheme this measure stimulated the private housing marketsignificant emphasis was also placed on town planning with new conservation areas introduced and a new generation of new towns built notably milton keynes the new towns acts of 1965 and 1968 together gave the government the authority through its ministries to designate any area of land as a site for a new town urban renewal many subsidies were allocated to local authorities faced with acute areas of severe poverty or other social problems the housing act 1969 provided local authorities with the duty of working out what to do about unsatisfactory areas local authorities could declare general improvement areas in which they would be able to buy up land and houses and spend environmental improvement grants on the same basis taking geographical areas of need a package was developed by the government which resembled a miniature poverty programme in july 1967 the government decided to pour money into what the plowden committee defined as educational priority areas povertystricken areas where children were environmentally deprived some poor innercity areas were subsequently granted epa status despite concerns that local education authorities would be unable to finance educational priority areas from 1968 to 1970 150 new schools were built under the educational priority programme social services and welfare according to tony atkinson social security received much more attention from the first wilson government than it did during the previous thirteen years of conservative government following its victory in the 1964 general election wilsons government began to increase social benefits prescription charges for medicines were abolished immediately while pensions were raised to a record 21 of average male industrial wages in 1966 the system of national assistance a social assistance scheme for the poor was overhauled and renamed supplementary benefit the means test was replaced with a statement of income and benefit rates for pensioners the great majority of claimants were increased granting them a real gain in income before the 1966 election the widows pension was tripled due to austerity measures following an economic crisis prescription charges were reintroduced in 1968 as an alternative to cutting the hospital building programme although those sections of the population who were most in need including supplementary benefit claimants the longterm sick children and pensioners were exempted from chargesthe widows earning rule was also abolished while a range of new social benefits was introduced an act was passed which replaced national assistance with supplementary benefits the new act laid down that people who satisfied its conditions were entitled to these noncontributory benefits unlike the national assistance scheme which operated like state charity for the worstoff the new supplementary benefits scheme was a right of every citizen who found himself or herself in severe difficulties those persons over the retirement age with no means who were considered to be unable to live on the basic pension which provided less than what the government deemed as necessary for subsistence became entitled to a longterm allowance of an extra few shillings a week some simplification of the procedure for claiming benefits was also introduced from 1966 an exceptionally severe disablement allowance was added for those claimants receiving constant attendance allowance which was paid to those with the higher or intermediate rates of constant attendance allowance and who were exceptionally severely disabled redundancy payments were introduced in 1965 to lessen the impact of unemployment and earningsrelated benefits for maternity unemployment sickness industrial injuries and widowhood were introduced in 1966 followed by the replacement of flatrate family allowances with an earningsrelated scheme in 1968 from july 1966 onwards the temporary allowance for widow of severely disabled pensioners was extended from 13 to 26 weeksincreases were made in pensions and other benefits during wilsons first year in office that were the largest ever real term increases carried out up until that point social security benefits were markedly increased during wilsons first two years in office as characterised by a budget passed in the final quarter of 1964 which raised the standard benefit rates for old age sickness and invalidity by 185 in 1965 the government increased the national assistance rate to a higher level relative to earnings and via annual adjustments broadly maintained the rate at between 19 and 20 of gross industrial earnings until the start of 1970 in the five years from 1964 up until the last increases made by the first wilson government pensions went up by 23 in real terms supplementary benefits by 26 in real terms and sickness and unemployment benefits by 153 in real terms largely as a result of the introduction of earningsrelated benefits in 1967 agriculture under the first wilson government subsidies for farmers were increased farmers who wished to leave the land or retire became eligible for grants or annuities if their holdings were sold for approved amalgamations and could receive those benefits whether they wished to remain in their farmhouses or not a small farmers scheme was also extended and from 1 december 1965 forty thousand more farmers became eligible for the maximum 1000 grant new grants to agriculture also encouraged the voluntary pooling of smallholdings and in cases where their land was purchased for noncommercial purposes tenantfarmers could now receive double the previous disturbance compensation a hill land improvement scheme introduced by the agriculture act 1967 provided 50 grants for a wide range of land improvements along with a supplementary 10 grant on drainage works benefitting hill land the agriculture act 1967 also provided grants to promote farm amalgamation and to compensate outgoers health the proportion of gnp spent on the national health service rose from 42 in 1964 to about 5 in 1969 this additional expenditure provided for an energetic revival of a policy of building health centres for general practitioners extra pay for doctors who served in areas particularly short of them significant growth in hospital staffing and a significant increase in a hospital building programme far more money was spent each year on the nhs than under the 195164 conservative governments while much more effort was put into modernising and reorganising the health service stronger central and regional organisations were established for bulk purchase of hospital supplies while some efforts were made to reduce inequalities in standards of care in addition the government increased the intake to medical schoolsthe 1966 doctors charter introduced allowances for rent and ancillary staff significantly increased the pay scales and changed the structure of payments to reflect both qualifications of doctors and the form of their practices ie group practice these changes not only led to higher morale but also resulted in the increased use of ancillary staff and nursing attachments growth in the number of health centres and group practices and a boost in the modernisation of practices in terms of equipment appointment systems and buildings the charter introduced a new system of payment for gps with refunds for surgery rents and rates to ensure that the costs of improving his surgery did not diminish the doctors income together with allowances for the greater part of ancillary staff costs in addition a royal commission on medical education was set up partly to draw up ideas for training gps since these doctors the largest group of all doctors in the country had previously not received any special training merely being those who at the end of their predoctoral courses did not go on for further training in any specialityin 1967 local authorities were empowered to provide free family planning advice and meanstested contraceptive devices in addition medical training was expanded following the todd report on medical education in 1968 in addition national health expenditure rose from 42 of gnp in 1964 to 5 in 1969 and spending on hospital construction doubled the health services and public health act 1968 empowered local authorities to maintain workshops for the elderly either directly or via the agency of a voluntary body a health advisory service was later established to investigate and confront the problems of longterm psychiatric and mentally subnormal hospitals in the wave of numerous scandals the clean air act 1968 extended powers to combat air pollution more money was also allocated to hospitals treating the mentally ill in addition a sports council was set up to improve facilities direct government expenditure on sports more than doubled from 09 million in 196465 to 2 million in 196768 while 11 regional sports councils had been set up by 1968 in wales five new health centres had been opened by 1968 whereas none had been opened from 1951 to 1964 while spending on health and welfare services in the region went up from 558 million in 196364 to 839 million in 196768 workers the industrial training act 1964 set up an industrial training board to encourage training for people in work and within 7 years there were 27 itbs covering employers with some 15 million workers from 1964 to 1968 the number of training places had doubled the docks and harbours act 1966 and the dock labour scheme 1967 reorganised the system of employment in the docks in order to put an end to casual employment the changes made to the dock labour scheme in 1967 ensured a complete end to casual labour on the docks effectively giving workers the security of jobs for life trade unions also benefited from the passage of the trade dispute act 1965 this restored the legal immunity of trade union officials thus ensuring that they could no longer be sued for threatening to strikethe first wilson government also encouraged married women to return to teaching and improved assistance board concessionary conditions for those teaching parttime by enabling them to qualify for pension rights and by formulating a uniform scale of payment throughout the country soon after coming into office midwives and nurses were given an 11 pay increase and according to one mp nurses also benefited from the largest pay rise they had received in a generation in may 1966 wilson announced 30 pay rises for doctors and dentistsa move which did not prove popular with unions as the national pay policy at the time was for rises of between 3 and 35much needed improvements were made in junior hospital doctors salaries from 1959 to 1970 while the earnings of manual workers increased by 75 the salaries of registrars more than doubled while those of house officers more than trebled most of these improvements such as for nurses came in the pay settlements of 1970 on a limited scale reports by the national board for prices and incomes encouraged incentive payments schemes to be developed in local government and elsewhere in february 1969 the government accepted an above the ceiling increase for farmworkers a lowpaid group some groups of professional workers such as nurses teachers and doctors gained substantial awards transport the travel concessions act 1964 one of the first acts passed by the first wilson government provided concessions to all pensioners travelling on buses operated by municipal transport authorities the transport act 1968 established the principle of government grants for transport authorities if uneconomic passenger services were justified on social grounds a national freight corporation was also established to provide integrated rail freight and road services public expenditure on roads steadily increased and stricter safety precautions were introduced such as the breathalyser test for drunken driving under the 1967 road traffic act the transport act gave a much needed financial boost to british rail treating them like they were a company which had become bankrupt but could now under new management carry on debtfree the act also established a national freight corporation and introduced government rail subsidies for passenger transport on the same basis as existing subsidies for roads to enable local authorities to improve public transport in their areasthe roadbuilding programme was also expanded with capital expenditure increased to 8 of gdp the highest level achieved by any postwar government central government expenditure on roads went up from 125 million in 196364 to 225 million in 196768 while a number of road safety regulations were introduced covering seat belts lorry drivers hours car and lorry standards and an experimental 70 mile per hour speed limit in scotland spending on trunk roads went up from 68 million in 196364 to 155 million in 196667 while in wales spending on welsh roads went up from 212 million in 196364 to 314 million in 196667 regional development encouragement of regional development was given increased attention under the first wilson government to narrow economic disparities between the various regions a policy was introduced in 1965 whereby any new government organisation should be established outside london and in 1967 the government decided to give preference to development areas a few government departments were also moved out of london with the royal mint moved to south wales the giro and inland revenue to bootle and the motor tax office to swansea a new special development status was also introduced in 1967 to provide even higher levels of assistance in 1966 five development areas covering half the population in the uk were established while subsidies were provided for employers recruiting new employees in the development areas a highlands and islands development board was also set up to reinvigorate the north of scotlandthe industrial development act 1966 changed the name of development districts parts of the country with higher levels of unemployment than the national average and which governments sought to encourage greater investment in to development areas and increased the percentage of the workforce covered by development schemes from 15 to 20 which mainly affected rural areas in scotland and wales tax allowances were replaced by grants to extend coverage to include firms which were not making a profit and in 1967 a regional employment premium was introduced whereas the existing schemes tended to favour capitalintensive projects this aimed for the first time at increasing employment in depressed areas set at 30s per employee per week and guaranteed for seven years the regional employment premium subsidised all manufacturing industry though not services in development areas amounting to an average subsidy of 7 of labour costsregional unemployment differentials were narrowed and spending on regional infrastructure was significantly increased between 196566 and 196970 yearly expenditure on new construction including power stations roads schools hospitals and housing rose by 41 in the united kingdom as a whole subsidies were also provided for various industries such as shipbuilding in clydeside which helped to prevent many job losses it is estimated that between 1964 and 1970 45000 government jobs were created outside london 21000 of which were located in the development areas the local employment act passed in march 1970 embodied the governments proposals for assistance to 54 intermediate employment exchange areas not classified as full development areasfunds allocated to regional assistance more than doubled from 40 million in 196465 to 82 million in 196970 and from 1964 to 1970 the number of factories completed was 50 higher than from 1960 to 1964 which helped to reduce unemployment in development areas in 1970 the unemployment rate in development areas was 167 times the national average compared to 221 times in 1964 although national rates of unemployment were higher in 1970 than in the early 1960s unemployment rates in the development areas were lower and had not increased for three years altogether the impact of the first wilson governments regional development policies was such that according to one historian the period 1963 to 1970 represented the most prolonged most intensive and most successful attack ever launched on regional problems in britain international development a new ministry of overseas development was established with its greatest success at the time being the introduction of interestfree loans for the poorest countries the minister of overseas development barbara castle set a standard in interest relief on loans to developing nations which resulted in changes to the loan policies of many donor countries a significant shift in the conduct of rich white nations to poor brown ones loans were introduced to developing countries on terms that were more favourable to them than those given by governments of all other developed countries at that time in addition castle was instrumental in setting up an institute of development studies at the university of sussex to devise ways of tackling global socioeconomic inequalities overseas aid suffered from the austerity measures introduced by the first wilson government in its last few years in office with british aid as a percentage of gnp falling from 053 in 1964 to 039 in 1969 taxation wilsons government made a variety of changes to the tax system largely under the influence of the hungarianborn economists nicholas kaldor and thomas balogh an idiosyncratic selective employment tax set was introduced that was designed to tax employment in the service sectors while subsidising employment in manufacturing the rationale proposed by its economist authors derived largely from claims about potential economies of scale and technological progress but wilson in his memoirs stressed the taxs revenueraising potential the set did not long survive the return of a conservative government of longerterm significance capital gains tax cgt was introduced across the uk on 6 april 1965 across his two periods in office wilson presided over significant increases in the overall tax burden in the uk in 1974 three weeks after forming a new government wilsons new chancellor denis healey partially reversed the 1971 reduction in the top rate of tax from 90 to 75 increasing it to 83 in his first budget which came into law in april 1974 this applied to incomes over 20000 equivalent to 221741 in 2021 and combined with a 15 surcharge on unearned income investments and dividends could add up to a 98 marginal rate of personal income tax in 1974 as many as 750000 people were liable to pay the top rate of income taxvarious changes were also made to the tax system which benefited workers on low and middle incomes married couples with low incomes benefited from the increases in the single personal allowance and marriage allowance in 1965 the regressive allowance for national insurance contributions was abolished and the single personal allowance marriage allowance and wifes earned income relief were increased these allowances were further increased in the tax years 196970 and 197071 increases in the age exemption and dependant relatives income limits benefited the lowincome elderly in 1967 new tax concessions were introduced for widowsincreases were made in some of the minor allowances in the 1969 finance act notably the additional personal allowance the age exemption and age relief and the dependent relative limit apart from the age relief further adjustments in these concessions were implemented in 19701968 saw the introduction of aggregation of the investment income of unmarried minors with the income of their parents according to michael meacher this change put an end to a previous inequity whereby two families in otherwise identical circumstances paid differing amounts of tax simply because in one case the child possessed property transferred to it by a grandparent while in the other case the grandparents identical property was inherited by the parentin the 1969 budget income tax was abolished for about 1 million of the lowestpaid and reduced for a further 600000 people while in the governments last budget introduced in 1970 two million small taxpayers were exempted from paying any income tax altogether liberal reforms a wide range of liberal measures were introduced during wilsons time in office the matrimonial proceedings and property act 1970 made provision for the welfare of children whose parents were about to divorce or be judicially separated with courts for instance granted wide powers to order financial provision for children in the form of maintenance payments made by either parent this legislation allowed courts to order provision for either spouse and recognised the contribution to the joint home made during marriage that same year spouses were given an equal share of household assets following divorce via the matrimonial property act the race relations act 1968 was also extended in 1968 and in 1970 the equal pay act 1970 was passed another important reform the welsh language act 1967 granted equal validity to the declining welsh language and encouraged its revival government expenditure was also increased on both sport and the arts the mines and quarries tips act 1969 passed in response to the aberfan disaster made provision for preventing disused tips from endangering members of the public in 1967 corporal punishment in borstals and prisons was abolished 7 regional associations were established to develop the arts and government expenditure on cultural activities rose from 77 million in 196464 to 153 million in 196869 a criminal injuries compensation board was also set up which had paid out over 2 million to victims of criminal violence by 1968the commons registration act 1965 provided for the registration of all common land and village greens whilst under the countryside act 1968 local authorities could provide facilities for enjoyment of such lands to which the public has access the family provision act 1966 amended a series of preexisting estate laws mainly related to persons who died intestate the legislation increased the amount that could be paid to surviving spouses if a will had not been left and also expanded upon the jurisdiction of county courts which were given the jurisdiction of high courts under certain circumstances when handling matters of estate the rights of adopted children were also improved with certain wording changed in the inheritance family provision act 1938 to bestow upon them the same rights as naturalborn children in 1968 the nurseries and childminders regulation act 1948 was updated to include more categories of childminders a year later the family law reform act 1969 was passed which allowed people born outside marriage to inherit on the intestacy of either parent in 1967 homosexuality was partially decriminalised in england wales only by the passage of the sexual offences act the public records act 1967 also introduced a thirtyyear rule for access to public records replacing a previous fiftyyear rule industrial relations wilson made periodic attempts to mitigate inflation largely through wageprice controlsbetter known in britain as prices and incomes policy as with indicative planning such controlsthough now generally out of favourwere widely adopted at that time by governments of different ideological complexions including the nixon administration in the united states partly as a result of this reliance the government tended to find itself repeatedly injected into major industrial disputes with latenight beer and sandwiches at number ten an almost routine culmination to such episodes among the most damaging of the numerous strikes during wilsons periods in office was a sixweek stoppage by the national union of seamen beginning shortly after wilsons reelection in 1966 and conducted he claimed by politically motivated men with public frustration over strikes mounting wilsons government in 1969 proposed a series of changes to the legal basis for industrial relations labour law which were outlined in a white paper in place of strife put forward by the employment secretary barbara castle following a confrontation with the trades union congress which strongly opposed the proposals and internal dissent from home secretary james callaghan the government substantially backeddown from its intentions the heath government 19701974 introduced the industrial relations act 1971 with many of the same ideas but this was largely repealed by the post1974 labour government some elements of these changes were subsequently to be enacted in modified form during the premiership of margaret thatcher record on income distribution despite the economic difficulties faced by the first wilson government it succeeded in maintaining low levels of unemployment and inflation during its time in office unemployment was kept below 27 and inflation for much of the 1960s remained below 4 living standards generally improved while public spending on housing social security transport research education and health went up by an average of more than 6 between 1964 and 1970 the average household grew steadily richer with the number of cars in the united kingdom rising from one to every 64 persons to one for every five persons in 1968 representing a net increase of three million cars on the road the rise in the standard of living was also characterised by increased ownership of various consumer durables from 1964 to 1969 as demonstrated by television sets from 88 to 90 refrigerators from 39 to 59 and washing machines from 54 to 64by 1970 income in britain was more equally distributed than in 1964 mainly because of increases in cash benefits including family allowancesaccording to the historian dominic sandbrook in its commitment to social services and public welfare the wilson government put together a record unmatched by any subsequent administration and the midsixties are justifiably seen as the golden age of the welfare state as noted by ben pimlott the gap between those on lowest incomes and the rest of the population had been significantly reduced under wilsons first government the first wilson government thus saw the distribution of income became more equal while reductions in poverty took place these achievements were mainly brought about by several increases in social welfare benefits such as supplementary benefit pensions and family allowances the latter of which were doubled between 1964 and 1970 although most of the increase in family allowances did not come about until 1968 a new system of rate rebates was introduced which benefited one million households by the end of the 1960s increases in national insurance benefits in 1965 1967 1968 and 1969 ensured that those dependent on state benefits saw their disposable incomes rise faster than manual wage earners while income differentials between lowerincome and higherincome workers were marginally narrowed greater progressivity was introduced in the tax system with greater emphasis on direct incomebased as opposed to indirect typically expenditurebased taxation as a means of raising revenue with the amount raised by the former increasing twice as much as that of the latter also despite an increase in unemployment the poor improved their share of the national income while that of the rich was slightly reduced despite various cutbacks after 1966 expenditure on services such as education and health was still much higher as a proportion of national wealth than in 1964 in addition by raising taxes to pay their reforms the government paid careful attention to the principle of redistribution with disposable incomes rising for the lowest paid while falling amongst the wealthiest during its time in officebetween 1964 and 1968 benefits in kind were significantly progressive in that over the period those in the lower half of the income scale benefited more than those in the upper half on average those receiving state benefits benefited more in terms of increases in real disposable income than the average manual worker or salaried employee between 1964 and 1969 from 1964 to 1969 lowwage earners did substantially better than other sections of the population in 1969 a married couple with two children were 115 per cent richer in real terms while for a couple with three children the corresponding increase was 145 and for a family with four children 165 from 1965 to 1968 the income of single pensioner households as a percentage of other one adult households rose from 489 to 525 for two pensioner households the equivalent increase was from 468 to 482 in addition mainly as a result of big increases in cash benefits unemployed persons and large families gained more in terms of real disposable income than the rest of the population during wilsons time in officeas noted by paul whiteley pensions sickness unemployment and supplementary benefits went up more in real terms under the first wilson government than under the preceding conservative administration to compare the conservative period of office with the labour period we can use the changes in benefits per year as a rough estimate of comparative performance for the conservatives and labour respectively increases in supplementary benefits per year were 35 and 52 percentage points for sickness and unemployment benefits 58 and 306 percentage points for pensions 38 and 46 and for family allowances 12 and 26 thus the poor the retired the sick and the unemployed did better in real terms under labour than they did under conservatives and families did worsebetween 1964 and 1968 cash benefits rose as a percentage of income for all households but more so for poorer than for wealthier households as noted by the economist michael stewart it seems indisputable that the high priority the labour government gave to expenditure on education and the health service had a favourable effect on income distributionfor a family with two children in the income range 676 to 816 per annum cash benefits rose from 4 of income in 1964 to 22 in 1968 compared with a change from 1 to 2 for a similar family in the income range 2122 to 2566 over the same period for benefits in kind the changes over the same period for similar families were from 21 to 29 for lowerincome families and from 9 to 10 for higherincome families when taking into account all benefits taxes and government expenditures on social services the first wilson government succeeded in bringing about a reduction in income inequality as noted by the historian kenneth o morgan in the long term therefore fortified by increases in supplementary and other benefits under the crossman regime in 196870 the welfare state had made some impact almost by inadvertence on social inequality and the maldistribution of real incomepublic expenditure as a percentage of gdp rose significantly under the 19641970 labour government from 34 in 196465 to nearly 38 of gdp by 196970 whilst expenditure on social services rose from 16 of national income in 1964 to 23 by 1970 these measures had a major impact on the living standards of lowincome britons with disposable incomes rising faster for lowincome groups than for highincome groups during the 1960s when measuring disposable income after taxation but including benefits the total disposable income of those on the highest incomes fell by 33 whilst the total disposable income of those on the lowest incomes rose by 104 as noted by one historian the net effect of labours financial policies was indeed to make the rich poorer and the poor richer external affairs united states wilson believed in a strong special relationship with the united states and wanted to highlight his dealings with the white house to strengthen his prestige as a statesman president lyndon b johnson disliked wilson and ignored any special relationship the vietnam war was a sore point johnson needed and asked for help to maintain american prestige wilson offered lukewarm verbal support and no military aid wilsons policy angered the leftwing of his labour party who opposed the vietnam war wilson and johnson also differed sharply on british economic weakness and its declining status as a world power historian jonathan colman concludes it made for the most unsatisfactory special relationship in the 20th century the only point of total agreement was that both johnson and wilson emphatically supported israel in the 1967 sixday war europe among the more challenging political dilemmas wilson faced was the issue of british membership of the european community the forerunner of the present european union an entry attempt was vetoed in 1963 by french president charles de gaulle the labour party in opposition had been divided on the issue with hugh gaitskell having come out in 1962 in opposition to britain joining the european community after initial hesitation wilsons government in may 1967 lodged the uks second application to join the european community it was vetoed by de gaulle in november 1967 after de gaulle lost power conservative prime minister edward heath negotiated britains admission to the ec in 1973 wilson in opposition showed political ingenuity in devising a position that both sides of the party could agree on opposing the terms negotiated by heath but not membership in principle labours 1974 manifesto included a pledge to renegotiate terms for britains membership and then hold a referendum on whether to stay in the ec on the new terms this was a constitutional procedure without precedent in british history following wilsons return to power the renegotiations with britains fellow ec members were carried out by wilson himself in tandem with foreign secretary james callaghan and they toured the capital cities of europe meeting their european counterparts the discussions focused primarily on britains net budgetary contribution to the ec as a small agricultural producer heavily dependent on imports britain suffered doubly from the dominance of i agricultural spending in the ec budget ii agricultural import taxes as a source of ec revenuesduring the renegotiations other eec members conceded as a partial offset the establishment of a significant european regional development fund erdf from which it was agreed that britain would be a major net beneficiaryin the subsequent referendum campaign rather than the normal british tradition of collective responsibility under which the government takes a policy position which all cabinet members are required to support publicly members of the government were free to present their views on either side of the question the electorate voted on 5 june 1975 to continue membership by a substantial majority asia american military involvement in vietnam escalated continuously from 1964 to 1968 and president lyndon b johnson brought pressure to bear for at least a token involvement of british military units wilson consistently avoided any commitment of british forces giving as reasons british military commitments to the malayan emergency and british cochairmanship of the 1954 geneva conferencehis government offered some rhetorical support for the us position most prominently in the defence offered by the foreign secretary michael stewart in a muchpublicised teachin or debate on vietnam on at least one occasion the british government made an unsuccessful effort to mediate in the conflict with wilson discussing peace proposals with alexei kosygin the chairman of the ussr council of ministers on 28 june 1966 wilson dissociated his government from american bombing of the cities of hanoi and haiphong in his memoirs wilson writes of selling lbj a bum steer a reference to johnsons texas roots which conjured up images of cattle and cowboys in british mindspart of the price paid by wilson after talks with president johnson in june 1967 for us assistance with the uk economy was his agreement to maintain a military presence east of suez in july 1967 defence secretary denis healey announced that britain would abandon her mainland bases east of suez by 1977 although airmobile forces would be retained which could if necessary be deployed in the region shortly afterwards in january 1968 wilson announced that the proposed timetable for this withdrawal was to be accelerated and that british forces were to be withdrawn from singapore malaysia and the persian gulf by the end of 1971wilson was known for his strongly proisrael views he was a particular friend of israeli premier golda meir though her tenure largely coincided with wilsons 19701974 hiatus another associate was west german chancellor willy brandt all three were members of the socialist international africa the british retreat from empire had made headway by 1964 and was to continue during wilsons administration southern rhodesia was not granted independence principally because wilson refused to grant independence to the white minority government headed by rhodesian prime minister ian smith which was not willing to extend unqualified voting rights to the native african population smiths defiant response was a unilateral declaration of independence on 11 november 1965 wilsons immediate recourse was to the united nations and in 1965 the security council imposed sanctions which were to last until official independence in 1979 this involved british warships blockading the port of beira to try to cause economic collapse in rhodesia wilson was applauded by most nations for taking a firm stand on the issue and none extended diplomatic recognition to the smith r√©gime a number of nations did not join in with sanctions undermining their efficiency certain sections of public opinion started to question their efficacy and to demand the toppling of the r√©gime by force wilson declined to intervene in rhodesia with military force believing the british population would not support such action against their kith and kin the two leaders met for discussions aboard british warships tiger in 1966 and fearless in 1968 smith subsequently attacked wilson in his memoirs accusing him of delaying tactics during negotiations and alleging duplicity wilson responded in kind questioning smiths good faith and suggesting that smith had moved the goalposts whenever a settlement appeared in sight the matter was still unresolved at the time of wilsons resignation in 1976 wilson had a good relationship with siaka stevens of sierra leone the two leaders attempted to work together to find a solution the question of biafra in nigeria defeat and return to opposition 19701974 by 1969 the labour party was suffering serious electoral reverses and by the turn of 1970 had lost a total of 16 seats in byelections since the previous general electionby 1970 the economy was showing signs of improvement and by may that year labour had overtaken the conservatives in the opinion polls wilson responded to this apparent recovery in his governments popularity by calling a general election but to the surprise of most observers was defeated at the polls by the conservatives under heath most opinion polls had predicted a labour win with a poll six days before the election showing a 124 labour lead writing in the aftermath of the election the times journalist george clark wrote that the 1970 contest would be remembered as the occasion when the people of the united kingdom hurled the findings of the opinion polls back into the faces of the pollsters and at the voting booths proved them wrongmost of them badly wrong heath and the conservatives had attacked wilson over the economy towards the end of the campaign bad trade figures for may added weight to heaths campaign and he claimed that a labour victory would result in a further devaluation wilson considered heaths claims irresponsible and damaging to the nation ultimately however the election saw labours vote share fall to its lowest since 1935 several prominent labour figures lost their seats notably george brown who was still deputy leader of the labour partywilson survived as leader of the labour party in opposition in august 1973 holidaying on the isles of scilly he tried to board a motorboat from a dinghy and stepped into the sea he was unable to get into the boat and was left in the cold water for more than half an hour hanging on to the fenders of the motorboat he was close to death before he was saved by paul wolff the father of novelist isabel wolff when word of the incident became public the following month wilson downplayed its severity it was taken up by the press and resulted in some embarrassment his press secretary joe haines tried to deflect some of the comment by blaming wilsons dog paddy for the problemeconomic conditions during the 1970s were becoming more difficult for britain and many other western economies as a result of the nixon shock and the 1973 oil crisis and the heath government in its turn was buffeted by economic adversity and industrial unrest notably including confrontation with the coalminers which led to the threeday week towards the end of 1973 and on 7 february 1974 with the crisis still ongoing heath called a snap election for 28 february second period as prime minister 19741976 labour won more seats though fewer votes than the conservative party in the general election in february 1974 which resulted in a hung parliament as heath was unable to persuade the liberals to form a coalition wilson returned to 10 downing street on 4 march 1974 as prime minister of a minority labour government he gained a threeseat majority in another election later that year on 10 october 1974 one of the key issues addressed during his second period in office was the referendum on british membership of the european community ec which took place in june 1975 labour had pledged in its february 1974 manifesto to renegotiate the terms of british accession to the ec and then to consult the public in a referendum on whether britain should stay in on the new terms although the government recommended a vote in favour of continued membership the cabinet was split on the issue and ministers were allowed to campaign on different sides of the question the referendum resulted in a near twotoone majority in favour of britain remaining in the ec domestic affairs the second wilson government made a major commitment to the expansion of the british welfare state with increased spending on education health and housing rents to pay for it it imposed controls and raised taxes on the rich it partially reversed the 1971 reduction in the top rate of tax from 90 to 75 increasing it to 83 in the first budget from new chancellor denis healey which came into law in april 1974 also implemented was an investment income surcharge which raised the top rate on investment income to 98 the highest level since the second world war despite its achievements in social policy wilsons government came under scrutiny in 1975 for the rise in the unemployment rate with the total number of britons out of work passing one million by that aprilwilsons second government came into office at a troubled time for the british economy due to a global recession and stagflation in large part this was due to the 1973 oil crisis and also the preceding governments inflationary attempts to boost growth in order to deal with inflation which peaked at 26 in 1975 the government negotiated a social contract with the trades union congress to implement a voluntary incomes policy in which pay rises were held down to limits set by the government this policy operated with reasonable success for the next few years and inflation fell to single figures by 1978 by 1976 the recession had ended and economic recovery began by 197879 living standards recovered to the level they had been in 197374 the labour governments of the 1970s did however manage to protect the living standards of many people from the worst effects of the recession and high inflation with pensions increasing by 20 in real terms between 1974 and 1979 while measures such as rent and price controls and food and transport subsidies mitigated the adverse impact on the living standards of many more peoplethe governments industrial policy was greatly influenced by the economist stuart holland and the secretary of state for industry tony benn the centrepiece of the policy was the national enterprise board neb which was established in 1975 and was intended to channel public investment into industry in return for taking a holding of equity in private companies the neb was intended to extend public ownership of the economy as well as investing in the regeneration of industry although it had some successes in that aim in practice one of its main activities became that of propping up failing companies such as british leyland the government also continued its policy of encouraging regional development by increasing regional employment premiums which had first been established in 1967 northern ireland wilsons earlier government had witnessed the outbreak of the troubles in northern ireland in response to a request from the government of northern ireland wilson agreed to deploy the british army in august 1969 to restore the peace while out of office in late 1971 wilson had formulated a 16point 15year programme that was designed to pave the way for the unification of ireland the proposal was not adopted by the then heath governmentin may 1974 when back in office as leader of a minority government wilson condemned the unionistcontrolled ulster workers council strike as a sectarian strike which was being done for sectarian purposes having no relation to this century but only to the seventeenth century he refused to pressure a reluctant british army to face down the ulster loyalist paramilitaries who were intimidating utility workers in a televised speech later he referred to the loyalist strikers and their supporters as spongers who expected britain to pay for their lifestyles the strike was eventually successful in breaking the powersharing northern ireland executive on 11 september 2008 bbc radio 4s document programme claimed to have unearthed a secret plancodenamed doomsdaywhich proposed to cut all of the united kingdoms constitutional ties with northern ireland and transform the province into an independent dominion document went on to claim that the doomsday plan was devised mainly by wilson and was kept a closely guarded secret the plan then allegedly lost momentum due in part it was claimed to warnings made by both the then foreign secretary james callaghan and the then irish minister for foreign affairs garret fitzgerald who admitted the 12000strong irish army would be unable to deal with the ensuing civil war later callaghan himself spoke and wrote despondently about the prospect for a britishderived solution to the northern ireland issue supporting a similar plan to push northern ireland towards independent statusin 1975 wilson secretly offered libyas dictator muammar gaddafi 14 million 500 million in 2009 values to stop arming the provisional irish republican army but gaddafi demanded a far greater sum of money this offer did not become publicly known until 2009 resignation when wilson entered office for the second time he had privately admitted that he had lost his enthusiasm for the role telling a close adviser in 1974 that i have been around this racetrack so often that i cannot generate any more enthusiasm for jumping any more hurdles on 16 march 1976 wilson announced his resignation as prime minister taking effect on 5 april he claimed that he had always planned on resigning at the age of 60 and that he was physically and mentally exhausted as early as the late 1960s he had been telling intimates like his doctor sir joseph stone later lord stone of hendon that he did not intend to serve more than eight or nine years as prime minister roy jenkins has suggested that wilson may have been motivated partly by the distaste for politics felt by his loyal and longsuffering wife mary his doctor had detected problems which would later be diagnosed as colon cancer and wilson had begun drinking brandy during the day to cope with stress in addition by 1976 he might already have been aware of the first stages of earlyonset alzheimers disease which was to cause both his formerly excellent memory and his powers of concentration to fail dramaticallywilsons prime ministers resignation honours included many businessmen and celebrities along with his political supporters his choice of appointments caused lasting damage to his reputation worsened by the suggestion that the first draft of the list had been written by his political secretary marcia williams on lavender notepaper it became known as the lavender list roy jenkins noted that wilsons retirement was disfigured by his at best eccentric resignation honours list which gave peerages or knighthoods to some adventurous business gentlemen several of whom were close neither to him nor to the labour party some of those whom wilson honoured included lord kagan the inventor of gannex wilsons preferred raincoat who was eventually imprisoned for fraud and sir eric miller who later committed suicide while under police investigation for corruption the labour party held an election to replace wilson as leader of the party and therefore prime minister six candidates stood in the first ballot in order of votes they were michael foot james callaghan roy jenkins tony benn denis healey and anthony crosland in the third ballot on 5 april callaghan defeated foot in a parliamentary vote of 176 to 137 thus becoming wilsons successor as prime minister and leader of the labour party and he continued to serve as prime minister until may 1979 as wilson wished to remain an mp after leaving office he was not immediately given the peerage customarily offered to retired prime ministers but instead was created a knight of the garter following his departure from the house of commons before the 1983 general election he was granted a life peerage as baron wilson of rievaulx of kirklees in the county of west yorkshire after rievaulx abbey in the north of his native yorkshire and kirklees the metropolitan borough which includes his hometown of huddersfield retirement and death 19761995 he was appointed in 1976 to chair the committee to review the functioning of financial institutions the wilson committee which reported in june 1980shortly after resigning as prime minister wilson was signed by david frost to host a series of interviewchat show programmes the pilot episode proved to be a flop as wilson appeared uncomfortable with the informality of the format wilson also hosted two editions of the bbc chat show friday night saturday morning he famously floundered in the role and in 2000 channel 4 chose one of his appearances as one of the 100 moments of tv hell a lifelong gilbert and sullivan fan in 1975 wilson joined the board of trustees of the doyly carte trust at the invitation of sir hugh wontner who was then the lord mayor of london at christmas 1978 wilson appeared on the morecambe and wise christmas special eric morecambes habit of appearing not to recognise the guest stars was repaid by wilson who referred to him throughout as morrycamby the mispronunciation of morecambes name made by ed sullivan when the pair appeared on his famous american television show wilson appeared on the show again in 1980 wilson was not especially active in the house of lords although he did initiate a debate on unemployment in may 1984 his last speech was in a debate on marine pilotage in 1986 when he commented as an elder brother of trinity house in the same year he played himself as prime minister in an anglia television drama inside story wilson continued regularly attending the house of lords until just over a year before his death the last sitting he attended was on 27 april 1994 he had a picture taken with other labour lords on 15 june 1994 just under a year before his death he died from colon cancer and alzheimers disease on 24 may 1995 aged 79 his death came five months before that of his predecessor alec douglashome wilsons memorial service was held in westminster abbey on 13 july 1995 it was attended by the prince of wales former prime ministers edward heath james callaghan and margaret thatcher incumbent prime minister john major and also tony blair then leader of the opposition and later prime minister wilson was buried at st marys old church st marys isles of scilly on 6 june his epitaph is tempus imperator rerum time the commander of things political style wilson regarded himself as a man of the people and did much to promote this image contrasting himself with the stereotypical aristocratic conservatives and other statesmen who had preceded him as an example of social mobility he largely retained his yorkshire accent other features of this persona included his working mans gannex raincoat his pipe the british pipesmokers council voted him pipe smoker of the year in 1965 and pipeman of the decade in 1976 though in private he preferred cigars his love of simple cooking and fondness for popular british relish hp sauce and his support for his home towns football team huddersfield town his first general election victory relied heavily on associating these downtoearth attributes with a sense that the uk urgently needed to modernise after thirteen years of tory misrulewilson exhibited his populist touch in june 1965 when he had the beatles honoured with the award of mbe such awards are officially bestowed by the monarch but are nominated by the prime minister of the day the award was popular with young people and contributed to a sense that the prime minister was in touch with the younger generation there were some protests by conservatives and elderly members of the military who were earlier recipients of the award but such protesters were in the minority critics claimed that wilson acted to solicit votes for the next general election which took place less than a year later but defenders noted that since the minimum voting age at that time was 21 this was hardly likely to impact many of the beatles fans who at that time were predominantly teenagers it cemented wilsons image as a modernistic leader and linked him to the burgeoning pride in the new britain typified by the beatles the beatles mentioned wilson rather negatively naming both him and his opponent edward heath in george harrisons song taxman the opener to 1966s revolverrecorded and released after the mbesin 1967 wilson had a different interaction with a musical ensemble he sued the pop group the move for libel after the bands manager tony secunda published a promotional postcard for the single flowers in the rain featuring a caricature depicting wilson in bed with his female assistant marcia williams gossip had hinted at an improper relationship though these rumours were never substantiated wilson won the case and all royalties from the song composed by move leader roy wood were assigned in perpetuity to a charity of wilsons choosingwilson coined the term selsdon man to refer to the free market policies of the conservative leader edward heath developed at a policy retreat held at the selsdon park hotel in early 1970 this phrase intended to evoke the primitive throwback qualities of anthropological discoveries such as piltdown man and swanscombe man was part of a british political tradition of referring to political trends by suffixing man other memorable phrases attributed to wilson include the white heat of the technological revolution and a week is a long time in politics meaning that political fortunes can change extremely rapidly in his broadcast after the 1967 devaluation of the pound wilson said this does not mean that the pound here in britainin your pocket or purseis worth any less and the phrase the pound in your pocket subsequently took on a life of its own reputation despite his successes wilsons reputation took a long time to start a recovery from the low ebb reached immediately following his second premiership the reinvention of the labour party would take the better part of two decades at the hands of neil kinnock john smith and electorally and most conclusively tony blair disillusion with britains weak economic performance and troubled industrial relations combined with active spadework by figures such as sir keith joseph had helped to make a radical market programme politically feasible for margaret thatcher which was in turn to influence the subsequent labour leadership especially under blair an opinion poll in september 2011 found that wilson came in third place when respondents were asked to name the best postwar labour party leader he was beaten only by john smith and tony blairaccording to glen ohara in 2006 much of the disillusionment with harold wilson as labours leader and prime minister was due to his perceived failure on the economic front he pledged not to devalue sterling but did exactly that in 1967 he promised to keep unemployment low but had by 1970 accepted a higher rate of joblessness than the conservatives had managed some of the elements in labours programme the emphasis on steadier growth for instance were probably misguided these problems and defeats have however obscured some of the real achievements of the period science and education spending grew very quickly industrial investment rose government was increasingly well informed and better advised about the performance of the economy in an increasingly unstable and rapidly changing economic environment this governments economic record is here shown to be if not hugely impressive then at least relatively creditable possible plots and conspiracy theories in 1963 soviet defector anatoliy golitsyn is said to have secretly claimed that wilson was a kgb agent the majority of intelligence officers did not believe that golitsyn was credible in this and various other claims but a significant number did most prominently james jesus angleton deputy director of operations for counterintelligence at the us central intelligence agency and factional strife broke out between the two groups former mi5 officer peter wright claimed in his memoirs spycatcher that 30 mi5 agents then collaborated in an attempt to undermine wilson he retracted that claim saying there was only one manin march 1987 james miller a former agent claimed that the ulster workers council strike of 1974 had been promoted by mi5 to help destabilise wilsons government in july 1987 labour mp ken livingstone used his maiden speech to raise the 1975 allegations of a former army press officer in northern ireland colin wallace who also alleged a plot to destabilise wilson chris mullin mp speaking on 23 november 1988 argued that sources other than peter wright supported claims of a longstanding attempt by mi5 to undermine wilsons governmenton the bbc television programme the plot against harold wilson broadcast on 16 march 2006 on bbc2 it was claimed there were threats of a coup d√©tat against the wilson government which were corroborated by leading figures of the time on both the left and the right wilson told two bbc journalists barrie penrose and roger courtiour who recorded the meetings on a cassette tape recorder that he feared he was being undermined by mi5 the first time was in the late 1960s after the wilson government devalued the pound sterling but the threat faded after conservative leader edward heath won the election of 1970 however after the 1972 british miners strike heath decided to hold an election to renew his mandate to govern in february 1974 but lost narrowly to wilson there was again talk of a military coup with rumours of lord mountbatten as head of an interim administration after wilson had been deposed in 1974 the british army occupied heathrow airport on the grounds of training for possible ira terrorist action at the airport although the military stated that this was a planned military exercise 10 downing street was not informed in advance and wilson himself interpreted it as a show of strength or warning being made by the armyhistorian christopher andrews official history of mi5 the defence of the realm the authorized history of mi5 included a chapter section e part 4 specifically alluding to a conspiracy instead of a plot against wilson in the 1970s the characterisation of harold wilson as paranoid does not take account of the political context of the time which was characterised by a paranoid political style generally which applied to both left and right including mi5 itself the suspicion of wilson and others towards the unlawful activities of the security services and other rightwing figures resulted from concrete domestic and international developments discussed in more detail below andrew is correct to be sceptical and there remains limited evidence of a plot if a plot is defined as a tightly organised highlevel conspiracy with a detailed plan however there is evidence of a conspiracy a loosely connected series of unlawful manoeuvres against an elected government by a group of likeminded figures the directorgeneral of the security service assured prime minister margaret thatcher and she told the house of commons on 6 may 1987 he has found no evidence of any truth in the allegations he has given me his personal assurance that the stories are false in particular he has advised me that all the security service officers who have been interviewed have categorically denied that they were involved in or were aware of any activities or plans to undermine or discredit lord wilson and his government when he was prime minister in 2009 the defence of the realm held that while mi5 kept a file on wilson from 1945 when he became an mpbecause communist civil servants claimed that he had similar political sympathiesthere was no bugging of his home or office and no conspiracy against him in 2010 newspaper reports made detailed allegations that the cabinet office had required that the section on bugging of 10 downing street be omitted from the history for wider public interest reasons in 1963 on macmillans orders following the profumo affair mi5 bugged the cabinet room the waiting room and the prime ministers study until the devices were removed in 1977 on callaghans orders from the records it is unclear if wilson or heath knew of the bugging and no recorded conversations were retained by mi5 so possibly the bugs were never activated professor andrew had previously recorded in the preface of the history that one significant excision as a result of these cabinet office requirements in the chapter on the wilson plot is i believe hard to justify giving credence to these new allegationsas a result of his concerns about the danger to british parliamentary democracy from these activities wilson issued instructions that no agency should ever bug the telephones of any members of parliament a policy still in place which came to be known as the wilson doctrine honours wilson was elected a fellow of the royal society frs in 1969 under statute 12 of the societys regulations which covers people who have rendered conspicuous service to the cause of science or are such that their election would be of signal benefit to the society in 2013 the government of bangladesh awarded wilson with the friends of liberation war honour for highlighting the plight of the people of bangladesh during the bangladesh liberation war statues and other tributes a portrait of harold wilson painted by the scottish portrait artist cowan dobson hangs today at university college oxford two statues of harold wilson stand in prominent places the first unveiled by the then prime minister tony blair in july 1999 stands outside huddersfield railway station in st georges square huddersfield costing 70000 the statue designed by sculptor ian walters is based on photographs taken in 1964 and depicts wilson in walking pose at the start of his first term as prime minister his widow mary requested that the eightfoottall monument not show wilson holding his famous pipe as she feared it would make the representation a caricaturea block of highrise flats owned by kirklees metropolitan district council in huddersfield is named after wilson in september 2006 tony blair unveiled a second bronze statue of wilson in the latters former constituency of huyton near liverpool the statue was created by liverpool sculptor tom murphy and blair paid tribute to wilsons legacy at the unveiling including the open university he added he also brought in a whole new culture a whole new country he made the country very very differentalso in 2006 a street on a new housing development in tividale west midlands was named wilson drive in honour of wilson along with neighbouring new development callaghan drive named after james callaghan it formed part of a large housing estate developed since

In 2014 he appeared in Paul Thomas Anderson's Inherent Vice, and Peter Bogdanovich's She's Funny That Way. Wilson is also known for his career as an onscreen comedian and member of the Frat Pack, which included starring roles in such comedies as Zoolander (2001), Starsky & Hutch (2004), Wedding Crashers (2005), You, Me and Dupree (2006), How Do You Know (2010), The Big Year (2011), and The Internship (2013).

His brothers Andrew and Luke are also actors. Wilson's parents are of Irish descent. He attended New Mexico Military Institute, amongst other schools. He later attended the University of Texas at Austin, where he pursued a Bachelor of Arts degree in English, but did not graduate. While in college, he met and was roommates with director and frequent collaborator Wes Anderson. == Career == === 1990s === After his film debut in Bottle Rocket (1996), Wilson co-wrote with Wes Anderson the script for Anderson's next two directorial films, Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums, for which they garnered an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay. While Wilson did not act in Rushmore he appears briefly in a photograph in the film. Wilson then landed a role in The Cable Guy, directed by Ben Stiller, an early admirer of Bottle Rocket. After appearing in supporting roles in action films like Anaconda and Armageddon and the horror film The Haunting, Wilson appeared in two dramatic roles: a supporting role in Permanent Midnight, which starred Stiller as a drug-addicted TV writer; and the lead role (as a serial killer) in The Minus Man, in which his future girlfriend, singer Sheryl Crow, was a co-star. === 2000s === Wilson starred in the 2000 comedy action film Shanghai Noon alongside Jackie Chan. The film grossed nearly $100 million worldwide. His fame continued to rise after starring alongside Ben Stiller and Will Ferrell in the 2001 film Zoolander.

Also in 2001, Wilson and Anderson collaborated on their third film, The Royal Tenenbaums, a financial and critical success. The film earned the writing team an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay.Wilson returned to the buddy-comedy genre in 2002 with the action comedy I Spy, co-starring Eddie Murphy.

He then reunited with Chan to make Shanghai Knights (2003), and co-starred in the film remake of the 1970s television series Starsky & Hutch (2004). Due to his busy schedule as an actor and an ongoing sinus condition, Wilson was unavailable to collaborate on the script for Wes Anderson's fourth feature film, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou. The 2004 film was ultimately co-written by filmmaker Noah Baumbach. However, Wilson did star in the film as Bill Murray's would-be son, Ned Plimpton; it was a role written specifically for him. In 2004, he and his brother Luke played the Wright brothers in the 2004 film Around the World in 80 Days.
